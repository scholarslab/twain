<head><b>HOW TO TELL A STORY</b></head>
<q>The Humorous Story an American Development.&#x2014;Its <lb/>
Difference from Comic and Witty Stories.</q>
<p><smcap>I do</smcap> not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to <lb/>
be told. I only claim to know how a story <lb/>
ought to be told, for I have been almost daily in the <lb/>
company of the most expert story-tellers for many <lb/>
years.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of stories, but only one <lb/>
difficult kind&#x2014;the humorous. I will talk mainly <lb/>
about that one. The humorous story is American, <lb/>
the comic story is English, the witty story is French. <lb/>
The humorous story depends for its effect upon the <lb/>
<i>manner</i> of the telling; the comic story and the witty <lb/>
story upon the <i>matter.</i></p>
<p>The humorous story may be spun out to great <lb/>
length, and may wander around as much as it <lb/>
pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the <lb/>
comic and witty stories must be brief and end with <lb/>
a point. The humorous story bubbles gently along, <lb/>
the others burst.</p>
<p>The humorous story is strictly a work of art&#x2014; <lb/>
high and delicate art&#x2014;and only an artist can tell it; <lb/>
<pb n="8"/>
but no art is necessary in telling the comic and the <lb/>
witty story; anybody can do it. The art of telling <lb/>
a humorous story&#x2014;understand, I mean by word of <lb/>
mouth, not print&#x2014;was created in America, and <lb/>
has remained at home.</p>
<p>The humorous story is told gravely; the teller <lb/>
does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly <lb/>
suspects that there is anything funny about it; but <lb/>
the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand <lb/>
that it is one of the funniest things he has ever <lb/>
heard, then tells it with eager delight, and is the <lb/>
first person to laugh when he gets through. And <lb/>
sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad <lb/>
and happy that he will repeat the "nub" of it and <lb/>
glance around from face to face, collecting applause, <lb/>
and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to see.</p>
<p>Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed <lb/>
humorous story finishes with a nub, point, snapper, <lb/>
or whatever you like to call it. Then the listener <lb/>
must be alert, for in many cases the teller will divert <lb/>
attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully <lb/>
casual and indifferent way, with the pretence that he <lb/>
does not know it is a nub.</p>
<p>Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal; then <lb/>
when the belated audience presently caught the joke <lb/>
he would look up with innocent surprise, as if <lb/>
wondering what they had found to laugh at. Dan <lb/>
Setchell used it before him, Nye and Riley and <lb/>
others use it to-day.</p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>But the teller of the comic story does not slur <lb/>
the nub; he shouts it at you&#x2014;every time. And <lb/>
when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, <lb/>
and Italy, he italicizes it, puts some whooping <lb/>
exclamation-points after it, and sometimes explains <lb/>
it in a parenthesis. All of which is very depressing, <lb/>
and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a <lb/>
better life.</p>
<p>Let me set down an instance of the comic method, <lb/>
using an anecdote which has been popular all over <lb/>
the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years. The <lb/>
teller tells it in this way:</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the wounded soldier</smcap>.</head>
<p>In the course of a certain battle a soldier whose <lb/>
leg had been shot off appealed to another soldier <lb/>
who was hurrying by to carry him to the rear, in- <lb/>
forming him at the same time of the loss which he <lb/>
had sustained; whereupon the generous son of <lb/>
Mars, shouldering the unfortunate, proceeded to <lb/>
carry out his desire. The bullets and cannon-balls <lb/>
were flying in all directions, and presently one of <lb/>
the latter took the wounded man's head off&#x2014;with- <lb/>
out, however, his deliverer being aware of it. In <lb/>
no long time he was hailed by an officer, who said: <lb/></p>
<p>"Where are you going with that carcass?" <lb/></p>
<p>"To the rear, sir&#x2014;he's lost his leg!" <lb/></p>
<p>"His leg, forsooth?" responded the astonished <lb/>
officer; "you mean his head, you booby."</p>
<p>Whereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his <lb/>
<pb n="10"/>
burden, and stood looking down upon it in great <lb/>
perplexity. At length he said:</p>
<p>"It is true, sir, just as you have said." Then <lb/>
after a pause he added," <i>But he</i> <smcap>told</smcap> <i>me</i> IT WAS HIS LEG!!!!!"</p>
<p>Here the narrator bursts into explosion after ex- <lb/>
plosion of thunderous horse-laughter, repeating that <lb/>
nub from time to time through his gaspings and <lb/>
shriekings and suffocatings.</p>
<p>It takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its <lb/>
comic-story form; and isn't worth the telling, after <lb/>
all. Put into the humorous-story form it takes ten <lb/>
minutes, and is about the funniest thing I have ever <lb/>
listened to&#x2014;as James Whitcomb Riley tells it.</p>
<p>He tells it in the character of a dull-witted old <lb/>
farmer who has just heard it for the first time, thinks <lb/>
it is unspeakably funny, and is trying to repeat it to <lb/>
a neighbor. But he can't remember it; so he gets <lb/>
all mixed up and wanders helplessly round and <lb/>
round, putting in tedious details that don't belong <lb/>
in the tale and only retard it; taking them out con- <lb/>
scientiously and putting in others that are just as <lb/>
useless; making minor mistakes now and then and <lb/>
stopping to correct them and explain how he came <lb/>
to make them; remembering things which he forgot <lb/>
to put in in their proper place and going back to <lb/>
put them in there; stopping his narrative a good <lb/>
while in order to try to recall the name of the soldier <lb/>
that was hurt, and finally remembering that the <lb/>
soldier's name was not mentioned, and remarking <lb/>
<pb n="11"/>
placidly that the name is of no real importance, <lb/>
anyway&#x2014;better, of course, if one knew it, but not <lb/>
essential, after all&#x2014;and so on, and so on, and so <lb/>
on.</p>
<p>The teller is innocent and happy and pleased with <lb/>
himself, and has to stop every little while to hold <lb/>
himself in and keep from laughing outright; and <lb/>
does hold in, but his body quakes in a jelly-like <lb/>
way with interior chuckles; and at the end of the <lb/>
ten minutes the audience have laughed until they <lb/>
are exhausted, and the tears are running down their <lb/>
faces.</p>
<p>The simplicity and innocence and sincerity and <lb/>
unconsciousness of the old farmer are perfectly <lb/>
simulated, and the result is a performance which is <lb/>
thoroughly charming and delicious. This is art&#x2014; <lb/>
and fine and beautiful, and only a master can com- <lb/>
pass it; but a machine could tell the other story.</p>
<p>To string incongruities and absurdities together in <lb/>
a wandering and sometimes purposeless way, and <lb/>
seem innocently unaware that they are absurdities, is <lb/>
the basis of the American art, if my position is <lb/>
correct. Another feature is the slurring of the <lb/>
point. A third is the dropping of a studied remark <lb/>
apparently without knowing it, as if one were think- <lb/>
ing aloud. The fourth and last is the pause.</p>
<p>Artemus Ward dealt in numbers three and four a <lb/>
good deal. He would begin to tell with great ani- <lb/>
mation something which he seemed to think was <lb/>
wonderful; then lose confidence, and after an <lb/>
<pb n="12"/>
apparently absent-minded pause add an incongru- <lb/>
ous remark in a soliloquizing way; and that was <lb/>
the remark intended to explode the mine&#x2014;and <lb/>
it did.</p>
<p>For instance, he would say eagerly, excitedly, "I <lb/>
once knew a man in New Zealand who hadn't a <lb/>
tooth in his head" &#x2014;here his animation would die <lb/>
out; a silent, reflective pause would follow, then he <lb/>
would say dreamily, and as if to himself, "and yet <lb/>
that man could beat a drum better than any man I <lb/>
ever saw."</p>
<p>The pause is an exceedingly important feature in <lb/>
any kind of story, and a frequently recurring feature, <lb/>
too. It is a dainty thing, and delicate, and also un- <lb/>
certain and treacherous; for it must be exactly the <lb/>
right length&#x2014;no more and no less&#x2014;or it fails of <lb/>
its purpose and makes trouble. If the pause is too <lb/>
short the impressive point is passed, and the audi- <lb/>
ence have had time to divine that a surprise is <lb/>
intended&#x2014;and then you can't surprise them, of <lb/>
course.</p>
<p>On the platform I used to tell a negro ghost story <lb/>
that had a pause in front of the snapper on the end, <lb/>
and that pause was the most important thing in the <lb/>
whole story. If I got it the right length precisely, <lb/>
I could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect <lb/>
enough to make some impressible girl deliver a <lb/>
startled little yelp and jump out of her seat&#x2014;and <lb/>
that was what I was after. This story was called <lb/>
"The Golden Arm," and was told in this fashion. <lb/>
<pb n="13"/>
You can practise with it yourself&#x2014;and mind you <lb/>
look out for the pause and get it right.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the golden arm</smcap>.</head>
<p>Once 'pon a time dey wuz a monsus mean man, <lb/>
en he live' way out in de prairie all 'lone by hisself, <lb/>

<head><b>IN DEFENCE OF HARRIET SHELLEY</b></head>
<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head>I</head>
<p><smcap>I have</smcap> committed sins, of course; but I have <lb/>
not committed enough of them to entitle me to <lb/>
the punishment of reduction to the bread and water <lb/>
of ordinary literature during six years when I might <lb/>
have been living on the fat diet spread for the <lb/>
righteous in Professor Dowden's <i>Life of Shelley,</i> if <lb/>
I had been justly dealt with.</p>
<p>During these six years I have been living a life of <lb/>
peaceful ignorance. I was not aware that Shelley's <lb/>
first wife was unfaithful to him, and that that was <lb/>
why he deserted her and wiped the stain from his <lb/>
sensitive honor by entering into soiled relations with <lb/>
Godwin's young daughter. This was all new to me <lb/>
when I heard it lately, and was told that the proofs <lb/>
of it were in this book, and that this book's verdict <lb/>
is accepted in the girls' colleges of America and its <lb/>
view taught in their literary classes.</p>
<p>In each of these six years multitudes of young <lb/>
people in our country have arrived at the Shelley- <lb/>
reading age. Are these six multitudes unacquainted <lb/>
with this life of Shelley? Perhaps they are; indeed, <lb/>
<pb n="17"/>
one may feel pretty sure that the great bulk of them <lb/>
are. To these, then, I address myself, in the hope <lb/>
that some account of this romantic historical fable <lb/>
and the fabulist's manner of constructing and adorn- <lb/>
ing it may interest them.</p>
<p>First, as to its literary style. Our negroes in <lb/>
America have several ways of entertaining them- <lb/>
selves which are not found among the whites any- <lb/>
where. Among these inventions of theirs is one <lb/>
which is particularly popular with them. It is a <lb/>
competition in elegant deportment. They hire a <lb/>
hall and bank the spectators' seats in rising tiers <lb/>
along the two sides, leaving all the middle stretch of <lb/>
the floor free. A cake is provided as a prize for <lb/>
the winner in the competition, and a bench of ex- <lb/>
perts in deportment is appointed to award it. Some- <lb/>
times there are as many as fifty contestants, male <lb/>
and female, and five hundred spectators. One at a <lb/>
time the contestants enter, clothed regardless of ex- <lb/>
pense in what each considers the perfection of style <lb/>
and taste, and walk down the vacant central space <lb/>
and back again with that multitude of critical eyes <lb/>
on them. All that the competitor knows of fine airs <lb/>
and graces he throws into his carriage, all that he <lb/>
knows of seductive expression he throws into his <lb/>
countenance. He may use all the helps he can <lb/>
devise: watch-chain to twirl with his fingers, cane <lb/>
to do graceful things with, snowy handkerchief to <lb/>
flourish and get artful effects out of, shiny new <lb/>
stovepipe hat to assist in his courtly bows; and the <lb/>
<pb n="18"/>
colored lady may have a fan to work up <i>her</i> effects <lb/>
with, and smile over and blush behind, and she <lb/>
may add other helps, according to her judgment. <lb/>
When the review by individual detail is over, a grand <lb/>
review of all the contestants in procession follows, <lb/>
with all the airs and graces and all the bowings and <lb/>
smirkings on exhibition at once, and this enables <lb/>
the bench of experts to make the necessary com- <lb/>
parisons and arrive at a verdict. The successful <lb/>
competitor gets the prize which I have before men- <lb/>
tioned, and an abundance of applause and envy <lb/>
along with it. The negroes have a name for this <lb/>
grave deportment-tournament; a name taken from <lb/>
the prize contended for. They call it a Cake- <lb/>
Walk.</p>
<p>This Shelley biography is a literary cake-walk. <lb/>
The ordinary forms of speech are absent from it. <lb/>
All the pages, all the paragraphs, walk by sedately, <lb/>
elegantly, not to say mincingly, in their Sunday- <lb/>
best, shiny and sleek, perfumed, and with <i>bouton- <lb/>
nieres</i> in their button-holes; it is rare to find even a <lb/>
chance sentence that has forgotten to dress. If the <lb/>
book wishes to tell us that Mary Godwin, child of <lb/>
sixteen, had known afflictions, the fact saunters <lb/>
forth in this nobby outfit: "Mary was herself not <lb/>
unlearned in the lore of pain"&#x2014;meaning by that <lb/>
that she had not always traveled on asphalt; or, as <lb/>
some authorities would frame it, that she had "been <lb/>
there herself," a form which, while preferable to the <lb/>
book's form, is still not to be recommended. If the <lb/>
<pb n="19"/>
book wishes to tell us that Harriet Shelley hired a <lb/>
wet-nurse, that commonplace fact gets turned into a <lb/>
dancing-master, who does his professional bow be- <lb/>
fore us in pumps and knee-breeches, with his fiddle <lb/>
under one arm and his crush-hat under the other, <lb/>
thus: "The beauty of Harriet's motherly relation <lb/>
to her babe was marred in Shelley's eyes by the <lb/>
introduction into his house of a hireling nurse <lb/>
to whom was delegated the mother's tenderest <lb/>
office."</p>
<p>This is perhaps the strangest book that has seen <lb/>
the light since Frankenstein. Indeed, it is a Frank- <lb/>
enstein itself; a Frankenstein with the original in- <lb/>
firmity supplemented by a new one; a Frankenstein <lb/>
with the reasoning faculty wanting. Yet it believes <lb/>
it can reason, and is always trying. It is not con- <lb/>
tent to leave a mountain of fact standing in the clear <lb/>
sunshine, where the simplest reader can perceive its <lb/>
form, its details, and its relation to the rest of the <lb/>
landscape, but thinks it must help him examine it <lb/>
and understand it; so its drifting mind settles upon <lb/>
it with that intent, but always with one and the same <lb/>
result: there is a change of temperature and the <lb/>
mountain is hid in a fog. Every time it sets up a <lb/>
premise and starts to reason from it, there is a sur- <lb/>
prise in store for the reader. It is strangely near- <lb/>
sighted, cross-eyed, and purblind. Sometimes when <lb/>
a mastodon walks across the field of its vision it <lb/>
takes it for a rat; at other times it does not see it <lb/>
at all.</p>

<p>The materials of this biographical fable are facts, <lb/>
rumors, and poetry. They are connected together <lb/>
and harmonized by the help of suggestion, conjec- <lb/>
ture, innuendo, perversion, and semi-suppression.</p>
<p>The fable has a distinct object in view, but this <lb/>
object is not acknowledged in set words. Percy <lb/>
Bysshe Shelley has done something which in the <lb/>
case of other men is called a grave crime; it must <lb/>
be shown that in his case it is not that, because he <lb/>
does not think as other men do about these things.</p>
<p>Ought not that to be enough, if the fabulist is <lb/>
serious? Having proved that a crime is not a crime, <lb/>
was it worth while to go on and fasten the respon- <lb/>
sibility of a crime which was not a crime upon some- <lb/>
body else? What is the use of hunting down and <lb/>
holding to bitter account people who are responsible <lb/>
for other people's innocent acts?</p>
<p>Still, the fabulist thinks it a good idea to do that. <lb/>
In his view Shelley's first wife, Harriet, free of all <lb/>
offense as far as we have historical facts for guidance, <lb/>
must be held unforgivably responsible for her hus- <lb/>
band's innocent act in deserting her and taking up <lb/>
with another woman.</p>
<p>Any one will suspect that this task has its difficult- <lb/>
ties. Any one will divine that nice work is necessary <lb/>
here, cautious work, wily work, and that there is <lb/>
entertainment to be had in watching the magician do <lb/>
it. There is indeed entertainment in watching him. <lb/>
He arranges his facts, his rumors, and his poems on <lb/>
his table in full view of the house, and shows you <lb/>
<pb n="21"/>
that everything is there&#x2014;no deception, everything <lb/>
fair and above board. And this is apparently true, <lb/>
yet there is a defect, for some of his best stock is <lb/>
hid in an appendix-basket behind the door, and you <lb/>
do not come upon it until the exhibition is over and <lb/>
the enchantment of your mind accomplished&#x2014;as <lb/>
the magician thinks.</p>
<p>There is an insistent atmosphere of candor and <lb/>
fairness about this book which is engaging at first, <lb/>
then a little burdensome, then a trifle fatiguing, then <lb/>
progressively suspicious, annoying, irritating, and <lb/>
oppressive. It takes one some little time to find out <lb/>
that phrases which seem intended to guide the reader <lb/>
aright are there to mislead him; that phrases which <lb/>
seem intended to throw light are there to throw <lb/>
darkness; that phrases which seem intended to <lb/>
interpret a fact are there to misinterpret it; that <lb/>
phrases which seem intended to forestall prejudice <lb/>
are there to create it; that phrases which seem anti- <lb/>
dotes are poisons in disguise. The naked facts <lb/>
arrayed in the book establish Shelley's guilt in that <lb/>
one episode which disfigures his otherwise super- <lb/>
latively lofty and beautiful life; but the historian's <lb/>
careful and methodical misinterpretation of them <lb/>
transfers the responsibility to the wife's shoulders&#x2014; <lb/>
as he persuades himself. The few meagre facts of <lb/>
Harriet Shelley's life, as furnished by the book, <lb/>
acquit her of offense; but by calling in the for- <lb/>
bidden helps of rumor, gossip, conjecture, insinua- <lb/>
tion, and innuendo he destroys her character and <lb/>
<pb n="22"/>
rehabilitates Shelley's&#x2014;as he believes. And in <lb/>
truth his unheroic work has not been barren of the <lb/>
results he aimed at; as witness the assertion made <lb/>
to me that girls in the colleges of America are <lb/>
taught that Harriet Shelley put a stain upon her <lb/>
husband's honor, and that that was what stung him <lb/>
into repurifying himself by deserting her and his <lb/>
child and entering into scandalous relations with a <lb/>
school-girl acquaintance of his.</p>
<p>If that assertion is true, they probably use a re- <lb/>
duction of this work in those colleges, maybe only <lb/>
a sketch outlined from it. Such a thing as that <lb/>
could be harmful and misleading. They ought to <lb/>
cast it out and put the whole book in its place. It <lb/>
would not deceive. It would not deceive the janitor.</p>
<p>All of this book is interesting on account of the <lb/>
sorcerer's methods and the attractiveness of some of <lb/>
his characters and the repulsiveness of the rest, but <lb/>
no part of it is so much so as are the chapters <lb/>
wherein he tries to think he thinks he sets forth the <lb/>
causes which led to Shelley's desertion of his wife in <lb/>
1814.</p>
<p>Harriet Westbrook was a school-girl sixteen years <lb/>
old. Shelley was teeming with advanced thought. <lb/>
He believed that Christianity was a degrading and <lb/>
selfish superstition, and he had a deep and sincere <lb/>
desire to rescue one of his sisters from it. Harriet <lb/>
was impressed by his various philosophies and <lb/>
looked upon him as an intellectual wonder&#x2014;which <lb/>
indeed he was. He had an idea that she could give <lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
him valuable help in his scheme regarding his sister; <lb/>
therefore he asked her to correspond with him. She <lb/>
was quite willing. Shelley was not thinking of love, <lb/>
for he was just getting over a passion for his cousin, <lb/>
Harriet Grove, and just getting well steeped in one <lb/>
for Miss Hitchener, a school-teacher. What might <lb/>
happen to Harriet Westbrook before the letter- <lb/>
writing was ended did not enter his mind. Yet an <lb/>
older person could have made a good guess at it, <lb/>
for in person Shelley was as beautiful as an angel, <lb/>
he was frank, sweet, winning, unassuming, and so <lb/>
rich in unselfishness, generosities, and magnanimities <lb/>
that he made his whole generation seem poor in <lb/>
these great qualities by comparison. Besides, he was <lb/>
in distress. His college had expelled him for writing <lb/>
an atheistical pamphlet and afflicting the reverend <lb/>
heads of the university with it, his rich father and <lb/>
grandfather had closed their purses against him, his <lb/>
friends were cold. Necessarily, Harriet fell in love <lb/>
with him; and so deeply, indeed, that there was no <lb/>
way for Shelley to save her from suicide but to <lb/>
marry her. He believed himself to blame for this <lb/>
state of things, so the marriage took place. He was <lb/>
pretty fairly in love with Harriet, although he loved <lb/>
Miss Hitchener better. He wrote and explained the <lb/>
case to Miss Hitchener after the wedding, and he <lb/>
could not have been franker or more <i>na&#x00EF;ve</i> and less <lb/>
stirred up about the circumstance if the matter in <lb/>
issue had been a commercial transaction involving <lb/>
thirty-five dollars.</p>
<pb n="24"/>
<p>Shelley was nineteen. He was not a youth, but <lb/>
a man. He had never had any youth. He was an <lb/>
erratic and fantastic child during eighteen years, <lb/>
then he stepped into manhood, as one steps over a <lb/>
door-sill. He was curiously mature at nineteen in <lb/>
his ability to do independent thinking on the deep <lb/>
questions of life and to arrive at sharply definite <lb/>
decisions regarding them, and stick to them&#x2014;stick <lb/>
to them and stand by them at cost of bread, friend- <lb/>
ships, esteem, respect, and approbation.</p>
<p>For the sake of his opinions he was willing to <lb/>
sacrifice all these valuable things, and did sacrifice <lb/>
them; and went on doing it, too, when he could at <lb/>
any moment have made himself rich and supplied <lb/>
himself with friends and esteem by compromising <lb/>
with his father, at the moderate expense of throwing <lb/>
overboard one or two indifferent details of his cargo <lb/>
of principles.</p>
<p>He and Harriet eloped to Scotland and got mar- <lb/>
ried. They took lodgings in Edinburgh of a sort <lb/>
answerable to their purse, which was about empty, <lb/>
and there their life was a happy one and grew daily <lb/>
more so. They had only themselves for company, <lb/>
but they needed no additions to it. They were as <lb/>
cozy and contented as birds in a nest. Harriet sang <lb/>
evenings or read aloud; also she studied and tried <lb/>
to improve her mind, her husband instructing her in <lb/>
Latin. She was very beautiful, she was modest, <lb/>
quiet, genuine, and, according to her husband's <lb/>
testimony, she had no fine lady airs or aspirations <lb/>
<pb n="25"/>
about her. In Matthew Arnold's judgment, she <lb/>
was "a pleasing figure."</p>
<p>The pair remained five weeks in Edinburgh, and <lb/>
then took lodgings in York, where Shelley's college <lb/>
mate, Hogg, lived. Shelley presently ran down to <lb/>
London, and Hogg took this opportunity to make <lb/>
love to the young wife. She repulsed him, and re- <lb/>
ported the fact to her husband when he got back. <lb/>
It seems a pity that Shelley did not copy this credit- <lb/>
able conduct of hers some time or other when under <lb/>
temptation, so that we might have seen the author <lb/>
of his biography hang the miracle in the skies and <lb/>
squirt rainbows at it.</p>
<p>At the end of the first year of marriage&#x2014;the <lb/>
most trying year for any young couple, for then the <lb/>
mutual failings are coming one by one to light, and <lb/>
the necessary adjustments are being made in pain <lb/>
and tribulation&#x2014;Shelley was able to recognize that <lb/>
his marriage venture had been a safe one. As we <lb/>
have seen, his love for his wife had begun in a <lb/>
rather shallow way and with not much force, but <lb/>
now it was become deep and strong, which entitles <lb/>
his wife to a broad credit mark, one may admit. <lb/>
He addresses a long and loving poem to her, in <lb/>
which both passion and worship appear: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<head><i>Exhibit A</i></head>
<l rend="indent2">"O thou</l>
<l>Whose dear love gleamed upon the gloomy path</l>
<l>Which this lone spirit travelled,</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent">&#x2026; wilt thou not turn</l>
<pb n="26"/>
<l>Those spirit-beaming eyes and look on me,</l>
<l>Until I be assured that Earth is Heaven</l>
<l>And Heaven is Earth?</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Harriet! let death all mortal ties dissolve,</l>
<l>But ours shall not be mortal."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Shelley also wrote a sonnet to her in August of <lb/>
this same year in celebration of her birthday: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<head><i>Exhibit B</i></head>
<l>"Ever as now with Love and Virtue's glow</l>
<l rend="indent">May thy unwithering soul not cease to burn,</l>
<l>Still may thine heart with those pure thoughts o'erflow</l>
<l rend="indent">Which force from mine such quick and warm return."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Was the girl of seventeen glad and proud and <lb/>
happy? We may conjecture that she was.</p>
<p>That was the year 1812. Another year passed&#x2014; <lb/>
still happily, still successfully&#x2014;a child was born in <lb/>
June, 1813, and in September, three months later, <lb/>
Shelley addresses a poem to this child, Ianthe, in <lb/>
which he points out just when the little creature is <lb/>
most particularly dear to him: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<head><i>Exhibit C</i></head>
<l>"Dearest when most thy tender traits express</l>
<l>The image of thy mother's loveliness."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Up to this point the fabulist counsel for Shelley <lb/>
and prosecutor of his young wife has had easy sailing, <lb/>
but now his trouble begins, for Shelley is getting <lb/>
ready to make some unpleasant history for himself, <lb/>
and it will be necessary to put the blame of it on the <lb/>
wife.</p>
<p>Shelley had made the acquaintance of a charming <lb/>
<pb n="27"/>
gray-haired, young-hearted Mrs. Boinville, whose <lb/>
face "retained a certain youthful beauty"; she <lb/>
lived at Bracknell, and had a young daughter named <lb/>
Cornelia Turner, who was equipped with many fasci- <lb/>
nations. Apparently these people were sufficiently <lb/>
sentimental. Hogg says of Mrs. Boinville: <lb/>
<q>"The greater part of her associates were odious. I generally found <lb/>
there two or three sentimental young butchers, an eminently philo- <lb/>
sophical tinker, and several very unsophisticated medical practitioners or <lb/>
medical students, all of low origin and vulgar and offensive manners. <lb/>
They sighed, turned up their eyes, retailed philosophy, such as it was," <lb/>
etc.</q></p>
<p>Shelley moved to Bracknell, July 27th (this is <lb/>
still 1813) purposely to be near this unwholesome <lb/>
prairie-dogs' nest. The fabulist says: "It was the <lb/>
entrance into a world more amiable and exquisite <lb/>
than he had yet known."</p>
<p>"In this acquaintance the attraction was mutual" <lb/>
&#x2014; and presently it grew to be very mutual indeed, <lb/>
between Shelley and Cornelia Turner, when they <lb/>
got to studying the Italian poets together. Shelley, <lb/>
"responding like a tremulous instrument to every <lb/>
breath of passion or of sentiment," had his chance <lb/>
here. It took only four days for Cornelia's attract- <lb/>
tions to begin to dim Harriet's. Shelley arrived on <lb/>
the 27th of July; on the 31st he wrote a sonnet to <lb/>
Harriet in which "one detects already the little rift <lb/>
in the lover's lute which had seemed to be healed or <lb/>
never to have gaped at all when the later and hap- <lb/>
pier sonnet to Ianthe was written"&#x2014;in September, <lb/>
we remember: <lb/>
<pb n="28"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<head><i>Exhibit D</i> <lb/>
"EVENING. TO HARRIET</head>
<l>"O thou bright Sun! Beneath the dark blue line</l>
<l>Of western distance that sublime descendest,</l>
<l>And, gleaming lovelier as thy beams decline,</l>
<l>Thy million hues to every vapor lendest,</l>
<l>And over cobweb, lawn, and grove, and stream</l>
<l>Sheddest the liquid magic of thy light,</l>
<l>Till calm Earth, with the parting splendor bright,</l>
<l>Shows like the vision of a beauteous dream;</l>
<l>What gazer now with astronomic eye</l>
<l>Could coldly count the spots within thy sphere?</l>
<l>Such were thy lover, Harriet, could he fly</l>
<l>The thoughts of all that makes his passion dear,</l>
<l>And turning senseless from thy warm caress</l>
<l>Pick flaws in our close-woven happiness."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>I cannot find the "rift"; still it may be there. <lb/>
What the poem <i>seems</i> to say is, that a person would <lb/>
be coldly ungrateful who could consent to count and <lb/>
consider little spots and flaws in such a warm, great, <lb/>
satisfying sun as Harriet is. It is a "little rift <lb/>
which had seemed to be healed, <i>or</i> never to have <lb/>
gaped at all." That is, "one <i>detects"</i> a little rift <lb/>
which perhaps had never existed. How does one <lb/>
do that? How does one see the invisible? It is the <lb/>
fabulist's secret; he knows how to detect what does <lb/>
not exist, he knows how to see what is not seeable; <lb/>
it is his gift, and he works it many a time to poor <lb/>
dead Harriet Shelley's deep damage.</p>
<p>"As yet, however, if there was a speck upon <lb/>
Shelley's happiness it was no more than a speck" <lb/>
&#x2014; meaning the one which one detects where "it <lb/>
<pb n="29"/>
may never have gaped at all"&#x2014;"nor had Harriet <lb/>
cause for discontent."</p>
<p>Shelley's Latin instructions to his wife had ceased. <lb/>
"From a teacher he had now become a pupil." <lb/>
Mrs. Boinville and her young married daughter <lb/>
Cornelia were teaching him Italian poetry; a fact <lb/>
which warns one to receive with some caution that <lb/>
other statement that Harriet had no "cause for dis- <lb/>
content."</p>
<p>Shelley had stopped instructing Harriet in Latin, <lb/>
as before mentioned. The biographer thinks that <lb/>
the busy life in London some time back, and the <lb/>
intrusion of the baby, account for this. These were <lb/>
hindrances, but were there no others? He is always <lb/>
overlooking a detail here and there that might be <lb/>
valuable in helping us understand a situation. For <lb/>
instance, when a man has been hard at work at the <lb/>
Italian poets with a pretty woman, hour after hour, <lb/>
and responding like a tremulous instrument to every <lb/>
breath of passion or of sentiment in the meantime, <lb/>
that man is dog-tired when he gets home, and he <lb/>
<i>can't</i> teach his wife Latin; it would be unreasonable <lb/>
to expect it.</p>
<p>Up to this time we have submitted to having Mrs, <lb/>
Boinville pushed upon us as ostensibly concerned in <lb/>
these Italian lessons, but the biographer drops her <lb/>
now, of his own accord. Cornelia "perhaps" is <lb/>
sole teacher. Hogg says she was a prey to a kind <lb/>
of sweet melancholy, arising from causes purely <lb/>
imaginary; she required consolation, and found it <lb/>
<pb n="30"/>
in Petrarch. He also says, "Bysshe entered at once <lb/>
fully into her views and caught the soft infection, <lb/>
breathing the tenderest and sweetest melancholy, <lb/>
as every true poet ought."</p>
<p>Then the author of the book interlards a most <lb/>
stately and fine compliment to Cornelia, furnished <lb/>
by a man of approved judgment who knew her well <lb/>
"in later years." It is a very good compliment <lb/>
indeed, and she no doubt deserved it in her "later <lb/>
years," when she had for generations ceased to be <lb/>
sentimental and lackadaisical, and was no longer en- <lb/>
gaged in enchanting young husbands and sowing <lb/>
sorrow for young wives. But why is that compli- <lb/>
ment to that old gentlewoman intruded there? Is it <lb/>
to make the reader believe she was well-chosen and <lb/>
safe society for a young, sentimental husband? The <lb/>
biographer's device was not well planned. That old <lb/>
person was not present&#x2014;it was her other self that <lb/>
was there, her young, sentimental, melancholy, <lb/>
warm-blooded self, in those early sweet times before <lb/>
antiquity had cooled her off and mossed her back.</p>
<p>"In choosing for friends such women as Mrs. <lb/>
Newton, Mrs. Boinville, and Cornelia Turner, Shel- <lb/>
ley gave good proof of his insight and discrimi- <lb/>
nation." That is the fabulist's opinion&#x2014;Harriet <lb/>
Shelley's is not reported.</p>
<p>Early in August, Shelley was in London trying <lb/>
to raise money. In September he wrote the poem <lb/>
to the baby, already quoted from. In the first week <lb/>
of October Shelley and family went to Warwick, <lb/>
<pb n="31"/>
then to Edinburgh, arriving there about the middle <lb/>
of the month.</p>
<p>"Harriet was happy." Why? The author fur- <lb/>
nishes a reason, but hides from us whether it is <lb/>
history or conjecture; it is because <i>"the babe had <lb/>
borne the journey well."</i> It has all the aspect of one <lb/>
of his artful devices&#x2014;flung in in his favorite casual <lb/>
way&#x2014;the way he has when he wants to draw one's <lb/>
attention away from an obvious thing and amuse it <lb/>
with some trifle that is less obvious but more useful <lb/>
&#x2014; in a history like this. The obvious thing is, that <lb/>
Harriet was happy because there was much territory <lb/>
between her husband and Cornelia Turner now; and <lb/>
because the perilous Italian lessons were taking a <lb/>
rest; and because, if there chanced to be any re- <lb/>
spondings like a tremulous instrument to every <lb/>
breath of passion or of sentiment in stock in these <lb/>
days, she might hope to get a share of them herself; <lb/>
and because, with her husband liberated, now, from <lb/>
the fetid fascinations of that sentimental retreat so <lb/>
pitilessly described by Hogg, who also dubbed it <lb/>
Shelley's paradise" later, she might hope to per- <lb/>
suade him to stay away from it permanently; and <lb/>
because she might also hope that his brain would <lb/>
cool, now, and his heart become healthy, and both <lb/>
brain and heart consider the situation and resolve <lb/>
that it would be a right and manly thing to stand by <lb/>
this girl-wife and her child and see that they were <lb/>
honorably dealt with, and cherished and protected <lb/>
and loved by the man that had promised these <lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
things, and so be made happy and kept so. And <lb/>
because, also&#x2014;may we conjecture this?&#x2014;we may <lb/>
hope for the privilege of taking up our cozy Latin <lb/>
lessons again, that used to be so pleasant, and <lb/>
brought us so near together&#x2014;so near, indeed, that <lb/>
often our heads touched, just as heads do over <lb/>
Italian lessons; and our hands met in casual and <lb/>
unintentional, but still most delicious and thrilling <lb/>
little contacts and momentary clasps, just as they <lb/>
inevitably do over Italian lessons. Suppose one <lb/>
should say to any young wife: "I find that your <lb/>
husband is poring over the Italian poets and being <lb/>
instructed in the beautiful Italian language by the <lb/>
lovely Cornelia Robinson"&#x2014;would that cozy pic- <lb/>
ture fail to rise before her mind? would its possi- <lb/>
bilities fail to suggest themselves to her? would <lb/>
there be a pang in her heart and a blush on her <lb/>
face? or, on the contrary, would the remark give <lb/>
her pleasure, make her joyous and gay? Why, one <lb/>
needs only to make the experiment&#x2014;the result will <lb/>
not be uncertain.</p>
<p>However, we learn&#x2014;by authority of deeply rea- <lb/>
soned and searching conjecture&#x2014;that the baby bore <lb/>
the journey well, and that that was why the young <lb/>
wife was happy. That accounts for two per cent, <lb/>
of the happiness, but it was not right to imply that <lb/>
it accounted for the other ninety-eight also.</p>
<p>Peacock, a scholar, poet, and friend of the Shel- <lb/>
leys, was of their party when they went away. He <lb/>
used to laugh at the Boinville menagerie, and "was <lb/>
<pb n="33"/>
not a favorite." One of the Boinville group, writing <lb/>
to Hogg, said, "The Shelleys have made an addi- <lb/>
tion to their party in the person of a cold scholar, <lb/>
who, I think, has neither taste nor feeling. This, <lb/>
Shelley will perceive sooner or later, for his warm <lb/>
nature craves sympathy." True, and Shelley will <lb/>
fight his way back there to get it&#x2014;there will be no <lb/>
way to head him off.</p>
<p>Towards the end of November it was necessary <lb/>
for Shelley to pay a business visit to London, and <lb/>
he conceived the project of leaving Harriet and the <lb/>
baby in Edinburgh with Harriets sister, Eliza West- <lb/>
brook, a sensible, practical maiden lady about thirty <lb/>
years old, who had spent a great part of her time <lb/>
with the family since the marriage. She was an <lb/>
estimable woman, and Shelley had had reason to <lb/>
like her, and did like her; but along about this time <lb/>
his feeling towards her changed. Part of Shelley's <lb/>
plan, as he wrote Hogg, was to spend his London <lb/>
evenings with the Newtons&#x2014;members of the Boin- <lb/>
ville Hysterical Society. But, alas, when he arrived <lb/>
early in December, that pleasant game was partially <lb/>
blocked, for Eliza and the family arrived <i>with</i> him. <lb/>
We are left destitute of conjectures at this point by <lb/>
the biographer, and it is my duty to supply one. <lb/>
I chance the conjecture that it was Eliza who inter- <lb/>
fered with that game. I think she tried to do what <lb/>
she could towards modifying the Boinville connec- <lb/>
tion, in the interest of her young sister's peace and <lb/>
honor.</p>
<pb n="34"/>
<p>If it was she who blocked that game, she was not <lb/>
strong enough to block the next one. Before the <lb/>
month and year were out&#x2014;no date given, let us <lb/>
call it Christmas&#x2014;Shelley and family were nested <lb/>
in a furnished house in Windsor, "at no great dis- <lb/>
tance from the Boinvilles"&#x2014;these decoys still re- <lb/>
siding at Bracknell.</p>
<p>What we need, now, is a misleading conjecture. <lb/>
We get it with characteristic promptness and de- <lb/>
pravity: <lb/>
<q>"But Prince Athanase found not the aged Zonoras, the friend of his <lb/>
boyhood, in any wanderings to Windsor. Dr. Lind had died a year <lb/>
since, and with his death Windsor must have lost, for Shelley, its chief <lb/>
attraction."</q></p>
<p>Still, not to mention Shelley's wife, there was <lb/>
Bracknell, at any rate. While Bracknell remains, <lb/>
all solace is not lost. Shelley is represented by this <lb/>
biographer as doing a great many careless things, <lb/>
but to my mind this hiring a furnished house for <lb/>
three months in order to be with a man who has <lb/>
been dead a year, is the carelessest of them all. <lb/>
One feels for him&#x2014;that is but natural, and does <lb/>
as honor besides&#x2014;yet one is vexed, for all that. <lb/>
He could have written and asked about the aged <lb/>
Zonoras before taking the house. He may not have <lb/>
had the address, but that is nothing&#x2014;any postman <lb/>
would know the aged Zonoras; a dead postman <lb/>
would remember a name like that.</p>
<p>And yet, why throw a rag like this to us ravening <lb/>
wolves? Is it seriously supposable that we will stop <lb/>
<pb n="35"/>
to chew it and let our prey escape? No, we are <lb/>
getting to expect this kind of device, and to give it <lb/>
merely a sniff for certainty's sake and then walk <lb/>
around it and leave it lying. Shelley was not after <lb/>
the aged Zonoras; he was pointed for Cornelia and <lb/>
the Italian lessons, for his warm nature was craving <lb/>
sympathy.</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> year 1813 is just ended now, and we step <lb/>
into 1814.</p>
<p>To recapitulate, how much of Cornelia's society <lb/>
has Shelley had, thus far? Portions of August and <lb/>
September, and four days of July. That is to say, <lb/>
he has had opportunity to enjoy it, more or less, <lb/>
during that brief period. Did he want some more <lb/>
of it? We must fall back upon history, and then <lb/>
go to conjecturing.</p>
<q>"In the early part of the year 1814, Shelley was a frequent visitor at <lb/>
Bracknell."</q>
<p>"Frequent" is a cautious word, in this author's <lb/>
mouth; the very cautiousness of it, the vagueness of <lb/>
it, provokes suspicion; it makes one suspect that <lb/>
this frequency was more frequent than the mere <lb/>
common everyday kinds of frequency which one is <lb/>
in the habit of averaging up with the unassuming <lb/>
term "frequent." I think so because they fixed <lb/>
up a bedroom for him in the Boinville house. One <lb/>
<pb n="36"/>
doesn't need a bedroom if one is only going to run <lb/>
over now and then in a disconnected way to respond <lb/>
like a tremulous instrument to every breath of pas- <lb/>
sion or of sentiment and rub up one's Italian poetry <lb/>
a little.</p>
<p>The young wife was not invited, perhaps. If she <lb/>
was, she most certainly did not come, or she would <lb/>
have straightened the room up; the most ignorant <lb/>
of us knows that a wife would not endure a room in <lb/>
the condition in which Hogg found this one when <lb/>
he occupied it one night. Shelley was away&#x2014;why, <lb/>
nobody can divine. Clothes were scattered about, <lb/>
there were books on every side: "Wherever a <lb/>
book could be laid was an open book turned down <lb/>
on its face to keep its place." It seems plain that <lb/>
the wife was not invited. No, not that; I think she <lb/>
was invited, but said to herself that she could not <lb/>
bear to go there and see another young woman <lb/>
touching heads with her husband over an Italian <lb/>
book and making thrilling hand-contacts with him <lb/>
accidentally.</p>
<p>As remarked, he was a frequent visitor there, <lb/>
"where he found an easeful resting-place in the <lb/>
house of Mrs. Boinville&#x2014;the white-haired Maimuna <lb/>
&#x2014; and of her daughter, Mrs. Turner." The aged <lb/>
Zonoras was deceased, but the white-haired Maimuna <lb/>
was still on deck, as we see. "Three charming <lb/>
ladies entertained the mocker (Hogg) with cups of <lb/>
tea, late hours, Wieland's Agathon, sighs and smiles, <lb/>
and the celestial manna of refined sentiment." <lb/>
<pb n="37"/>
"Such," says Hogg, "were the delights of Shel- <lb/>
ley's paradise in Bracknell."</p>
<p>The white-haired Maimuna presently writes to <lb/>
Hogg: <lb/>
<q>"I will not have you despise home-spun pleasures. Shelley is <lb/>
making a trial of them with us&#x2014;"</q></p>
<p>A trial of them. It may be called that. It was <lb/>
March 11, and he had been in the house a month. <lb/>
She continues: <lb/>
<q>Shelley "likes them so well that he is resolved to leave off ram- <lb/>
bling&#x2014;"</q></p>
<p>But he has <i>already</i> left it off. He has been there <lb/>
a month.</p>
<q>"And begin a course of them himself."</q>
<p>But he has already begun it. He has been at it a <lb/>
<i>month.</i> He likes it so well that he has forgotten all <lb/>
about his wife, as a letter of his reveals.</p>
<q>"Seriously, I think his mind and body want rest."</q>
<p>Yet he has been resting both for a month, with <lb/>
Italian, and tea, and manna of sentiment, and late <lb/>
hours, and every restful thing a young husband <lb/>
could need for the refreshment of weary limbs and a <lb/>
sore conscience, and a nagging sense of shabbiness <lb/>
and treachery.</p>
<q>"His journeys after what he has never found have racked his purse <lb/>
and his tranquillity. He is resolved to take a little care of the former, <lb/>
in pity to the latter, which I applaud, and shall second with all my <lb/>
might."</q>
<p>But she does not say whether the young wife, a <lb/>
<pb n="38"/>
stranger and lonely yonder, wants another woman <lb/>
and her daughter Cornelia to be lavishing so much <lb/>
inflamed interest on her husband or not. That <lb/>
young wife is always silent&#x2014;we are never allowed <lb/>
to hear from her. She must have opinions about <lb/>
such things, she cannot be indifferent, she must be <lb/>
approving or disapproving, surely she would speak <lb/>
if she were allowed&#x2014;even to-day and from her <lb/>
grave she would, if she could, I think&#x2014;but we <lb/>
get only the other side, they keep her silent always.</p>
<q>"He has deeply interested us. In the course of your intimacy he <lb/>
must have made you feel what we now feel for him. He is seeking a <lb/>
house close to us&#x2014;"</q>
<p>Ah! he is not close enough yet, it seems&#x2014; <lb/>
<q>"and if he succeeds we shall have an additional motive to induce you <lb/>
to come among us in the summer."</q></p>
<p>The reader would puzzle a long time and not <lb/>
guess the biographer's comment upon the above <lb/>
letter. It is this: <lb/>
<q>"These sound like words of a considerate and judicious friend."</q></p>
<p>That is what he thinks. That is, it is what he <lb/>
thinks he thinks. No, that is not quite it: it is what <lb/>
he thinks he can stupefy a particularly and unspeak- <lb/>
ably dull reader into thinking it is what he thinks. <lb/>
He makes that comment with the knowledge that <lb/>
Shelley is in love with this woman's daughter, and <lb/>
that it is because of the fascinations of these two <lb/>
that Shelley has deserted his wife&#x2014;for this month, <lb/>
considering all the circumstances, and his new pas- <lb/>
<pb n="39"/>
sion, and his employment of the time, amounted to <lb/>
desertion; that is its rightful name. We cannot <lb/>
know how the wife regarded it and felt about it; <lb/>
but if she could have read the letter which Shelley <lb/>
was writing to Hogg four or five days later, we <lb/>
could guess her thought and how she felt. Hear <lb/>
him: <lb/>
<q>"I have been staying with Mrs. Boinville for the last month; I have <lb/>
escaped, in the society of all that philosophy and friendship combine, <lb/>
from the dismaying solitude of myself."</q></p>
<p>It is fair to conjecture that he was feeling ashamed.</p>
<q>"They have revived in my heart the expiring flame of life. I have <lb/>
felt myself translated to a paradise which has nothing of mortality but <lb/>
its transitoriness; my heart sickens at the view of that necessity which <lb/>
will quickly divide me from the delightful tranquillity of this happy <lb/>
home&#x2014;for it has become my home.</q>
<q>"Eliza is still with us&#x2014;not here!&#x2014;but will be with me when the <lb/>
infinite malice of destiny forces me to depart."</q>
<p>Eliza is she who blocked that game&#x2014;the game <lb/>
in London&#x2014;the one where we were purposing to <lb/>
dine every night with one of the "three charming <lb/>
ladies' who fed tea and manna and late hours to <lb/>
Hogg at Bracknell.</p>
<p>Shelley could send Eliza away, of course; could <lb/>
have cleared her out long ago if so minded, just <lb/>
as he had previously done with a predecessor of <lb/>
hers whom he had first worshipped and then turned <lb/>
against; but perhaps she was useful there as a thin <lb/>
excuse for staying away himself.</p>
<pb n="40"/>
<q>"I am now but little inclined to contest this point. I certainly hate <lb/>
her with all my heart and soul.&#x2026;</q>
<q>"It is a sight which awakens an inexpressible sensation of disgust <lb/>
and horror, to see her caress my poor little Ianthe, in whom I may <lb/>
hereafter find the consolation of sympathy. I sometimes feel faint <lb/>
with the fatigue of checking the overflowings of my unbounded ab- <lb/>
horrence for this miserable wretch. But she is no more than a blind <lb/>
and loathsome worm, that cannot see to sting.</q>
<q>"I have begun to learn Italian again.&#x2026; Cornelia assists me in <lb/>
this language. Did I not once tell you that I thought her cold and re- <lb/>
served? She is the reverse of this, as she is the reverse of everything <lb/>
bad. She inherits all the divinity of her mother. &#x2026; I have some- <lb/>
times forgotten that I am not an inmate of this delightful home&#x2014;that a <lb/>
time will come which will cast me again into the boundless ocean of <lb/>
abhorred society.</q>
<q>"I have written nothing but one stanza, which has no meaning, and <lb/>
that I have only written in thought:</q>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Thy dewy looks sink in my breast;</l>
<l rend="indent">Thy gentle words stir poison there;</l>
<l>Thou hast disturbed the only rest</l>
<l rend="indent">That was the portion of despair.</l>
<l>Subdued to duty's hard control,</l>
<l rend="indent">I could have borne my wayward lot:</l>
<l>The chains that bind this ruined soul</l>
<l rend="indent">Had cankered then, but crushed it not.</l>
</lg></q>
<q>"This is the vision of a delirious and distempered dream, which <lb/>
passes away at the cold clear light of morning. Its surpassing excel- <lb/>
lence and exquisite perfections have no more reality than the color of an <lb/>
autumnal sunset."</q>
<p>Then it did not refer to his wife. That is plain; <lb/>
otherwise he would have said so. It is well that he <lb/>
explained that it has no meaning, for if he had not <lb/>
done that, the previous soft references to Cornelia <lb/>
and the way he has come to feel about her now <lb/>
would make us think she was the person who had <lb/>
<pb n="41"/>
inspired it while teaching him how to read the warm <lb/>
and ruddy Italian poets during a month.</p>
<p>The biography observes that portions of this letter <lb/>
"read like the tired moaning of a wounded crea- <lb/>
ture." Guesses at the nature of the wound are <lb/>
permissible; we will hazard one.</p>
<p>Read by the light of Shelley's previous history, <lb/>
his letter seems to be the cry of a tortured con- <lb/>
science. Until this time it was a conscience that <lb/>
had never felt a pang or known a smirch. It was <lb/>
the conscience of one who, until this time, had never <lb/>
done a dishonorable thing, or an ungenerous, or <lb/>
cruel, or treacherous thing, but was now doing all <lb/>
of these, and was keenly aware of it. Up to this <lb/>
time Shelley had been master of his nature, and it <lb/>
was a nature which was as beautiful and as nearly <lb/>
perfect as any merely human nature may be. But <lb/>
he was drunk now, with a debasing passion, and <lb/>
was not himself. There is nothing in his previous <lb/>
history that is in character with the Shelley of this <lb/>
letter. He had done boyish things, foolish things, <lb/>
even crazy things, but never a thing to be ashamed <lb/>
of. He had done things which one might laugh at, <lb/>
but the privilege of laughing was limited always to <lb/>
the thing itself; you could not laugh at the motive <lb/>
back of it&#x2014;that was high, that was noble. His <lb/>
most fantastic and quixotic acts had a purpose back <lb/>
of them which made them fine, often great, and <lb/>
made the rising laugh seem profanation and quenched <lb/>
it; quenched it, and changed the impulse to homage. <lb/>
<pb n="42"/>
Up to this time he had been loyalty itself, where his <lb/>
obligations lay&#x2014;treachery was new to him; he had <lb/>
never done an ignoble thing&#x2014;baseness was new to <lb/>
him; he had never done an unkind thing&#x2014;that <lb/>
also was new to him.</p>
<p>This was the author of that letter, this was the <lb/>
man who had deserted his young wife and was <lb/>
lamenting, bcause he must leave another woman's <lb/>
house which had become a "home" to him, and go <lb/>
away. Is he lamenting <i>mainly</i> because he must go <lb/>
back to his wife and child? No, the lament is <lb/>
mainly for what he is to leave behind him. The <lb/>
physical comforts of the house? No, in his life he <lb/>
had never attached importance to such things. <lb/>
Then the thing which he grieves to leave is narrowed <lb/>
down to a person&#x2014;to the person whose "dewy <lb/>
looks" had sunk into his breast, and whose seducing <lb/>
words had "stirred poison there."</p>
<p>He was ashamed of himself, his conscience was <lb/>
upbraiding him. He was the slave of a degrading <lb/>
love; he was drunk with his passion, the real Shel- <lb/>
ley was in temporary eclipse. This is the verdict <lb/>
which his previous history must certainly deliver <lb/>
upon this episode, I think.</p>
<p>One must be allowed to assist himself with conject- <lb/>
ures like these when trying to find his way through <lb/>
a literary swamp which has so many misleading <lb/>
finger-boards up as this book is furnished with.</p>
<p>We have now arrived at a part of the swamp <lb/>
where the difficulties and perplexities are going to <lb/>
<pb n="43"/>
be greater than any we have yet met with&#x2014;where, <lb/>
indeed, the finger-boards are multitudinous, and the <lb/>
most of them pointing diligently in the wrong direc- <lb/>
tion. We are to be told by the biography why <lb/>
Shelley deserted his wife and child and took up with <lb/>
Cornelia Turner and Italian. It was not on account <lb/>
of Cornelia's sighs and sentimentalities and tea and <lb/>
manna and late hours and soft and sweet and indus- <lb/>
trious enticements; no, it was because "his happi- <lb/>
ness in his home had been wounded and bruised <lb/>
almost to death."</p>
<p>It had been wounded and bruised almost to death <lb/>
in this way:</p>
<list>
<item>1st. Harriet persuaded him to set up a carriage.</item>
<item>2d. After the intrusion of the baby, Harriet <lb/>
stopped reading aloud and studying.</item>
<item>3d. Harriet's walks with Hogg "commonly con- <lb/>
ducted us to some fashionable bonnet-shop."</item>
<item>4th. Harriet hired a wet-nurse.</item>
<item>5th. When an operation was being performed <lb/>
upon the baby, "Harriet stood by, narrowly ob- <lb/>
serving all that was done, but, to the astonishment <lb/>
of the operator, betraying not the smallest sign of <lb/>
emotion."</item>
<item>6th. Eliza Westbrook, sister-in-law, was still of <lb/>
the household.</item>
</list>
<p>The evidence against Harriet Shelley is all in; <lb/>
there is no more. Upon these six counts she stands <lb/>
indicted of the crime of driving her husband into <lb/>
that sty at Bracknell; and this crime, by these helps, <lb/>
<pb n="44"/>
the biographical prosecuting attorney has set himself <lb/>
the task of proving upon her.</p>
<p>Does the biographer <i>call</i> himself the attorney for <lb/>
the prosecution? No, only to himself, privately; <lb/>
publicly he is the passionless, disinterested, impartial <lb/>
judge on the bench. He holds up his judicial scales <lb/>
before the world, that all may see; and it all tries <lb/>
to look so fair that a blind person would sometimes <lb/>
fail to see him slip the false weights in.</p>
<p>Shelley's happiness in his home had been wounded <lb/>
and bruised almost to death, first, because Harriet <lb/>
had persuaded him to set up a carriage. I cannot <lb/>
discover that any evidence is offered that she asked <lb/>
him to set up a carriage. Still, if she did, was it <lb/>
a heavy offence? Was it unique? Other young wives <lb/>
had committed it before, others have committed it <lb/>
since. Shelley had dearly loved her in those Lon- <lb/>
don days; possibly he set up the carriage gladly to <lb/>
please her; affectionate young husbands do such <lb/>
things. When Shelley ran away with another girl, <lb/>
by-and-by, this girl persuaded him to pour the price <lb/>
of many carriages and many horses down the <lb/>
bottomless well of her father's debts, but this im- <lb/>
partial judge finds no fault with that. Once she <lb/>
appeals to Shelley to raise money&#x2014;necessarily by <lb/>
borrowing, there was no other way&#x2014;to pay her <lb/>
father's debts with at a time when Shelley was in <lb/>
danger of being arrested and imprisoned for his own <lb/>
debts; yet the good judge finds no fault with her <lb/>
even for this.</p>
<pb n="45"/>
<p>First and last, Shelley emptied into that rapacious <lb/>
mendicant's lap a sum which cost him&#x2014;for he <lb/>
borrowed it at ruinous rates&#x2014;from eighty to one <lb/>
hundred thousand dollars. But it was Mary God- <lb/>
win's papa, the supplications were often sent through <lb/>
Mary, the good judge is Mary's strenuous friend, so <lb/>
Mary gets no censures. On the Continent <i>Mary <lb/>
rode in her private carriage,</i> built, as Shelley boasts, <lb/>
"by one of the best makers in Bond Street," yet <lb/>
the good judge makes not even a passing comment <lb/>
on this iniquity. Let us throw out Count No. 1 <lb/>
against Harriet Shelley as being far-fetched and <lb/>
frivolous.</p>
<p>Shelley's happiness in his home had been wounded <lb/>
and bruised almost to death, secondly, because Har- <lb/>
riet's studies "had dwindled away to nothing, <lb/>
Bysshe had ceased to express any interest in them." <lb/>
At what time was this? It was when Harriet "had <lb/>
fully recovered from the fatigue of her first effort of <lb/>
maternity,&#x2026; and was now in full force, vigor, <lb/>
and effect." Very well, the baby was born two <lb/>
days before the close of June. It took the mother <lb/>
a month to get back her full force, vigor, and effect; <lb/>
this brings us to July 27th and the deadly Cornelia. <lb/>
If a wife of eighteen is studying with her husband <lb/>
and he gets smitten with another woman, isn't he <lb/>
likely to lose interest in his wife's studies for <i>that</i>
reason, and is not his wife's interest in her studies <lb/>
likely to languish for the <i>same</i> reason? Would not <lb/>
the mere sight of those books of hers sharpen the <lb/>
<pb n="46"/>
pain that is in her heart? This sudden breaking <lb/>
down of a mutual intellectual interest of two years' <lb/>
standing is coincident with Shelley's re-encounter <lb/>
with Cornelia; and we are allowed to gather from <lb/>
that time forth for nearly two months he did all his <lb/>
studying in that person's society. We feel at <lb/>
liberty to rule out Count No. 2 from the indictment <lb/>
against Harriet.</p>
<p>Shelley's happiness in his home had been wounded <lb/>
and bruised almost to death, thirdly, because Har- <lb/>
riet's walks with Hogg commonly led to some <lb/>
fashionable bonnet-shop. I offer no palliation; I <lb/>
only ask why the dispassionate, impartial judge did <lb/>
not offer one himself&#x2014; merely, I mean, to offset his <lb/>
leniency in a similar case or two where the girl who <lb/>
ran away with Harriet's husband was the shopper. <lb/>
There are several occasions where she interested <lb/>
herself with shopping&#x2014;among them being walks <lb/>
which ended at the bonnet-shop&#x2014;yet in none of <lb/>
these cases does she get a word of blame from the <lb/>
good judge, while in one of them he covers the deed <lb/>
with a justifying remark, she doing the shopping <lb/>
that time to find easement for her mind, her child <lb/>
having died.</p>
<p>Shelley's happiness in his home had been wounded <lb/>
and bruised almost to death, fourthly, by the intro- <lb/>
duction there of a wet-nurse. The wet-nurse was <lb/>
introduced at the time of the Edinburgh sojourn, <lb/>
immediately after Shelley had been enjoying the two <lb/>
months of study with Cornelia which broke up his <lb/>
<pb n="47"/>
wife's studies and destroyed his personal interest in <lb/>
them. Why, by this time, nothing that Shelley's <lb/>
wife could do would have been satisfactory to him, <lb/>
for he was in love with another woman, and was <lb/>
never going to be contented again until he got back <lb/>
to her. If he had been still in love with his wife it <lb/>
is not easily conceivable that he would care much <lb/>
who nursed the baby, provided the baby was well <lb/>
nursed. Harriet's jealousy was assuredly voicing <lb/>
itself now, Shelley's conscience was assuredly nag- <lb/>
ging him, pestering him, persecuting him. Shelley <lb/>
needed excuses for his altered attitude towards his <lb/>
wife; Providence pitied him and sent the wet-nurse. <lb/>
If Providence had sent him a cotton doughnut it <lb/>
would have answered just as well; all he wanted <lb/>
was something to find fault with.</p>
<p>Shelley's happiness in his home had been wounded <lb/>
and bruised almost to death, fifthly, because Harriet <lb/>
narrowly watched a surgical operation which was <lb/>
being performed upon her child, and, "to the <lb/>
astonishment of the operator," who was watching <lb/>
Harriet instead of attending to his operation, she <lb/>
betrayed "not the smallest sign of emotion." The <lb/>
author of this biography was not ashamed to set <lb/>
down that exultant slander. He was apparently not <lb/>
aware that it was a small business to bring into his <lb/>
court a witness whose name he does not know, and <lb/>
whose character and veracity there is none to <lb/>
vouch for, and allow him to strike this blow at the <lb/>
mother-heart of this friendless girl. The biographer <lb/>
<pb n="48"/>
says, "We may not infer from this that Harriet did <lb/>
not feel "&#x2014; why put it in, then? &#x2014;" but we learn <lb/>
that those about her could believe her to be hard <lb/>
and insensible." Who were those who were about <lb/>
her? Her husband? He hated her now, because he <lb/>
was in love elsewhere. Her sister? Of course that <lb/>
is not charged. Peacock? Peacock does not testify. <lb/>
The wet-nurse? She does not testify. If any others <lb/>
were there we have no mention of them. "Those <lb/>
about her" are reduced to one person&#x2014;her hus- <lb/>
band. Who reports the circumstance? It is Hogg. <lb/>
Perhaps he was there&#x2014;we do not know. But if he <lb/>
was, he still got his information at second-hand, as <lb/>
it was the operator who noticed Harriet's lack of <lb/>
emotion, not himself. Hogg is not given to saying <lb/>
kind things when Harriet is his subject. He may <lb/>
have said them the time that he tried to tempt her <lb/>
to soil her honor, but after that he mentions her <lb/>
usually with a sneer. "Among those who were <lb/>
about her" was one witness well equipped to <lb/>
silence all tongues, abolish all doubts, set our minds at <lb/>
rest; one witness, not called, and not callable, whose <lb/>
evidence, if we could but get it, would outweigh <lb/>
the oaths of whole battalions of hostile Hoggs and <lb/>
nameless surgeons&#x2014;the baby. I wish we had the <lb/>
baby's testimony; and yet if we had it it would not <lb/>
do us any good&#x2014;a furtive conjecture, a sly insinua- <lb/>
tion, a pious "if" or two, would be smuggled in, <lb/>
here and there, with a solemn air of judicial investi- <lb/>
gation, and its positiveness would wilt into dubiety.</p>
<pb n="49"/>
<p>The biographer says of Harriet, "If words of <lb/>
tender affection and motherly pride proved the <lb/>
reality of love, then undoubtedly she loved her first- <lb/>
born child." That is, if mere empty words can <lb/>
prove it, it stands proved&#x2014;and in this way, with- <lb/>
out committing himself, he gives the reader a chance <lb/>
to infer that there isn't any extant evidence but <lb/>
words, and that he doesn't take much stock in them. <lb/>
How seldom he shows his hand! He is always lurk- <lb/>
ing behind a non-committal "if" or something of <lb/>
that kind; always gliding and dodging around, dis- <lb/>
tributing colorless poison here and there and every- <lb/>
where, but always leaving himself in a position to <lb/>
say that his language will be found innocuous if <lb/>
taken to pieces and examined. He clearly exhibits <lb/>
a steady and never-relaxing purpose to make Harriet <lb/>
the scapegoat for her husband's first great sin&#x2014;but <lb/>
it is in the general view that this is revealed, not in <lb/>
the details. His insidious literature is like blue <lb/>
water; you know what it is that makes it blue, but <lb/>
you cannot produce and verify any detail of the <lb/>
cloud of microscopic dust in it that does it. Your <lb/>
adversary can dip up a glassful and show you that <lb/>
it is pure white and you cannot deny it; and he can <lb/>
dip the lake dry, glass by glass, and show that <lb/>
every glassful is white, and prove it to any one's <lb/>
eye&#x2014;and yet that lake <i>was</i> blue and you can swear <lb/>
it. This book is blue&#x2014;with slander in solution.</p>
<p>Let the reader examine, for example, the para- <lb/>
graph of comment which immediately follows the
<pb n="50"/>
letter containing Shelley's self-exposure which we <lb/>
have been considering. This is it. One should in- <lb/>
spect the individual sentences as they go by, then <lb/>
pass them in procession and review the cake-walk as <lb/>
a whole: <lb/>
<q>"Shelley's happiness in his home, as is evident from this pathetic <lb/>
letter, had been fatally stricken; it is evident, also, that he knew where <lb/>
duty lay; he felt that his part was to take up his burden, silently and <lb/>
sorrowfully, and to bear it henceforth with the quietness of despair. <lb/>
But we can perceive that he scarcely possessed the strength and fortitude <lb/>
needful for success in such an attempt. And clearly Shelley himself was <lb/>
aware how perilous it was to accept that respite of blissful ease which <lb/>
he enjoyed in the Boinville household; for gentle voices and dewy looks <lb/>
and words of sympathy could not fail to remind him of an ideal of <lb/>
tranquillity or of joy which could never be his, and which he must <lb/>
henceforth sternly exclude from his imagination."</q></p>
<p>That paragraph commits the author in no way. <lb/>
Taken sentence by sentence it <i>asserts</i> nothing against <lb/>
anybody or in favor of anybody, pleads for nobody, <lb/>
accuses nobody. Taken detail by detail, it is as <lb/>
innocent as moonshine. And yet, taken as a whole, <lb/>
it is a design against the reader; its intent is to re- <lb/>
move the feeling which the letter must leave with <lb/>
him if let alone, and put a different one in its place <lb/>
&#x2014; to remove a feeling justified by the letter and <lb/>
substitute one not justified by it. The letter itself <lb/>
gives you no uncertain picture&#x2014;no lecturer is <lb/>
needed to stand by with a stick and point out its <lb/>
details and let on to explain what they mean. The <lb/>
picture is the very clear and remorsefully faithful <lb/>
picture of a fallen and fettered angel who is ashamed <lb/>
of himself; an angel who beats his soiled wings and <lb/>
<pb n="51"/>
cries, who complains to the woman who enticed him <lb/>
that he <i>could</i> have borne his wayward lot, he <i>could</i> <lb/>
have stood by his duty if it had not been for her <lb/>
beguilements; an angel who rails at the "boundless <lb/>
ocean of abhorred society" and rages at his poor <lb/>
judicious sister-in-law. If there is any dignity about <lb/>
this spectacle it will escape most people.</p>
<p>Yet when the paragraph of comment is taken as a <lb/>
whole, the picture is full of dignity and pathos; we <lb/>
have before us a blameless and noble spirit stricken <lb/>
to the earth by malign powers, but not conquered; <lb/>
tempted, but grandly putting the temptation away; <lb/>
enmeshed by subtle coils, but sternly resolved to <lb/>
rend them and march forth victorious, at any peril <lb/>
of life or limb. Curtain&#x2014;slow music.</p>
<p>Was it the purpose of the paragraph to take the <lb/>
bad taste of Shelley's letter out of the reader's <lb/>
mouth? If that was not it, good ink was wasted; <lb/>
without that, it has no relevancy&#x2014;the multiplica- <lb/>
tion table would have padded the space as rationally.</p>
<p>We have inspected the six reasons which we are <lb/>
asked to believe drove a man of conspicuous <lb/>
patience, honor, justice, fairness, kindliness, and <lb/>
iron firmness, resolution, and steadfastness, from <lb/>
the wife whom he loved and who loved him, to a <lb/>
refuge in the mephitic paradise of Bracknell. These <lb/>
are six infinitely little reasons; but there were six <lb/>
colossal ones, and these the counsel for the destruc- <lb/>
tion of Harriet Shelley persists in not considering <lb/>
very important.</p>
<pb n="52"/>
<p>Moreover, the colossal six preceded the little six, <lb/>
and had done the mischief before they were born. <lb/>
Let us double-column the twelve; then we shall see <lb/>
at a glance that each little reason is in turn answered <lb/>
by a retorting reason of a size to overshadow it and <lb/>
make it insignificant:</p>

<p>As soon as we comprehend that Cornelia Turner <lb/>
and the Italian lessons happened <i>before</i> the little six <lb/>
had been discovered to be grievances, we understand <lb/>
why Shelley's happiness in his home had been <lb/>
wounded and bruised almost to death, and no one <lb/>
can persuade us into laying it on Harriet. Shelley <lb/>
and Cornelia are the responsible persons, and we <lb/>
cannot in honor and decency allow the cruelties <lb/>
which they practised upon the unoffending wife to <lb/>
be pushed aside in order to give us a chance to waste <lb/>
time and tears over six sentimental justifications of <lb/>
an offence which the six can't justify, nor even re- <lb/>
spectably assist in justifying.</p>
<p>Six? There were seven; but in charity to the <lb/>
biographer the seventh ought not to be exposed. <lb/>
Still, he hung it out himself, and not only hung it <lb/>
out, but thought it was a good point in Shelley's <lb/>
favor. For two years Shelley found sympathy and <lb/>
intellectual food and all that at home; there was <lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
enough for spiritual and mental support, but not <lb/>
enough for luxury; and so, at the end of the con- <lb/>
tented two years, this latter detail justifies him in <lb/>
going bag and baggage over to Cornelia Turner and <lb/>
supplying the rest of his need in the way of surplus <lb/>
sympathy and intellectual pie unlawfully. By the <lb/>
same reasoning a man in merely comfortable circum- <lb/>
stances may rob a bank without sin.</p>

<head>III</head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> is 1814, it is the 16th of March, Shelley has <lb/>
written his letter, he has been in the Boinville <lb/>
paradise a month, his deserted wife is in her hus- <lb/>
bandless home. Mischief had been wrought. It is <lb/>
the biographer who concedes this. We greatly need <lb/>
some light <i>on</i> Harriet's side of the case now; we <lb/>
need to know how she enjoyed the month, but there <lb/>
is no way to inform ourselves; there seems to be a <lb/>
strange absence of documents and letters and diaries <lb/>
on that side. Shelley kept a diary, the approaching <lb/>
Mary Godwin kept a diary, her father kept one, her <lb/>
half-sister by marriage, adoption, and the dispensa- <lb/>
tion of God kept one, and the entire tribe and all its <lb/>
friends wrote and received letters, and the letters <lb/>
were kept and are producible when this biography <lb/>
needs them; but there are only three or four scraps <lb/>
of Harriet's writing, and no diary. Harriet wrote <lb/>
plenty of letters to her husband&#x2014;nobody knows <lb/>
<pb n="54"/>
where they are, I suppose; she wrote plenty of <lb/>
letters to other people&#x2014;apparently they have dis- <lb/>
appeared, too. Peacock says she wrote good letters, <lb/>
but apparently interested people had sagacity enough <lb/>
to mislay them in time. After all her industry she <lb/>
went down into her grave and lies silent there&#x2014; <lb/>
silent, when she has so much need to speak. We <lb/>
can only wonder at this mystery, not account for it.</p>
<p>No, there is no way of finding out what Harriet's <lb/>
state of feeling was during the month that Shelley <lb/>
was disporting himself in the Bracknell paradise. <lb/>
We have to fall back upon conjecture, as our fabu- <lb/>
list does when he has nothing more substantial to <lb/>
work with. Then we easily conjecture that as the <lb/>
days dragged by Harriet's heart grew heavier and <lb/>
heavier under its two burdens&#x2014;shame and resent- <lb/>
ment: the shame of being pointed at and gossiped <lb/>
about as a deserted wife, and resentment against the <lb/>
woman who had beguiled her husband from her and <lb/>
now kept him in a disreputable captivity. Deserted <lb/>
wives&#x2014;deserted whether for cause or without cause <lb/>
&#x2014; find small charity among the virtuous and the dis- <lb/>
creet. We conjecture that one after another the <lb/>
neighbors ceased to call; that one after another <lb/>
they got to being "engaged "when Harriet called; <lb/>
that finally they one after the other cut her dead on <lb/>
the street; that after that she stayed in the house <lb/>
daytimes, and brooded over her sorrows, and night- <lb/>
times did the same, there being nothing else to do <lb/>
with the heavy hours and the silence and solitude <lb/>
<pb n="55"/>
and the dreary intervals which sleep should have <lb/>
charitably bridged, but didn't.</p>
<p>Yes, mischief had been wrought. The biographer <lb/>
arrives at this conclusion, and it is a most just one. <lb/>
Then, just as you begin to half hope he is going to <lb/>
discover the cause of it and launch hot bolts of <lb/>
wrath at the guilty manufacturers of it, you have to <lb/>
turn away disappointed. You are disappointed, and <lb/>
you sigh. This is what he says&#x2014;the italics are <lb/>
mine: <lb/>
<q>"However the mischief may have been wrought&#x2014;<i>and at this day</i> <lb/>
<i>no one can wish to heap blame on any buried head</i>&#x2014;"</q></p>
<p>So it is poor Harriet, after all. Stern justice must <lb/>
take its course&#x2014;justice tempered with delicacy, <lb/>
justice tempered with compassion, justice that pities <lb/>
a forlorn dead girl and refuses to strike her. Ex- <lb/>
cept in the back. Will not be ignoble and <i>say</i> the <lb/>
harsh thing, but only insinuate it. Stern justice <lb/>
knows about the carriage and the wet-nurse and the <lb/>
bonnet-shop and the other dark things that caused <lb/>
this sad mischief, and may not, <i>must</i> not blink them; <lb/>
so it delivers judgment where judgment belongs, but <lb/>
softens the blow by not seeming to deliver judgment <lb/>
at all. To resume&#x2014;the italics are mine: <lb/>
<q>"However the mischief may have been wrought&#x2014;and at this day <lb/>
no one can wish to heap blame on any buried head&#x2014;<i>it is certain that <lb/>
some cause or causes of deep division between Shelley and his wife were <lb/>
in operation during the early part of the year 1814."</i></q></p>
<p>This shows penetration. No deduction could be <lb/>
more accurate than this. There were indeed some <lb/>
<pb n="56"/>
causes of deep division. But next comes another <lb/>
disappointing sentence: <lb/>
<q>"To guess at the precise nature of these causes, in the absence of <lb/>
definite statement, were useless."</q></p>
<p>Why, he has already been guessing at them for <lb/>
several pages, and we have been trying to outguess <lb/>
him, and now all of a sudden he is tired of it and <lb/>
won't play any more. It is not quite fair to us. <lb/>
However, he will get over this by-and-by, when <lb/>
Shelley commits his next indiscretion and has to be <lb/>
guessed out of it at Harriet's expense.</p>
<p>"We may rest content with Shelley's own <lb/>
words"&#x2014;in a Chancery paper drawn up by him <lb/>
three years later. They were these: "Delicacy <lb/>
forbids me to say more than that we were disunited <lb/>
by incurable dissensions."</p>
<p>As for me, I do not quite see why we should rest <lb/>
content with anything of the sort. It is not a very <lb/>
definite statement. It does not necessarily mean <lb/>
anything more than that he did not wish to go into <lb/>
the tedious details of those family quarrels. Deli- <lb/>
cacy could quite properly excuse him from saying, <lb/>
"I was in love with Cornelia all that time; my wife <lb/>
kept crying and worrying about it and upbraiding <lb/>
me and begging me to cut myself free from a con- <lb/>
nection which was wronging her and disgracing us <lb/>
both; and I being stung by these reproaches re- <lb/>
torted with fierce and bitter speeches&#x2014;for it is my <lb/>
nature to do that when I am stirred, especially if <lb/>
the target of them is a person whom I had greatly <lb/>
<pb n="57"/>
loved and respected before, as witness my various <lb/>
attitudes towards Miss Hitchener, the Gisbornes, <lb/>
Harriet's sister, and others&#x2014;and finally I did not <lb/>
improve this state of things when I deserted my wife <lb/>
and spent a whole month with the woman who had <lb/>
infatuated me."</p>
<p>No, he could not go into those details, and we <lb/>
excuse him; but, nevertheless, we do not rest con- <lb/>
tent with this bland proposition to puff away that <lb/>
whole Jong disreputable episode with a single mean- <lb/>
ingless remark of Shelley's.</p>
<p>We do admit that "it is certain that some cause <lb/>
or causes of deep division were in operation.'' We <lb/>
would admit it just the same if the grammar of the <lb/>
statement were as straight as a string, for we drift <lb/>
into pretty indifferent grammar ourselves when we <lb/>
are absorbed in historical work; but we have to de- <lb/>
cline to admit that we cannot guess those cause or <lb/>
causes.</p>
<p>But guessing is not really necessary. There is <lb/>
evidence attainable&#x2014;evidence from the batch dis- <lb/>
credited by the biographer and set out at the back <lb/>
door in his appendix-basket; and yet a court of law <lb/>
would think twice before throwing it out, whereas it <lb/>
would be a hardy person who would venture to offer <lb/>
in such a place a good part of the material which is <lb/>
placed before the readers of this book as "evi- <lb/>
dence," and so treated by this daring biographer. <lb/>
Among some letters (in the appendix-basket) from <lb/>
Mrs. Godwin, detailing the Godwinian share in the <lb/>
<pb n="58"/>
Shelleyan events of 1814, she tells how Harriet <lb/>
Shelley came to her and her husband, agitated and <lb/>
weeping, to implore them to forbid Shelley the <lb/>
house, and prevent his seeing Mary Godwin.</p>
<q>"She related that last November he had fallen in love with Mrs. <lb/>
Turner and paid her such marked attentions Mr. Turner, the husband, <lb/>
had carried off his wife to Devonshire."</q>
<p>The biographer finds a technical fault in this; <lb/>
"the Shelleys were in <i>Edinburgh</i> in November." <lb/>
What of that? The woman is recalling a conversa- <lb/>
tion which is more than two months old; besides, <lb/>
she was probably more intent upon the central and <lb/>
important fact of it than upon its unimportant date. <lb/>
Harriet's quoted statement has some sense in it; for <lb/>
that reason, if for no other, it ought to have been <lb/>
put in the body of the book. Still, that would not <lb/>
have answered; even the biographer's enemy could <lb/>
not be cruel enough to ask him to let this real <lb/>
grievance, this compact and substantial and pictur- <lb/>
esque figure, this rawhead-and-bloody-bones, come <lb/>
striding in there among those pale shams, those <lb/>
rickety spectres labeled <smcap>Wet-Nurse, Bonnet-Shop,</smcap> <lb/>
and so on&#x2014;no, the father of all malice could not <lb/>
ask the biographer to expose his pathetic goblins to <lb/>
a competition like that.</p>
<p>The fabulist finds fault with the statement because <lb/>
it has a technical error in it; and he does this at the <lb/>
moment that he is furnishing us an error himself, <lb/>
and of a graver sort. He says: <lb/>
<q>"If Turner carried off his wife to Devonshire he brought her back, <lb/>
<pb n="59"/>
and Shelley was staying with her and her mother on terms of cordial <lb/>
intimacy in March, 1814."</q></p>
<p>We accept the "cordial intimacy" &#x2014;it was the <lb/>
very thing Harriet was complaining of&#x2014;but there <lb/>
is nothing to show that it was Turner who brought <lb/>
his wife back. The statement is thrown in as if it <lb/>
were not only true, but was proof that Turner was <lb/>
not uneasy. Turner's <i>movements</i> are proof of noth- <lb/>
ing. Nothing but a statement from Turner's mouth <lb/>
would have any value here, and he made none.</p>
<p>Six days after writing his letter Shelley and his <lb/>
wife were together again for a moment&#x2014;to get <lb/>
remarried according to the rites of the English <lb/>
Church.</p>
<p>Within three weeks the new husband and wife <lb/>
were apart again, and the former was back in his <lb/>
odorous paradise. This time it is the wife who does <lb/>
the deserting. She finds Cornelia too strong for <lb/>
her, probably. At any rate, she goes away with <lb/>
her baby and sister, and we have a playful fling at <lb/>
her from good Mrs. Boinville, the "mysterious <lb/>
spinner Maimuna "; she whose "face was as a <lb/>
damsel's face, and yet her hair was gray "; she of <lb/>
whom the biographer has said, "Shelley was indeed <lb/>
caught in an almost invisible thread spun around <lb/>
him, but unconsciously, by this subtle and benignant <lb/>
enchantress." The subtle and benignant enchant- <lb/>
ress writes to Hogg, April 18: "Shelley is again a <lb/>
widower; his beauteous half went to town on <lb/>
Thursday."</p>
<pb n="60"/>
<p>Then Shelley writes a poem&#x2014;a chant of grief <lb/>
over the hard fate which obliges him now to leave <lb/>
his paradise and take up with his wife again. It <lb/>
seems to intimate that the paradise is cooling towards <lb/>
him; that he is warned off by acclamation; that he <lb/>
must not even venture to tempt with one last tear <lb/>
his friend Cornelia's ungentle mood, for her eye is <lb/>
glazed and cold and dares not entreat her lover to <lb/>
stay: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<head><i>Exhibit E</i></head>
<l>"Pause not! the time is past! Every voice cries 'Away!'</l>
<l rend="indent">Tempt not with one last tear thy friend's ungentle mood;</l>
<l>Thy lover's eye, so glazed and cold, dares not entreat thy stay:</l>
<l rend="indent">Duty and dereliction guide thee back to solitude."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Back to the solitude of his now empty home, that <lb/>
is!</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Away! away! to thy sad and silent home;</l>
<l>Pour bitter tears on its desolated hearth."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>But he will have rest in the grave by-and-by. <lb/>
Until that time comes, the charms of Bracknell will <lb/>
remain in his memory, along with Mrs. Boinville's <lb/>
voice and Cornelia Turner's smile: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Thou in the grave shalt rest&#x2014;yet, till the phantoms flee</l>
<l rend="hang">"Which that house and hearth and garden made dear to thee ere- <lb/>
while,</l>
<l>Thy remembrance and repentance and deep musings are not free</l>
<l rend="indent">From the music of two voices and the light of one sweet smile."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>We <i>cannot</i> wonder that Harriet could not stand it. <lb/>
Any of us would have left. We would not even stay <lb/>
<pb n="61"/>
with a cat that was in this condition. Even the <lb/>
Boinvilles could not endure it; and so, as we have <lb/>
seen, they gave this one notice.</p>
<q>"Early in May, Shelley was in London. He did not yet despair of <lb/>
reconciliation with Harriet, nor had he ceased to love her."</q>
<p>Shelley's poems are a good deal of trouble to his <lb/>
biographer. They are constantly inserted as "evi- <lb/>
dence," and they make much confusion. As soon <lb/>
as one of them has proved one thing, another one <lb/>
follows and proves quite a different thing. The <lb/>
poem just quoted shows that he was in love with <lb/>
Cornelia, but a month later he is in love with Harriet <lb/>
again, and there is a poem to prove it.</p>
<q>"In this piteous appeal Shelley declares that he has now no grief but <lb/>
one&#x2014;the grief of having known and lost his wife's love."</q>
<q><lg type="group">
<head><i>Exhibit F</i></head>
<l>"Thy look of love has power to calm</l>
<l>The stormiest passion of my soul."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>But without doubt she had been reserving her <lb/>
looks of love a good part of the time for ten months, <lb/>
now?&#x2014; ever since he began to lavish his own on <lb/>
Cornelia Turner at the end of the previous July. <lb/>
He does really seem to have already forgotten Cor- <lb/>
nelia's merits in one brief month, for he eulogizes <lb/>
Harriet in a way which rules all competition out: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Thou only virtuous, gentle, kind,</l>
<l>Amid a world of hate."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>He complains of her hardness, and begs her to <lb/>
make the concession of a "slight endurance "&#x2014; of <lb/>
his waywardness, perhaps&#x2014;for the sake of "a <lb/>
<pb n="62"/>
fellow-being's lasting weal." But the main force of <lb/>
his appeal is in his closing stanza, and is strongly <lb/>
worded: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"O trust for once no erring guide!</l>
<l rend="indent">Bid the remorseless feeling flee;</l>
<l>'Tis malice, 'tis revenge, 'tis pride,</l>
<l rend="indent">'Tis anything but thee;</l>
<l>O deign a nobler pride to prove,</l>
<l>And pity if thou canst not love."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>This is in May&#x2014;apparently towards the end of <lb/>
it. Harriet and Shelley were corresponding all the <lb/>
time. Harriet got the poem&#x2014;a copy exists in her <lb/>
own handwriting; she being the only gentle and <lb/>
kind person amid a world of hate, according to <lb/>
Shelley's own testimony in the poem, we are per- <lb/>
mitted to think that the daily letters would presently <lb/>
have melted that kind and gentle heart and brought <lb/>
about the reconciliation, if there had been time&#x2014; <lb/>
but there wasn't; for in a very few days&#x2014;in fact, <lb/>
before the 8th of June&#x2014;Shelley was in love with <lb/>
<i>another</i> woman.</p>
<p>And so&#x2014;perhaps while Harriet was walking the <lb/>
floor nights, trying to get <i>her</i> poem by heart&#x2014;her <lb/>
husband was doing a fresh one&#x2014;for the other girl <lb/>
&#x2014; Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin&#x2014;with sentiments <lb/>
like these in it: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<head><i>Exhibit G</i></head>
<l>"To spend years thus and be rewarded,</l>
<l>As thou, sweet love, requited me</l>
<l>When none were near.</l>
<l>&#x2026; thy lips did meet</l>
<l>Mine tremblingly;&#x2026;,</l>
<pb n="63"/>
<l>"Gentle and good and mild thou art,</l>
<l rend="indent">Nor can I live if thou appear</l>
<l>Aught but thyself."&#x2026;</l>
</lg></q>
And so on. "Before the close of June it was known <lb/>
and felt by Mary and Shelley that each was inex- <lb/>
pressibly dear to the other." Yes, Shelley had <lb/>
found this child of sixteen to his liking, and had <lb/>
wooed and won her in the graveyard. But that is <lb/>
nothing; it was better than wooing her in her <lb/>
nursery, at any rate, where it might have disturbed <lb/>
the other children.</p>
<p>However, she was a child in years only. From <lb/>
the day that she set her masculine grip on Shelley <lb/>
he was to frisk no more. If she had occupied the <lb/>
only kind and gentle Harriet's place in March it <lb/>
would have been a thrilling spectacle to see her in- <lb/>
vade the Boinville rookery and read the riot act. <lb/>
That holiday of Shelley's would have been of short <lb/>
duration, and Cornelia's hair would have been as <lb/>
gray as her mother's when the services were over.</p>
<p>Hogg went to the Godwin residence in Skinner <lb/>
Street with Shelley on that 8th of June. They <lb/>
passed through Godwin's little debt-factory of a <lb/>
book-shop and went up-stairs hunting for the pro- <lb/>
prietor. Nobody there. Shelley strode about the <lb/>
room impatiently, making its crazy floor quake under <lb/>
him. Then a door "was partially and softly opened. <lb/>
A thrilling voice called 'Shelley!' A thrilling voice <lb/>
answered, 'Mary!' And he darted out of the room <lb/>
like an arrow from the bow of the far-shooting King. <lb/>
<pb n="64"/>
A very young female, fair and fair-haired, pale, <lb/>
indeed, and with a piercing look, wearing a frock of <lb/>
tartan, an unusual dress in London at that time, had <lb/>
called him out of the room."</p>
<p>This is Mary Godwin, as described by Hogg. <lb/>
The thrill of the voices shows that the love of <lb/>
Shelley and Mary was already upward of a fortnight <lb/>
old; therefore it had been born within the month <lb/>
of May&#x2014;born while Harriet was still trying to get <lb/>
her poem by heart, we think. I must not be asked <lb/>
how I know so much about that thrill; it is my <lb/>
secret. The biographer and I have private ways of <lb/>
finding out things when it is necessary to find them <lb/>
out and the customary methods fail.</p>
<p>Shelley left London that day, and was gone ten <lb/>
days. The biographer conjectures that he spent this <lb/>
interval with Harriet in Bath. It would be just like <lb/>
him. To the end of his days he liked to be in love <lb/>
with two women at once. He was more in love <lb/>
with Miss Hitchener when he married Harriet than <lb/>
he was with Harriet, and told the lady so with <lb/>
simple and unostentatious candor. He was more in <lb/>
love with Cornelia than he was with Harriet in the <lb/>
end of 1813 and the beginning of 1814, yet he sup- <lb/>
plied both of them with love poems of an equal <lb/>
temperature meantime; he loved Mary and Harriet <lb/>
in June, and while getting ready to run off with the <lb/>
one, it is conjectured that he put in his odd time <lb/>
trying to get reconciled to the other; by-and-by, <lb/>
while still in love with Mary, he will make love to <lb/>
<pb n="65"/>
her half-sister by marriage, adoption, and the visita- <lb/>
tion of God, through the medium of clandestine <lb/>
letters, and she will answer with letters that are for <lb/>
no eye but his own.</p>
<p>When Shelley encountered Mary Godwin he was <lb/>
looking around for another paradise. He had tastes <lb/>
of his own, and there were features about the God- <lb/>
win establishment that strongly recommended it. <lb/>
Godwin was an advanced thinker and an able writer. <lb/>
One of his romances is still read, but his philo- <lb/>
sophical works, once so esteemed, are out of vogue <lb/>
now; their authority was already declining when <lb/>
Shelley made his acquaintance&#x2014;that is, it was de- <lb/>
clining with the public, but not with Shelley. They <lb/>
had been his moral and political Bible, and they <lb/>
were that yet. Shelley the infidel would himself <lb/>
have claimed to be less a work of God than a work <lb/>
of Godwin. Godwin's philosophies had formed his <lb/>
mind and interwoven themselves into it and become <lb/>
a part of its texture; he regarded himself as God- <lb/>
win's spiritual son. Godwin was not without self- <lb/>
appreciation; indeed, it may be conjectured that <lb/>
from his point of view the last syllable of his name <lb/>
was surplusage. He lived serene in his lofty world <lb/>
of philosophy, far above the mean interests that <lb/>
absorbed smaller men, and only came down to the <lb/>
ground at intervals to pass the hat for alms to pay <lb/>
his debts with, and insult the man that relieved him. <lb/>
Several of his principles were out of the ordinary. <lb/>
For example, he was opposed to marriage. He was <lb/>
<pb n="66"/>
not aware that his preachings from this text were <lb/>
but theory and wind; he supposed he was in earnest <lb/>
in imploring people to live together without marry- <lb/>
ing, until Shelley furnished him a working model of <lb/>
his scheme and a practical example to analyze, by <lb/>
applying the principle in his own family; the matter <lb/>
took a different and surprising aspect then. The <lb/>
late Matthew Arnold said that the main defect in <lb/>
Shelley's make-up was that he was destitute of the <lb/>
sense of humor. This episode must have escaped <lb/>
Mr. Arnold's attention.</p>
<p>But we have said enough about the head of the <lb/>
new paradise. Mrs. Godwin is described as being <lb/>
in several ways a terror; and even when her soul <lb/>
was in repose she wore green spectacles. But I <lb/>
suspect that her main unattractiveness was born of <lb/>
the fact that she wrote the letters that are out in the <lb/>
appendix-basket in the back yard&#x2014;letters which <lb/>
are an outrage and wholly untrustworthy, for they <lb/>
say some kind things about poor Harriet and tell <lb/>
some disagreeable truths about her husband; and <lb/>
these things make the fabulist grit his teeth a good <lb/>
deal.</p>
<p>Next we have Fanny Godwin&#x2014;a Godwin by <lb/>
courtesy only; she was Mrs. Godwin's natural <lb/>
daughter by a former friend. She was a sweet and <lb/>
winning girl, but she presently wearied of the God- <lb/>
win paradise, and poisoned herself.</p>
<p>Last in the list is Jane (or Claire, as she preferred <lb/>
to call herself) Clairmont, daughter of Mrs. Godwin <lb/>
<pb n="67"/>
by a former marriage. She was very young and <lb/>
pretty and accommodating, and always ready to do <lb/>
what she could to make things pleasant. After <lb/>
Shelley ran off with her part-sister Mary, she be- <lb/>
came the guest of the pair, and contributed a natural <lb/>
child to their nursery&#x2014;Allegra. Lord Byron was <lb/>
the father.</p>
<p>We have named the several members and advan- <lb/>
tages of the new paradise in Skinner Street, with its <lb/>
crazy book-shop underneath. Shelley was all right <lb/>
now, this was a better place than the other; more <lb/>
variety anyway, and more different kinds of fra- <lb/>
grance. One could turn out poetry here without <lb/>
any trouble at all.</p>
<p>The way the new love-match came about was this: <lb/>
Shelley told Mary all his aggravations and sorrows <lb/>
and griefs, and about the wet-nurse and the bonnet- <lb/>
shop and the surgeon and the carriage, and the <lb/>
sister-in-law that blocked the London game, and <lb/>
about Cornelia and her mamma, and how they had <lb/>
turned him out of the house after making so much <lb/>
of him; and how he had deserted Harriet and then <lb/>
Harriet had deserted him, and how the reconciliation <lb/>
was working along and Harriet getting her poem by <lb/>
heart; and still he was not happy, and Mary pitied <lb/>
him, for she had had trouble herself. But I am not <lb/>
satisfied with this. It reads too much like statistics. <lb/>
It lacks smoothness and grace, and is too earthy and <lb/>
business-like. It has the sordid look of a trades- <lb/>
union procession out on strike. That is not the <lb/>
<pb n="68"/>
right form for it. The book does it better; we will <lb/>
fall back on the book and have a cake-walk: <lb/>
<q>"It was easy to divine that some restless grief possessed him; Mary <lb/>
herself was not unlearned in the lore of pain. His generous zeal in her <lb/>
father's behalf, his spiritual sonship to Godwin, his reverence for her <lb/>
mother's memory, were guarantees with Mary of his excellence.<ref target="n1">*</ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>What she was after was guarantees of his excellence. That he <lb/>
stood ready to desert his wife and child was one of them, apparently.</p></note> The <lb/>
new friends could not lack subjects of discourse, and underneath their <lb/>
words about Mary's mother, and 'Political Justice,' and 'Rights of <lb/>
Woman,' were two young hearts, each feeling towards the other, each <lb/>
perhaps unaware, trembling in the direction of the other. The desire <lb/>
to assuage the suffering of one whose happiness has grown precious to <lb/>
us may become a hunger of the spirit as keen as any other, and this <lb/>
hunger now possessed Mary's heart; when her eyes rested unseen on <lb/>
Shelley, it was with a look full of the ardor of a 'soothing pity.'"</q></p>
<p>Yes, that is better and has more composure. <lb/>
That is just the way it happened. He told her <lb/>
about the wet-nurse, she told him about political <lb/>
justice; he told her about the deadly sister-in-law, <lb/>
she told him about her mother; he told her about <lb/>
the bonnet-shop, she murmured back about the <lb/>
rights of woman; then he assuaged her, then she <lb/>
assuaged him; then he assuaged her some more, <lb/>
next she assuaged him some more; then they both <lb/>
assuaged one another simultaneously; and so they <lb/>
went on by the hour assuaging and assuaging and <lb/>
assuaging, until at last what was the result? They <lb/>
were in love. It will happen so every time.</p>
<q>"He had married a woman who, as he now persuaded himself, had <lb/>
never truly loved him, who loved only his fortune and his rank, and <lb/>
who proved her selfishness by deserting him in his misery."</q>
<pb n="69"/>
<p>I think that that is not quite fair to Harriet. We <lb/>
have no certainty that she knew Cornelia had turned <lb/>
him out of the house. He went back to Cornelia, <lb/>
and Harriet may have supposed that he was as <lb/>
happy with her as ever. Still, it was judicious to <lb/>
begin to lay on the whitewash, for Shelley is going <lb/>
to need many a coat of it now, and the sooner the <lb/>
reader becomes used to the intrusion of the brush <lb/>
the sooner he will get reconciled to it and stop <lb/>
fretting about it.</p>
<p>After Shelley's (conjectured) visit to Harriet at <lb/>
Bath&#x2014;8th of June to 18th&#x2014;"it seems to have <lb/>
been arranged that Shelley should henceforth join <lb/>
the Skinner Street household each day at dinner."</p>
<p>Nothing could be handier than this; things will <lb/>
swim along now.</p>
<q>"Although now Shelley was coming to believe that his wedded union <lb/>
with Harriet was a thing of the past, he had not ceased to regard her <lb/>
with affectionate consideration; he wrote to her frequentfy, and kept <lb/>
her informed of his whereabouts."</q>
<p>We must not get impatient over these curious <lb/>
inharmoniousnesses and irreconcilabilities in Shel- <lb/>
ley's character. You can see by the biographer's <lb/>
attitude towards them that there is nothing objec- <lb/>
tionable about them. Shelley was doing his best to <lb/>
make two adoring young creatures happy: he was <lb/>
regarding the one with affectionate consideration by <lb/>
mail, and he was assuaging the other one at home.</p>
<q>"Unhappy Harriet, residing at Bath, had perhaps never desired that <lb/>
<pb n="70"/>
the breach between herself and her husband should be irreparable and <lb/>
complete."</q>
<p>I find no fault with that sentence except that the <lb/>
"perhaps" is not strictly warranted. It should <lb/>
have been left out. In support&#x2014;or shall we say <lb/>
extenuation?&#x2014;of this opinion I submit that there <lb/>
is not sufficient evidence to warrant the uncertainty <lb/>
which it implies. The only "evidence "offered <lb/>
that Harriet was hard and proud and standing out <lb/>
against a reconciliation is a poem&#x2014;the poem in <lb/>
which Shelley beseeches her to "bid the remorse- <lb/>
less feeling flee "and "pity "if she "cannot love." <lb/>
We have just that as "evidence," and out of its <lb/>
meagre materials the biographer builds a cobhouse <lb/>
of conjectures as big as the Coliseum; conjectures <lb/>
which convince him, the prosecuting attorney, but <lb/>
ought to fall far short of convincing any fair-minded <lb/>
jury.</p>
<p>Shelley's love-poems may be very good evidence, <lb/>
but we know well that they are "good for this day <lb/>
and train only." We are able to believe that they <lb/>
spoke the truth for that one day, but we know by <lb/>
experience that they could not be depended on to <lb/>
speak it the next. The very supplication for a re- <lb/>
warming of Harriet's chilled love was followed so <lb/>
suddenly by the poet's plunge into an adoring pas- <lb/>
sion for Mary Godwin that if it had been a check it <lb/>
would have lost its value before a lazy person could <lb/>
have gotten to the bank with it.</p>
<p>Hardness, stubbornness, pride, vindictiveness&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="71"/>
these may sometimes reside in a young wife and <lb/>
mother of nineteen, but they are not charged against <lb/>
Harriet Shelley outside of that poem, and one has <lb/>
no right to insert them into her character on such <lb/>
shadowy "evidence "as that. Peacock knew Har- <lb/>
riet well, and she has a flexible and persuadable <lb/>
look, as painted by him: <lb/>
<q>"Her manners were good, and her whole aspect and demeanor such <lb/>
manifest emanations of pure and truthful nature that to be once in her <lb/>
company was to know her thoroughly. She was fond of her husband, <lb/>
and accommodated herself in every way to his tastes. If they mixed <lb/>
in society, she adorned it; if they lived in retirement, she was satisfied; <lb/>
if they travelled, she enjoyed the change of scene."</q></p>
<p>"Perhaps "she had never desired that the breach <lb/>
should be irreparable and complete. The truth is, <lb/>
we do not even know that there was any breach at <lb/>
all at this time. We know that the husband and <lb/>
wife went before the altar and took a new oath on <lb/>
the 24th of March to love and cherish each other <lb/>
until death&#x2014;and this may be regarded as a sort of <lb/>
reconciliation itself, and a wiping out of the old <lb/>
grudges. Then Harriet went away, and the sister- <lb/>
in-law removed herself from her society. That was <lb/>
in April. Shelley wrote his "appeal" in May, <lb/>
but the corresponding went right along afterwards. <lb/>
We have a right to doubt that the subject of it was <lb/>
a "reconciliation," or that Harriet had any suspi- <lb/>
cion that she needed to be reconciled and that her <lb/>
husband was trying to persuade her to it&#x2014;as the <lb/>
biographer has sought to make us believe, with his <lb/>
<pb n="72"/>
Coliseum of conjectures built out of a waste-basket <lb/>
of poetry. For we have "evidence" now&#x2014;not <lb/>
poetry and conjecture. When Shelley had been <lb/>
dining daily in the Skinner Street paradise fifteen <lb/>
days and continuing the love-match which was <lb/>
already a fortnight old twenty-five days earlier, he <lb/>
forgot to write Harriet; forgot it the next day and <lb/>
the next. During four days Harriet got no letter <lb/>
from him. Then her fright and anxiety rose to <lb/>
expression-heat, and she wrote a letter to Shelley's <lb/>
publisher which seems to reveal to us that Shelley's <lb/>
letters to her had been the customary affectionate <lb/>
letters of husband to wife, and had carried no ap- <lb/>
peals for reconciliation and had not needed to:</p>

</opener>
<p>"<smcap>My dear Sir,</smcap>&#x2014;You will greatly oblige me by giving the enclosed <lb/>
to Mr. Shelley. I would not trouble you, but it is now four days since <lb/>
I have heard from him, which to me is an age. Will you write by re- <lb/>
turn of post and tell me what has become of him? as I always fancy <lb/>
something dreadful has happened if I do not hear from him. If you <lb/>
tell me that he is well I shall not come to London, but if I do not hear <lb/>
from you or him I shall certainly come, as I cannot endure this dreadful <lb/>
state of suspense. You are his friend and you can feel for me.</p>
<closer>
<salute>"I remain yours truly,</salute>
<signed>"H. S."</signed>
</closer>
</quotedLetter>
<p>Even without Peacock's testimony that "her whole <lb/>
aspect and demeanor were manifest emanations of a <lb/>
pure and truthful nature," we should hold this to <lb/>
be a truthful letter, a sincere letter, a loving letter; <lb/>
it bears those marks; I think it is also the letter of <lb/>
a person accustomed to receiving letters from her <lb/>
<pb n="73"/>
husband frequently, and that they have been of a <lb/>
welcome and satisfactory sort, too, this long time <lb/>
back&#x2014;ever since the solemn remarriage and recon- <lb/>
ciliation at the altar most likely.</p>
<p>The biographer follows Harriet's letter with a <lb/>
conjecture. He conjectures that she "would now <lb/>
gladly have retraced her steps." Which means that <lb/>
it is proven that she had steps to retrace&#x2014;proven <lb/>
by the poem. Well, if the poem is better evidence <lb/>
than the letter, we must let it stand at that.</p>
<p>Then the biographer attacks Harriet Shelley's <lb/>
honor&#x2014;by authority of random and unverified gos- <lb/>
sip scavengered from a group of people whose very <lb/>
names make a person shudder: Mary Godwin, mis- <lb/>
tress to Shelley; her part-sister, discarded mistress <lb/>
of Lord Byron; Godwin, the philosophical tramp, <lb/>
who gathers his share of it from a shadow&#x2014;that is <lb/>
to say, from a person whom he shirks out of <lb/>
naming. Yet the biographer dignifies this sorry <lb/>
rubbish with the name of "evidence."</p>
<p>Nothing remotely resembling a distinct charge <lb/>
from a named person professing to know is offered <lb/>
among this precious "evidence."</p>
<list>
<item>1. "Shelley <i>believed"</i> so and so.</item>
<item>2. Byron's discarded mistress says that Shelley <lb/>
told Mary Godwin so and so, and <i>Mary</i> told <i>her.</i></item>
<item>3. "Shelley said" so and so&#x2014;and later "ad- <lb/>
mitted over and over again that he had been in <lb/>
error."</item>
<item>4. The unspeakable Godwin "wrote to Mr. Bax- <lb/>
<pb n="74"/>
ter "that he knew so and so "from unquestionable <lb/>
authority "&#x2014; name not furnished.</item>
</list>
<p>How any man in his right mind could bring him- <lb/>
self to defile the grave of a shamefully abused and <lb/>
defenceless girl with these baseless fabrications, this <lb/>
manufactured filth, is inconceivable. How any man, <lb/>
in his right mind or out of it, could sit down and <lb/>
coldly try to persuade anybody to believe it, or <lb/>
listen patiently to it, or, indeed, do anything but <lb/>
scoff at it and deride it, is astonishing.</p>
<p>The charge insinuated by these odious slanders is <lb/>
one of the most difficult of all offences to prove; it <lb/>
is also one which no man has a right to mention <lb/>
even in a whisper about any woman, living or dead, <lb/>
unless he knows it to be true, and not even then <lb/>
unless he can also <i>prove</i> it to be true. There is no <lb/>
justification for the abomination of putting this stuff <lb/>
in the book.</p>
<p>Against Harriet Shelley's good name there is not <lb/>
one scrap of tarnishing evidence, and not even a <lb/>
scrap of evil gossip, that comes from a source that <lb/>
entitles it to a hearing.</p>
<p>On the credit side of the account we have strong <lb/>
opinions from the people who knew her best. <lb/>
Peacock says: <lb/>
<q>"I feel it due to the memory of Harriet to state my most decided <lb/>
conviction that her conduct as a wife was as pure. as true, as abso- <lb/>
lutely faultless, as that of any who for such conduct are held most in <lb/>
honor."</q></p>
<p>Thornton Hunt, who had picked and published <lb/>
<pb n="75"/>
slight flaws in Harriet's character, says, as regards <lb/>
this alleged large one: <lb/>
<q>"There is not a trace of evidence or a whisper of scandal against <lb/>
her before her voluntary departure from Shelley."</q></p>
<p>Trelawney says: <lb/>
<q>"I was assured by the evidence of the few friends who knew both <lb/>
Shelley and his wife&#x2014;Hookham, Hogg, Peacock, and one of the <lb/>
Godwins&#x2014;that Harriet was perfectly innocent of all offence."</q></p>
<p>What excuse was there for raking up a parcel of <lb/>
foul rumors from malicious and discredited sources <lb/>
and flinging them at this dead girl's head? Her <lb/>
very defencelessness should have been her protec- <lb/>
tion. The fact that all letters to her or about her, <lb/>
with almost every scrap of her own writing, had <lb/>
been diligently mislaid, leaving her case destitute of <lb/>
a voice, while every pen-stroke which could help <lb/>
her husband's side had been as diligently preserved, <lb/>
should have excused her from being brought to <lb/>
trial. Her witnesses have all disappeared, yet we <lb/>
see her summoned in her grave-clothes to plead for <lb/>
the life of her character, without the help of an ad- <lb/>
vocate, before a disqualified judge and a packed <lb/>
jury.</p>
<p>Harriet Shelley wrote her distressed letter on the <lb/>
7th of July. On the 28th her husband ran away <lb/>
with Mary Godwin and her part-sister Claire to the <lb/>
Continent. He deserted his wife when her confine- <lb/>
ment was approaching. She bore him a child at the <lb/>
end of November, his mistress bore him another one <lb/>
<pb n="76"/>
something over two months later. The truants were <lb/>
back in London before either of these events <lb/>
occurred.</p>
<p>On one occasion, presently, Shelley was so pressed <lb/>
for money to support his mistress with that he went <lb/>
to his wife and got some money of his that was in <lb/>
her hands&#x2014;twenty pounds. Yet the mistress was <lb/>
not moved to gratitude; for later, when the wife <lb/>
was troubled to meet her engagements, the mistress <lb/>
makes this entry in her diary: <lb/>
<q>"Harriet sends her creditors here; nasty woman. Now we shall <lb/>
have to change our lodgings."</q></p>
<p>The deserted wife bore the bitterness and obloquy <lb/>
of her situation two years and a quarter; then she <lb/>
gave up, and drowned herself. A month afterwards <lb/>
the body was found in the water. Three weeks <lb/>
later Shelley married his mistress.</p>
<p>I must here be allowed to italicize a remark of the <lb/>
biographer's concerning Harriet Shelley: <lb/>
<q>"<i>That no act of Shelley's during the two years which immediately <lb/>
preceded her death tended to cause the rash act which brought her life <lb/>
to its close seems certain"</i></q></p>
<p>Yet her husband had deserted her and her chil- <lb/>
dren, and was living with a concubine all that time! <lb/>
Why should a person attempt to write biography <lb/>
when the simplest facts have no meaning to him? <lb/>
This book is littered with as crass stupidities as that <lb/>
one&#x2014;deductions by the page which bear no dis- <lb/>
coverable kinship to their premises.</p>
<pb n="77"/>
<p>The biographer throws off that extraordinary re- <lb/>
mark without any perceptible disturbance to his <lb/>
serenity; for he follows it with a sentimental justifi- <lb/>
cation of Shelley's conduct which has not a pang of <lb/>
conscience in it, but is silky and smooth and undu- <lb/>
lating and pious&#x2014;a cake-walk with all the colored <lb/>
brethren at their best. There may be people who <lb/>
can read that page and keep their temper, but it is <lb/>
doubtful.</p>
<p>Shelley's life has the one indelible blot upon it, <lb/>
but is otherwise worshipfully noble and beautiful. <lb/>
It even stands out indestructibly gracious and lovely <lb/>
from the ruck of these disastrous pages, in spite of <lb/>
the fact that they expose and establish his re- <lb/>
sponsibility for his forsaken wife's pitiful fate&#x2014;a <lb/>
responsibility which he himself tacitly admits in a <lb/>
letter to Eliza Westbrook, wherein he refers to his <lb/>
taking up with Mary Godwin as an act which Eliza <lb/>
"might excusably regard as the cause of her sister's <lb/>
ruin."</p>

<head><b>FENIMORE COOPER'S LITERARY <lb/>
OFFENCES</b></head>
<q><i>The Pathfinder</i> and <i>The Deerslayer</i> stand at the head of Cooper's <lb/>
novels as artistic creations. There are others of his works which con- <lb/>
tain parts as perfect as are to be found in these, and scenes even more <lb/>
thrilling. Not one can be compared with either of them as a finished <lb/>
whole.</q>
<q>The defects in both of these tales are comparatively slight. They were <lb/>
pure works of art.&#x2014;<i>Prof. Lounsbury.</i></q>
<q>The five tales reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention.</q>
<q>&#x2026; One of the very greatest characters in fiction, Natty Bumppo&#x2026;.</q>
<q>The craft of the woodsman, the tricks of the trapper, all the delicate <lb/>
art of the forest, were familiar to Cooper from his youth up.&#x2014;<i>Prof. Brander Matthews.</i></q>
<q>Cooper is the greatest artist in the domain of romantic fiction yet <lb/>
produced by America.&#x2014;<i>Wilkie Collins.</i></q>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> seems to me that it was far from right for the <lb/>
Professor of English Literature in Yale, the Pro- <lb/>
fessor of English Literature in Columbia, and Wilkie <lb/>
Collins to deliver opinions on Cooper's literature <lb/>
without having read some of it. It would have <lb/>
been much more decorous to keep silent and let <lb/>
persons talk who have read Cooper.</p>
<p>Cooper's art has some defects. In one place in <lb/>
<i>Deerslayer,</i> and in the restricted space of two-thirds <lb/>
of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offences against <lb/>
<pb n="79"/>
literary art out of a possible 115. It breaks the <lb/>
record.</p>
<p>There are nineteen rules governing literary art in <lb/>
the domain of romantic fiction&#x2014;some say twenty- <lb/>
two. In <i>Deerslayer</i> Cooper violated eighteen of <lb/>
them. These eighteen require:</p>
<list>
<item>1. That a tale shall accomplish something and <lb/>
arrive somewhere. But the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale accom- <lb/>
plishes nothing and arrives in the air.</item>
<item>2. They require that the episodes of a tale shall <lb/>
be necessary parts of the tale, and shall help to de- <lb/>
velop it. But as the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale is not a tale, <lb/>
and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the <lb/>
episodes have no rightful place in the work, since <lb/>
there was nothing for them to develop.</item>
<item>3. They require that the personages in a tale shall <lb/>
be alive, except in the case of corpses, and that <lb/>
always the reader shall be able to tell the corpses <lb/>
from the others. But this detail has often been <lb/>
overlooked in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale.</item>
<item>4. They require that the personages in a tale, <lb/>
both dead and alive, shall exhibit a sufficient excuse <lb/>
for being there. But this detail also has been over- <lb/>
looked in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale.</item>
<item>5. They require that when the personages of a <lb/>
tale deal in conversation, the talk shall sound like <lb/>
human talk, and be talk such as human beings would <lb/>
be likely to talk in the given circumstances, and <lb/>
have a discoverable meaning, also a discoverable <lb/>
purpose, and a show of relevancy, and remain in <lb/>
<pb n="80"/>
the neighborhood of the subject in hand, and be <lb/>
interesting to the reader, and help out the tale, and <lb/>
stop when the people cannot think of anything more <lb/>
to say. But this requirement has been ignored from <lb/>
the beginning of the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale to the end of it.</item>
<item>6. They require that when the author describes <lb/>
the character of a personage in his tale, the conduct <lb/>
and conversation of that personage shall justify said <lb/>
description. But this law gets little or no attention <lb/>
in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale, as Natty Bumppo's case will <lb/>
amply prove.</item>
<item>7. They require that when a personage talks like <lb/>
an illustrated, gilt-edged, tree-calf, hand-tooled, <lb/>
seven-dollar Friendship's Offering in the beginning <lb/>
of a paragraph, he shall not talk like a negro min- <lb/>
strel in the end of it. But this rule is flung down <lb/>
and danced upon in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale.</item>
<item>8. They require that crass stupidities shall not be <lb/>
played upon the reader as "the craft of the woods- <lb/>
man, the delicate art of the forest," by either the <lb/>
author or the people in the tale. But this rule is <lb/>
persistently violated in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale.</item>
<item>9. They require that the personages of a tale shall <lb/>
confine themselves to possibilities and let miracles <lb/>
alone; or, if they venture a miracle, the author <lb/>
must so plausibly set it forth as to make it look <lb/>
possible and reasonable. But these rules are not <lb/>
respected in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale.</item>
<item>10. They require that the author shall make the <lb/>
reader feel a deep interest in the personages of his <lb/>
<pb n="81"/>
tale and in their fate; and that he shall make the <lb/>
reader love the good people in the tale and hate the <lb/>
bad ones. But the reader of the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale dis- <lb/>
likes the good people in it, is indifferent to the <lb/>
others, and wishes they would all get drowned <lb/>
together.</item>
<item><p>11. They require that the characters in a tale <lb/>
shall be so clearly defined that the reader can tell <lb/>
beforehand what each will do in a given emergency. <lb/>
But in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale this rule is vacated.</p>
<p>In addition to these large rules there are some <lb/>
little ones. These require that the author shall</p></item>
<item>12. <i>Say</i> what he is proposing to say, not merely <lb/>
come near it.</item>
<item>13. Use the right word, not its second cousin,</item>
<item>14. Eschew surplusage.</item>
<item>15. Not omit necessary details.</item>
<item>16. Avoid slovenliness of form.</item>
<item>17. Use good grammar.</item>
<item>18. Employ a simple and straightforward style.</item>
</list>
<p>Even these seven are coldly and persistently vio- <lb/>
lated in the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale.</p>
<p>Cooper's gift in the way of invention was not a <lb/>
rich endowment; but such as it was he liked to <lb/>
work it, he was pleased with the effects, and indeed <lb/>
he did some quite sweet things with it. In his little <lb/>
box of stage properties he kept six or eight cunning <lb/>
devices, tricks, artifices for his savages and woods- <lb/>
men to deceive and circumvent each other with, and <lb/>
he was never so happy as when he was working <lb/>
<pb n="82"/>
these innocent things and seeing them go. A <lb/>
favorite one was to make a moccasined person <lb/>
tread in the tracks of the moccasined enemy, and <lb/>
thus hide his own trail. Cooper wore out barrels <lb/>
and barrels of moccasins in working that trick. <lb/>
Another stage-property that he pulled out of his <lb/>
box pretty frequently was his broken twig. He <lb/>
prized his broken twig above all the rest of his <lb/>
effects, and worked it the hardest. It is a restful <lb/>
chapter in any book of his when somebody doesn't <lb/>
step on a dry twig and alarm all the reds and whites <lb/>
for two hundred yards around. Every time a <lb/>
Cooper person is in peril, and absolute silence is <lb/>
worth four dollars a minute, he is sure to step on a <lb/>
dry twig. There may be a hundred handier things <lb/>
to step on, but that wouldn't satisfy Cooper. <lb/>
Cooper requires him to turn out and find a dry <lb/>
twig; and if he can't do it, go and borrow one. <lb/>
In fact, the Leather Stocking Series ought to have <lb/>
been called the Broken Twig Series.</p>
<p>I am sorry there is not room to put in a few <lb/>
dozen instances of the delicate art of the forest, as <lb/>
practised by Natty Bumppo and some of the other <lb/>
Cooperian experts. Perhaps we may venture two <lb/>
or three samples. Cooper was a sailor&#x2014;a naval <lb/>
officer; yet he gravely tells us how a vessel, driving <lb/>
towards a lee shore in a gale, is steered for a par- <lb/>
ticular spot by her skipper because he knows of an <lb/>
<i>undertow</i> there which will hold her back against the <lb/>
gale and save her. For just pure woodcraft, or <lb/>
<pb n="83"/>
sailorcraft, or whatever it is, isn't that neat? For <lb/>
several years Cooper was daily in the society of <lb/>
artillery, and he ought to have noticed that when a <lb/>
cannon-ball strikes the ground it either buries itself <lb/>
or skips a hundred feet or so; skips again a hundred <lb/>
feet or so&#x2014;and so on, till finally it gets tired and <lb/>
rolls. Now in one place he loses some "females" <lb/>
&#x2014; as he always calls women&#x2014;in the edge of a <lb/>
wood near a plain at night in a fog, on purpose to <lb/>
give Bumppo a chance to show off the delicate art <lb/>
of the forest before the reader. These mislaid <lb/>
people are hunting for a fort. They hear a cannon- <lb/>
blast, and a cannon-ball presently comes rolling into <lb/>
the wood and stops at their feet. To the females <lb/>
this suggests nothing. The case is very different <lb/>
with the admirable Bumppo. I wish I may never <lb/>
know peace again if he doesn't strike out promptly <lb/>
and <i>follow the track</i> of that cannon-ball across the <lb/>
plain through the dense fog and find the fort. Isn't <lb/>
it a daisy? If Cooper had any real knowledge of <lb/>
Nature's ways of doing things, he had a most deli- <lb/>
cate art in concealing the fact. For instance: one <lb/>
of his acute Indian experts, Chingachgook (pro- <lb/>
nounced Chicago, I think), has lost the trail of a <lb/>
person he is tracking through the forest. Appar- <lb/>
ently that trail is hopelessly lost. Neither you nor <lb/>
I could ever have guessed out the way to find it. It <lb/>
was very different with Chicago. Chicago was not <lb/>
stumped for long. He turned a running stream out <lb/>
of its course, and there, in the slush in its old <lb/>
<pb n="84"/>
bed, were that person's moccasin-tracks. The cur- <lb/>
rent did not wash them away, as it would have done <lb/>
in all other like cases&#x2014;no, even the eternal laws of <lb/>
Nature have to vacate when Cooper wants to put up <lb/>
a delicate job of woodcraft on the reader.</p>
<p>We must be a little wary when Brander Matthews <lb/>
tells us that Cooper's books "reveal an extraordi- <lb/>
nary fulness of invention." As a rule, I am quite <lb/>
willing to accept Brander Matthews's literary judg- <lb/>
ments and applaud his lucid and graceful phrasing <lb/>
of them; but that particular statement needs to be <lb/>
taken with a few tons of salt. Bless your heart, <lb/>
Cooper hadn't any more invention than a horse; <lb/>
and I don't mean a high-class horse, either; I mean <lb/>
a clothes-horse. It would be very difficult to find a <lb/>
really clever "situation" in Cooper's books, and <lb/>
still more difficult to find one of any kind which he <lb/>
has failed to render absurd by his handling of it. <lb/>
Look at the episodes of "the caves"; and at the <lb/>
celebrated scuffle between Maqua and those others <lb/>
on the table-land a few days later; and at Hurry <lb/>
Harry's queer water-transit from the castle to the <lb/>
ark; and at Deerslayer's half-hour with his first <lb/>
corpse; and at the quarrel between Hurry Harry <lb/>
and Deerslayer later; and at&#x2014;but choose for your- <lb/>
self; you can't go amiss.</p>
<p>If Cooper had been an observer his inventive <lb/>
faculty would have worked better; not more interest- <lb/>
ingly, but more rationally, more plausibly. Cooper's <lb/>
proudest creations in the way of "situations" suffer <lb/>
<pb n="85"/>
noticeably from the absence of the observer's pro- <lb/>
tecting gift. Cooper's eye was splendidly inaccurate. <lb/>
Cooper seldom saw anything correctly. He saw <lb/>
nearly all things as through a glass eye, darkly. Of <lb/>
course a man who cannot see the commonest little <lb/>
every-day matters accurately is working at a disad- <lb/>
vantage when he is constructing a "situation." In <lb/>
the <i>Deerslayer</i> tale Cooper has a stream which is <lb/>
fifty feet wide where it flows out of a lake; it <lb/>
presently narrows to twenty as it meanders along <lb/>
for no given reason, and yet when a stream acts like <lb/>
that it ought to be required to explain itself. Four- <lb/>
teen pages later the width of the brook's outlet from <lb/>
the lake has suddenly shrunk thirty feet, and be- <lb/>
come "the narrowest part of the stream." This <lb/>
shrinkage is not accounted for. The stream has <lb/>
bends in it, a sure indication that it has alluvial <lb/>
banks and cuts them; yet these bends are only <lb/>
thirty and fifty feet long. If Cooper had been a <lb/>
nice and punctilious observer he would have noticed <lb/>
that the bends were oftener nine hundred feet long <lb/>
than short of it.</p>
<p>Cooper made the exit of that stream fifty feet <lb/>
wide, in the first place, for no particular reason; in <lb/>
the second place, he narrowed it to less than twenty <lb/>
to accommodate some Indians. He bends a "sap- <lb/>
ling" to the form of an arch over this narrow <lb/>
passage, and conceals six Indians in its foliage. <lb/>
They are "laying" for a settler's scow or ark <lb/>
which is coming up the stream on its way to the <lb/>
<pb n="86"/>
lake; it is being hauled against the stiff current by a <lb/>
rope whose stationary end is anchored in the lake; <lb/>
its rate of progress cannot be more than a mile an <lb/>
hour. Cooper describes the ark, but pretty ob- <lb/>
scurely. In the matter of dimensions "it was little <lb/>
more than a modern canal-boat." Let us guess, <lb/>
then, that it was about one hundred and forty feet <lb/>
long. It was of "greater breadth than common." <lb/>
Let us guess, then, that it was about sixteen feet <lb/>
wide. This leviathan had been prowling down bends <lb/>
which were but a third as long as itself, and scraping <lb/>
between banks where it had only two feet of space <lb/>
to spare on each side. We cannot too much admire <lb/>
this miracle. A low-roofed log dwelling occupies <lb/>
"two-thirds of the ark's length"&#x2014;a dwelling <lb/>
ninety feet long and sixteen feet wide, let us say&#x2014; <lb/>
a kind of vestibule train. The dwelling has two <lb/>
rooms&#x2014;each forty-five feet long and sixteen feet <lb/>
wide, let us guess. One of them is the bedroom of <lb/>
the Hutter girls, Judith and Hetty; the other is the <lb/>
parlor in the daytime, at night it is papa's bed- <lb/>
chamber. The ark is arriving at the stream's exit <lb/>
now, whose width has been reduced to less than <lb/>
twenty feet to accommodate the Indians&#x2014;say to <lb/>
eighteen. There is a foot to spare on each side of <lb/>
the boat. Did the Indians notice that there was <lb/>
going to be a tight squeeze there? Did they notice <lb/>
that they could make money by climbing down out <lb/>
of that arched sapling and just stepping aboard <lb/>
when the ark scraped by? No, other Indians <lb/>
<pb n="87"/>
would have noticed these things, but Cooper's <lb/>
Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they <lb/>
are marvelous creatures for noticing, but he was <lb/>
almost always in error about his Indians. There <lb/>
was seldom a sane one among them.</p>
<p>The ark is one hundred and forty feet long; the <lb/>
dwelling is ninety feet long. The idea of the Indians <lb/>
is to drop softly and secretly from the arched sap- <lb/>
ling to the dwelling as the ark creeps along under it <lb/>
at the rate of a mile an hour, and butcher the <lb/>
family. It will take the ark a minute and a half to <lb/>
pass under. It will take the ninety foot dwelling a <lb/>
minute to pass under. Now, then, what did the six <lb/>
Indians do? It would take you thirty years to guess, <lb/>
and even then you would have to give it up, I be- <lb/>
lieve. Therefore, I will tell you what the Indians <lb/>
did. Their chief, a person of quite extraordinary <lb/>
intellect for a Cooper Indian, warily watched the <lb/>
canal-boat as it squeezed along under him, and when <lb/>
he had got his calculations fined down to exactly <lb/>
the right shade, as he judged, he let go and dropped. <lb/>
And <i>missed the house!</i> That is actually what he did. <lb/>
He missed the house, and landed in the stern of the <lb/>
scow. It was not much of a fall, yet it knocked <lb/>
him silly. He lay there unconscious. If the house <lb/>
had been ninety-seven feet long he would have made <lb/>
the trip. The fault was Cooper's, not his. The <lb/>
error lay in the construction of the house. Cooper <lb/>
was no architect.</p>
<p>There still remained in the roost five Indians. <lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
The boat has passed under and is now out of their <lb/>
reach. Let me explain what the five did&#x2014;you <lb/>
would not be able to reason it out for yourself. <lb/>
No. 1 jumped for the boat, but fell in the water <lb/>
astern of it. Then No. 2 jumped for the boat, but <lb/>
fell in the water still farther astern of it. Then No. <lb/>
3 jumped for the boat, and fell a good way astern <lb/>
of it. Then No. 4 jumped for the boat, and fell in <lb/>
the water <i>away</i> astern. Then even No. 5 made a <lb/>
jump for the boat&#x2014;for he was a Cooper Indian. <lb/>
In the matter of intellect, the difference between a <lb/>
Cooper Indian and the Indian that stands in front of <lb/>
the cigar-shop is not spacious. The scow episode <lb/>
is really a sublime burst of invention; but it does <lb/>
not thrill, because the inaccuracy of the details <lb/>
throws a sort of air of fictitiousness and general <lb/>
improbability over it. This comes of Cooper's in- <lb/>
adequacy as an observer.</p>
<p>The reader will find some examples of Cooper's <lb/>
high talent for inaccurate observation in the account <lb/>
of the shooting-match in <i>The Pathfinder</i>.</p>
<q>"A common wrought nail was driven lightly into the target, its head <lb/>
having been first touched with paint."</q>
<p>The color of the paint is not stated&#x2014;an im- <lb/>
portant omission, but Cooper deals freely in import- <lb/>
ant omissions. No, after all, it was not an important <lb/>
omission; for this nail-head is <i>a hundred yards from</i> <lb/>
the marksmen, and could not be seen by them at <lb/>
that distance, no matter what its color might be. <lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
How far can the best eyes see a common house-fly? <lb/>
A hundred yards? It is quite impossible. Very <lb/>
well; eyes that cannot see a house-fly that is a hun- <lb/>
dred yards away cannot see an ordinary nail-head at <lb/>
that distance, for the size of the two objects is the <lb/>
same. It takes a keen eye to see a fly or a nail- <lb/>
head at fifty yards&#x2014;one hundred and fifty feet. <lb/>
Can the reader do it?</p>
<p>The nail was lightly driven, its head painted, and <lb/>
game called. Then the Cooper miracles began. The <lb/>
bullet of the first marksman chipped an edge of the <lb/>
nail-head; the next man's bullet drove the nail a <lb/>
little way into the target&#x2014;and removed all the <lb/>
paint. Haven't the miracles gone far enough now? <lb/>
Not to suit Cooper; for the purpose of this whole <lb/>
scheme is to show off his prodigy, Deerslayer- <lb/>
Hawkeye - Long - Rifle-Leather-Stocking-Pathfinder- <lb/>
Bumppo before the ladies.</p>
<q>"'Be all ready to clench it, boys!' cried out Pathfinder, stepping <lb/>
into his friend's tracks the instant they were vacant. 'Never mind a <lb/>
new nail; I can see that, though the paint is gone, and what I can see <lb/>
I can hit at a hundred yards, though it were only a mosquito's eye. Be <lb/>
ready to clench!'</q>
<q>"The rifle cracked, the bullet sped its way, and the head of the nail <lb/>
was buried in the wood, covered by the piece of flattened lead."</q>
<p>There, you see, is a man who could hunt flies <lb/>
with a rifle, and command a ducal salary in a Wild <lb/>
West show to-day if we had him back with us.</p>
<p>The recorded feat is certainly surprising just as it <lb/>
stands; but it is not surprising enough for Cooper. <lb/>
<pb n="90"/>
Cooper adds a touch. He has made Pathfinder do <lb/>
this miracle with another man's rifle; and not only <lb/>
that, but Pathfinder did not have even the advantage <lb/>
of loading it himself. He had everything against <lb/>
him, and yet he made that impossible shot; and not <lb/>
only made it, but did it with absolute confidence, <lb/>
saying, "Be ready to clench." Now a person like <lb/>
that would have undertaken that same feat with a <lb/>
brickbat, and with Cooper to help he would have <lb/>
achieved it, too.</p>
<p>Pathfinder showed off handsomely that day before <lb/>
the ladies. His very first feat was a thing which no <lb/>
Wild West show can touch. He was standing with <lb/>
the group of marksmen, observing&#x2014;a hundred <lb/>
yards from the target, mind; one Jasper raised his <lb/>
rifle and drove the centre of the bull's-eye. Then <lb/>
the Quartermaster fired. The target exhibited no <lb/>
result this time. There was a laugh. "It's a dead <lb/>
miss," said Major Lundie. Pathfinder waited an <lb/>
impressive moment or two; then said, in that calm, <lb/>
indifferent, know-it-all way of his, "No, Major, he <lb/>
has covered Jasper's bullet, as will be seen if any <lb/>
one will take the trouble to examine the target."</p>
<p>Wasn't it remarkable! How <i>could</i> he see that <lb/>
little pellet fly through the air and enter that distant <lb/>
bullet-hole? Yet that is what he did; for nothing <lb/>
is impossible to a Cooper person. Did any of those <lb/>
people have any deep-seated doubts about this thing? <lb/>
No; for that would imply sanity, and these were all <lb/>
Cooper people.</p>
<pb n="91"/>
<q>"The respect for Pathfinder's skill and for his <i>quickness and accuracy <lb/>
of sight</i>" (the italics are mine) "was so profound and general, that the <lb/>
instant he made this declaration the spectators began to distrust their own <lb/>
opinions, and a dozen rushed to the target in order to ascertain the fact. <lb/>
There, sure enough, it was found that the Quartermaster's bullet had <lb/>
gone through the hole made by Jasper's, and that, too, so accurately <lb/>
as to require a minute examination to be certain of the circumstance, <lb/>
which, however, was soon clearly established by discovering one bullet <lb/>
over the other in the stump against which the target was placed."</q>
<p>They made a "minute" examination; but never <lb/>
mind, how could they know that there were two <lb/>
bullets in that hole without digging the latest one <lb/>
out? for neither probe nor eyesight could prove <lb/>
the presence of any more than one bullet. Did <lb/>
they dig? No; as we shall see. It is the Path- <lb/>
finder's turn now; he steps out before the ladies, <lb/>
takes aim, and fires.</p>
<p>But, alas! here is a disappointment; an in- <lb/>
credible, an unimaginable disappointment&#x2014;for the <lb/>
target's aspect is unchanged; there is nothing there <lb/>
but that same old bullet-hole!</p>
<q>"'If one dared to hint at such a thing,' cried Major Duncan, 'I <lb/>
should say that the Pathfinder has also missed the target!'"</q>
<p>As nobody had missed it yet, the "also" was <lb/>
not necessary; but never mind about that, for the <lb/>
Pathfinder is going to speak.</p>
<q>"'No, no, Major,' said he, confidently, 'that <i>would</i> be a risky <lb/>
declaration. I didn't load the piece, and can't say what was in it; but <lb/>
if it was lead, you will find the bullet driving down those of the Quarter- <lb/>
master and Jasper, else is not my name Pathfinder.'</q>
<q>"A shout from the target announced the truth of this assertion."</q>
<pb n="92"/>
<p>Is the miracle sufficient as it stands? Not for <lb/>
Cooper. The Pathfinder speaks again, as he "now <lb/>
slowly advances towards the stage occupied by the <lb/>
females": <lb/>
<q>"'That's not all, boys, that's not all; if you find the target touched <lb/>
at all, I'll own to a miss. The Quartermaster cut the wood, but you'll <lb/>
find no wood cut by that last messenger."</q></p>
<p>The miracle is at last complete. He knew&#x2014; <lb/>
doubtless <i>saw</i>&#x2014;at the distance of a hundred yards <lb/>
&#x2014;that his bullet had passed into the hole <i>without <lb/>
fraying the edges</i>. There were now three bullets in <lb/>
that one hole&#x2014;three bullets embedded procession- <lb/>
ally in the body of the stump back of the target. <lb/>
Everybody knew this&#x2014;somehow or other&#x2014;and <lb/>
yet nobody had dug any of them out to make sure. <lb/>
Cooper is not a close observer, but he is interesting. <lb/>
He is certainly always that, no matter what happens. <lb/>
And he is more interesting when he is not noticing <lb/>
what he is about than when he is. This is a con- <lb/>
siderable merit.</p>
<p>The conversations in the Cooper books have a <lb/>
curious sound in our modern ears. To believe that <lb/>
such talk really ever came out of people's mouths <lb/>
would be to believe that there was a time when time <lb/>
was of no value to a person who thought he had <lb/>
something to say; when it was the custom to spread <lb/>
a two-minute remark out to ten; when a man's <lb/>
mouth was a rolling-mill, and busied itself all day <lb/>
long in turning four-foot pigs of thought into thirty- <lb/>
foot bars of conversational railroad iron by attenua- <lb/>
<pb n="93"/>
tion; when subjects were seldom faithfully stuck to, <lb/>
but the talk wandered all around and arrived no- <lb/>
where; when conversations consisted mainly of <lb/>
irrelevancies, with here and there a relevancy, a <lb/>
relevancy with an embarrassed look, as not being <lb/>
able to explain how it got there.</p>
<p>Cooper was certainly not a master in the construc- <lb/>
tion of dialogue. Inaccurate observation defeated <lb/>
him here as it defeated him in so many other enter- <lb/>
prises of his. He even failed to notice that the <lb/>
man who talks corrupt English six days in the week <lb/>
must and will talk it on the seventh, and can't help <lb/>
himself. In the <i>Deerslayer</i> story he lets Deerslayer <lb/>
talk the showiest kind of book-talk sometimes, and <lb/>
at other times the basest of base dialects. For <lb/>
instance, when some one asks him if he has a sweet- <lb/>
heart, and if so, where she abides, this is his <lb/>
majestic answer: <lb/>
<q>"'She's in the forest&#x2014;hanging from the boughs of the trees, in a <lb/>
soft rain&#x2014;in the dew on the open grass&#x2014;the clouds that float about <lb/>
in the blue heavens&#x2014;the birds that sing in the woods&#x2014;the sweet <lb/>
springs where I slake my thirst&#x2014;and in all the other glorious gifts that <lb/>
come from God's Providence!'"</q></p>
<p>"And he preceded that, a little before, with this: <lb/>
<q>"'It consarns me as all things that touches a fri'nd consarns a <lb/>
fri'nd.'"</q></p>
<p>And this is another of his remarks: <lb/>
<q>"'If I was Injin born, now, I might tell of this, or carry in the scalp <lb/>
and boast of the expl'ite afore the whole tribe; or if my inimy had only <lb/>
been a bear'"&#x2014;and so on.</q></p>
<pb n="94"/>
<p>We cannot imagine such a thing as a veteran <lb/>
Scotch Commander-in-Chief comporting himself in <lb/>
the field like a windy melodramatic actor, but <lb/>
Cooper could. On one occasion Alice and Cora <lb/>
were being chased by the French through a fog in <lb/>
the neighborhood of their father's fort: <lb/>
<q>"'<i>Point de quartier aux coquins!</i>' cried an eager pursuer, who <lb/>
seemed to direct the operations of the enemy.</q>
<q>"'Stand firm and be ready, my gallant 60ths!' suddenly exclaimed <lb/>
a voice above them; 'wait to see the enemy; fire low, and sweep the <lb/>
glacis.'</q>
<q>"'Father! father!' exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist; 'it <lb/>
is I! Alice! thy own Elsie! spare, O! save your daughters!'</q>
<q>"'Hold!' shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of parental <lb/>
agony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and rolling back in solemn <lb/>
echo. ''Tis she! God has restored me my children! Throw open <lb/>
the sally-port; to the field, 60ths, to the field! pull not a trigger, lest ye <lb/>
kill my lambs! Drive off these dogs of France with your steel!'"</q></p>
<p>Cooper's word-sense was singularly dull. When <lb/>
a person has a poor ear for music he will flat and <lb/>
sharp right along without knowing it. He keeps <lb/>
near the tune, but it is <i>not</i> the tune. When a person <lb/>
has a poor ear for words, the result is a literary flat- <lb/>
ting and sharping; you perceive what he is intend- <lb/>
ing to say, but you also perceive that he doesn't <lb/>
<i>say</i> it. This is Cooper. He was not a word- <lb/>
musician. His ear was satisfied with the <i>approxi- <lb/>
mate</i> word. I will furnish some circumstantial <lb/>
evidence in support of this charge. My instances <lb/>
are gathered from half a dozen pages of the tale <lb/>
called <i>Deerslayer</i>. He uses "verbal," for "oral"; <lb/>
"precision," for "facility"; "phenomena," for <lb/>
<pb n="95"/>
"marvels"; "necessary," for "predetermined"; <lb/>
"unsophisticated," for "primitive"; "prepara- <lb/>
tion," for "expectancy"; "rebuked," for "sub- <lb/>
dued"; "dependent on," for "resulting from"; <lb/>
"fact," for "condition"; "fact," for "conjec- <lb/>
ture"; "precaution," for "caution"; "explain," <lb/>
for "determine"; "mortified," for "disap- <lb/>
pointed"; "meretricious," for "factitious"; "ma- <lb/>
terially," for "considerably"; "decreasing," for <lb/>
"deepening"; "increasing," for "disappearing"; <lb/>
"embedded," for "enclosed"; "treacherous," <lb/>
for "hostile"; "stood," for "stooped"; "soft- <lb/>
ened," for "replaced"; "rejoined," for "re- <lb/>
marked"; "situation," for "condition"; "dif- <lb/>
ferent," for "differing"; "insensible," for <lb/>
"unsentient"; "brevity," for "celerity"; "dis- <lb/>
trusted," for "suspicious"; "mental imbecility," <lb/>
for "imbecility"; "eyes," for "sight"; "coun- <lb/>
teracting," for "opposing"; "funeral obsequies," <lb/>
for "obsequies."</p>
<p>There have been daring people in the world who <lb/>
claimed that Cooper could write English, but they <lb/>
are all dead now&#x2014;all dead but Lounsbury. I don't <lb/>
remember that Lounsbury makes the claim in so <lb/>
many words, still he makes it, for he says that <i>Deer- <lb/>
slayer</i> is a "pure work of art." Pure, in that con- <lb/>
nection, means faultless&#x2014;faultless in all details&#x2014; <lb/>
and language is a detail. If Mr. Lounsbury had <lb/>
only compared Cooper's English with the English <lb/>
which he writes himself&#x2014;but it is plain that he <lb/>
<pb n="96"/>
didn't; and so it is likely that he imagines until this <lb/>
day that Cooper's is as clean and compact as his <lb/>
own. Now I feel sure, deep down in my heart, that <lb/>
Cooper wrote about the poorest English that exists <lb/>
in our language, and that the English of <i>Deerslayer</i> <lb/>
is the very worst that even Cooper ever wrote.</p>
<p>I may be mistaken, but it does seem to me that <lb/>
<i>Deerslayer</i> is not a work of art in any sense; it does <lb/>
seem to me that it is destitute of every detail that <lb/>
goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, it <lb/>
seems to me that <i>Deerslayer</i> is just simply a literary <lb/>
<foreign lang="ita"><i>delirium tremens</i>.</foreign></p>
<p>A work of art? It has no invention; it has no <lb/>
order, system, sequence, or result; it has no life- <lb/>
likeness, no thrill, no stir, no seeming of reality; its <lb/>
characters are confusedly drawn, and by their acts <lb/>
and words they prove that they are not the sort of <lb/>
people the author claims that they are; its humor is <lb/>
pathetic; its pathos is funny; its conversations are <lb/>
&#x2014;oh! indescribable; its love-scenes odious; its <lb/>
English a crime against the language.</p>
<p>Counting these out, what is left is Art. I think <lb/>
we must all admit that.</p>

<head><b>TRAVELING WITH A REFORMER</b></head>
<p><smcap>Last</smcap> spring I went out to Chicago to see the <lb/>
Fair, and although I did not see it my trip was <lb/>
not wholly lost&#x2014;there were compensations. In <lb/>
New York I was introduced to a major in the regular <lb/>
army who said he was going to the Fair, and we <lb/>
agreed to go together. I had to go to Boston first, <lb/>
but that did not interfere; he said he would go <lb/>
along, and put in the time. He was a handsome <lb/>
man, and built like a gladiator. But his ways were <lb/>
gentle, and his speech was soft and persuasive. He <lb/>
was companionable, but exceedingly reposeful. Yes, <lb/>
and wholly destitute of the sense of humor. He <lb/>
was full of interest in everything that went on around <lb/>
him, but his serenity was indestructible; nothing <lb/>
disturbed him, nothing excited him.</p>
<p>But before the day was done I found that deep <lb/>
down in him somewhere he had a passion, quiet as <lb/>
he was&#x2014;a passion for reforming petty public <lb/>
abuses. He stood for citizenship&#x2014;it was his <lb/>
hobby. His idea was that every citizen of the re- <lb/>
public ought to consider himself an unofficial police- <lb/>
man, and keep unsalaried watch and ward over the <lb/>
laws and their execution. He thought that the only <lb/>
<pb n="98"/>
effective way of preserving and protecting public <lb/>
rights was for each citizen to do his share in pre- <lb/>
venting or punishing such infringements of them as <lb/>
came under his personal notice.</p>
<p>It was a good scheme, but I thought it would <lb/>
keep a body in trouble all the time; it seemed to <lb/>
me that one would be always trying to get offend- <lb/>
ing little officials discharged, and perhaps getting <lb/>
laughed at for all reward. But he said no, I had <lb/>
the wrong idea; that there was no occasion to get <lb/>
anybody discharged; that in fact you <i>must n't</i> get <lb/>
anybody discharged; that that would itself be a <lb/>
failure; no, one must reform the man&#x2014;reform him <lb/>
and make him useful where he was.</p>
<p>"Must one report the offender and then beg his <lb/>
superior not to discharge him, but reprimand him <lb/>
and keep him?"</p>
<p>"No, that is not the idea; you don't report him <lb/>
at all, for then you risk his bread and butter. You <lb/>
can act as if you are <i>going</i> to report him&#x2014;when <lb/>
nothing else will answer. But that's an extreme <lb/>
case. That is a sort of <i>force</i>, and force is bad. <lb/>
Diplomacy is the effective thing. Now if a man has <lb/>
tact&#x2014;if a man will exercise diplomacy&#x2014;"</p>
<p>For two minutes we had been standing at a tele- <lb/>
graph wicket, and during all this time the Major had <lb/>
been trying to get the attention of one of the young <lb/>
operators, but they were all busy skylarking. The <lb/>
Major spoke now, and asked one of them to take <lb/>
his telegram. He got for reply:</p>
<pb n="99"/>
<p>"I reckon you can wait a minute, can't you?" <lb/>
and the skylarking went on.</p>
<p>The Major said yes, he was not in a hurry. Then <lb/>
he wrote another telegram: <lb/>
<q>"<i>President Western Union Tel. Co.:</i></q>
<q>"Come and dine with me this evening. I can tell you how business <lb/>
is conducted in one of your branches."</q></p>
<p>Presently the young fellow who had spoken so <lb/>
pertly a little before reached out and took the tele- <lb/>
gram, and when he read it he lost color and began <lb/>
to apologize and explain. He said he would lose <lb/>
his place if this deadly telegram was sent, and he <lb/>
might never get another. If he could be let off this <lb/>
time he would give no cause of complaint again. <lb/>
The compromise was accepted.</p>
<p>As we walked away, the Major said:</p>
<p>"Now, you see, that was diplomacy&#x2014;and you <lb/>
see how it worked. It wouldn't do any good to <lb/>
bluster, the way people are always doing&#x2014;that <lb/>
boy can always give you as good as you send, and <lb/>
you'll come out defeated and ashamed of yourself <lb/>
pretty nearly always. But you see he stands no <lb/>
chance against diplomacy. Gentle words and diplo- <lb/>
macy&#x2014;those are the tools to work with."</p>
<p>"Yes, I see; but everybody wouldn't have had <lb/>
your opportunity. It isn't everybody that is on <lb/>
those familiar terms with the president of the West- <lb/>
ern Union."</p>
<p>"Oh, you misunderstand. I don't know the <lb/>
president&#x2014;I only use him diplomatically. It is for <lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
his good and for the public good. There's no harm <lb/>
in it."</p>
<p>I said, with hesitation and diffidence:</p>
<p>"But is it ever right or noble to tell a lie?"</p>
<p>He took no note of the delicate self-righteousness <lb/>
of the question, but answered, with undisturbed <lb/>
gravity and simplicity:</p>
<p>"Yes, sometimes. Lies told to injure a person, <lb/>
and lies told to profit yourself are not justifiable, but <lb/>
lies told to help another person, and lies told in the <lb/>
public interest&#x2014;oh, well, that is quite another <lb/>
matter. Anybody knows that. But never mind <lb/>
about the methods: you see the result. That youth <lb/>
is going to be useful now, and well-behaved. He <lb/>
had a good face. He was worth saving. Why, he <lb/>
was worth saving on his mother's account if not his <lb/>
own. Of course, he has a mother&#x2014;sisters, too. <lb/>
Damn these people who are always forgetting that! <lb/>
Do you know, I've never fought a duel in my life&#x2014; <lb/>
never once&#x2014;and yet have been challenged, like <lb/>
other people. I could always see the other man's <lb/>
unoffending women folks or his little children stand- <lb/>
ing between him and me. <i>They</i> hadn't done any- <lb/>
thing&#x2014;I couldn't break <i>their</i> hearts, you know."</p>
<p>He corrected a good many little abuses in the <lb/>
course of the day, and always without friction&#x2014; <lb/>
always with a fine and dainty "diplomacy" which <lb/>
left no sting behind; and he got such happiness and <lb/>
such contentment out of these performances that I <lb/>
was obliged to envy him his trade&#x2014;and perhaps <lb/>
<pb n="101"/>
would have adopted it if I could have managed the <lb/>
necessary deflections from fact as confidently with <lb/>
my mouth as I believe I could with a pen, behind <lb/>
the shelter of print, after a little practice.</p>
<p>Away late that night we were coming up-town in <lb/>
a horse-car when three boisterous roughs got aboard, <lb/>
and began to fling hilarious obscenities and pro- <lb/>
fanities right and left among the timid passengers, <lb/>
some of whom were women and children. Nobody <lb/>
resisted or retorted; the conductor tried soothing <lb/>
words and moral suasion, but the roughs only called <lb/>
him names and laughed at him. Very soon I saw <lb/>
that the Major realized that this was a matter which <lb/>
was in his line; evidently he was turning over his <lb/>
stock of diplomacy in his mind and getting ready. <lb/>
I felt that the first diplomatic remark he made in <lb/>
this place would bring down a land-slide of ridicule <lb/>
upon him and maybe something worse; but before <lb/>
I could whisper to him and check him he had begun, <lb/>
and it was too late. He said, in a level and dispas- <lb/>
sionate tone:</p>
<p>"Conductor, you must put these swine out. I <lb/>
will help you."</p>
<p>I was not looking for that. In a flash the three <lb/>
roughs plunged at him. But none of them arrived. <lb/>
He delivered three such blows as one could not ex- <lb/>
pect to encounter outside the prize-ring, and neither <lb/>
of the men had life enough left in him to get up from <lb/>
where he fell. The Major dragged them out and <lb/>
threw them off the car, and we got under way again.</p>
<pb n="102"/>
<p>I was astonished; astonished to see a lamb act <lb/>
so; astonished at the strength displayed, and the <lb/>
clean and comprehensive result; astonished at the <lb/>
brisk and business-like style of the whole thing. <lb/>
The situation had a humorous side to it, considering <lb/>
how much I had been hearing about mild persuasion <lb/>
and gentle diplomacy all day from this pile-driver, <lb/>
and I would have liked to call his attention to that <lb/>
feature and do some sarcasms about it; but when I <lb/>
looked at him I saw that it would be of no use&#x2014;his <lb/>
placid and contented face had no ray of humor in <lb/>
it; he would not have understood. When we left <lb/>
the car, I said:</p>
<p>"That was a good stroke of diplomacy&#x2014;three <lb/>
good strokes of diplomacy, in fact."</p>
<p>"<i>That?</i> That wasn't diplomacy. You are quite <lb/>
in the wrong. Diplomacy is a wholly different thing. <lb/>
One cannot apply it to that sort, they would not <lb/>
understand it. No, that was not diplomacy; it was <lb/>
force."</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it, I&#x2014;yes, I think per- <lb/>
haps you are right."</p>
<p>"Right? Of course I am right. It was just <lb/>
force."</p>
<p>"I think, myself, it had the outside aspect of it. <lb/>
Do you often have to reform people in that way?"</p>
<p>"Far from it. It hardly ever happens. Not <lb/>
oftener than once in half a year, at the outside."</p>
<p>"Those men will get well?"</p>
<p>"Get well? Why, certainly they will. They are <lb/>
<pb n="103"/>
not in any danger. I know how to hit and where to <lb/>
hit. You noticed that I did not hit them under the <lb/>
jaw. That would have killed them."</p>
<p>I believed that. I remarked&#x2014;rather wittily, as I <lb/>
thought&#x2014;that he had been a lamb all day, but now <lb/>
had all of a sudden developed into a ram&#x2014;batter- <lb/>
ing ram; but with dulcet frankness and simplicity <lb/>
he said no, a battering-ram was quite a different <lb/>
thing and not in use now. This was maddening, <lb/>
and I came near bursting out and saying he had no <lb/>
more appreciation of wit than a jackass&#x2014;in fact, I <lb/>
had it right on my tongue, but did not say it, know- <lb/>
ing there was no hurry and I could say it just as <lb/>
well some other time over the telephone.</p>
<p>We started to Boston the next afternoon. The <lb/>
smoking-compartment in the parlor-car was full, and <lb/>
we went into the regular smoker. Across the aisle <lb/>
in the front seat sat a meek, farmer-looking old man <lb/>
with a sickly pallor in his face, and he was holding <lb/>
the door open with his foot to get the air. Presently <lb/>
a big brakeman came rushing through, and when <lb/>
he got to the door he stopped, gave the farmer an <lb/>
ugly scowl, then wrenched the door to with such <lb/>
energy as to almost snatch the old man's boot off. <lb/>
Then on he plunged about his business. Several <lb/>
passengers laughed, and the old gentleman looked <lb/>
pathetically shamed and grieved.</p>
<p>After a little the conductor passed along, and the <lb/>
Major stopped him and asked him a question in his <lb/>
habitually courteous way:</p>
<pb n="104"/>
<p>"Conductor, where does one report the mis- <lb/>
conduct of a brakeman? Does one report to you?"</p>
<p>"You can report him at New Haven if you want <lb/>
to. What has he been doing?"</p>
<p>The Major told the story. The conductor seemed <lb/>
amused. He said, with just a touch of sarcasm in <lb/>
his bland tones:</p>
<p>"As I understand you, the brakeman didn't <i>say</i> <lb/>
anything."</p>
<p>"No, he didn't say anything."</p>
<p>"But he scowled, you say."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And snatched the door loose in a rough way."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That's the whole business, is it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is the whole of it."</p>
<p>The conductor smiled pleasantly, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, if you want to report him, all right, but I <lb/>
don't quite make out what it's going to amount to. <lb/>
You'll say&#x2014;as I understand you&#x2014;that the brake- <lb/>
man insulted this old gentleman. They'll ask you <lb/>
what he <i>said</i>. You'll say he didn't say anything at <lb/>
all. I reckon they'll say, how are you going to <lb/>
make out an insult when you acknowledge yourself <lb/>
that he didn't say a word."</p>
<p>There was a murmur of applause at the con- <lb/>
ductor's compact reasoning, and it gave him pleas- <lb/>
ure&#x2014;you could see it in his face But the Major <lb/>
was not disturbed. He said:</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;now you have touched upon a crying <lb/>
<pb n="105"/>
defect in the complaint-system. The railway offi- <lb/>
cials&#x2014;as the public think and as you also seem to <lb/>
think&#x2014;are not aware that there are any kind of <lb/>
insults except <i>spoken</i> ones. So nobody goes to <lb/>
headquarters and reports insults of manner, insults <lb/>
of gesture, look, and so forth; and yet these are <lb/>
sometimes harder to bear than any words. They <lb/>
are bitter hard to bear because there is nothing <lb/>
tangible to take hold of; and the insulter can always <lb/>
say, if called before the railway officials, that he <lb/>
never dreamed of intending any offence. It seems <lb/>
to me that the officials ought to specially and <lb/>
urgently request the public to report <i>unworded</i> <lb/>
affronts and incivilities."</p>
<p>The conductor laughed, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, that <i>would</i> be trimming it pretty fine, <lb/>
sure!"</p>
<p>"But not too fine, I think. I will report this <lb/>
matter at New Haven, and I have an idea that I'll <lb/>
be thanked for it."</p>
<p>The conductor's face lost something of its com- <lb/>
placency; in fact, it settled to a quite sober cast as <lb/>
the owner of it moved away. I said:</p>
<p>"You are not really going to bother with that <lb/>
trifle, are you?"</p>
<p>"It isn't a trifle. Such things ought always to <lb/>
be reported. It is a public duty, and no citizen has <lb/>
a right to shirk it. But I sha'n't have to report this <lb/>
case."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<pb n="106"/>
<p>"It won't be necessary. Diplomacy will do the <lb/>
business. You'll see."</p>
<p>Presently the conductor came on his rounds again, <lb/>
and when he reached the Major he leaned over and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"That's all right. You needn't report him. He's <lb/>
responsible to me, and if he does it again I'll give <lb/>
him a talking to."</p>
<p>The Major's response was cordial:</p>
<p>"Now that is what I like! You mustn't think <lb/>
that I was moved by any vengeful spirit, for that <lb/>
wasn't the case. It was duty&#x2014;just a sense of <lb/>
duty, that was all. My brother-in-law is one of <lb/>
the directors of the road, and when he learns that <lb/>
you are going to reason with your brakeman the <lb/>
very next time he brutally insults an unoffending <lb/>
old man it will please him, you may be sure of <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>The conductor did not look as joyous as one might <lb/>
have thought he would, but on the contrary looked <lb/>
sickly and uncomfortable. He stood around a little; <lb/>
then said:</p>
<p>"I think something ought to be done to him <lb/>
<i>now</i>. I'll discharge him."</p>
<p>"Discharge him? What good would that do? <lb/>
Don't you think it would be better wisdom to teach <lb/>
him better ways and keep him?"</p>
<p>"Well, there's something in that. What would <lb/>
you suggest?"</p>
<p>"He insulted the old gentleman in presence of all <lb/>
<pb n="107"/>
these people. How would it do to have him come <lb/>
and apologize in their presence?"</p>
<p>"I'll have him here right off. And I want to say <lb/>
this: If people would do as you've done, and re- <lb/>
port such things to me instead of keeping mum and <lb/>
going off and blackguarding the road, you'd see a <lb/>
different state of things pretty soon. I'm much <lb/>
obliged to you."</p>
<p>The brakeman came and apologized. After he <lb/>
was gone the Major said:</p>
<p>"Now, you see how simple and easy that was. <lb/>
The ordinary citizen would have accomplished noth- <lb/>
ing&#x2014;the brother-in-law of a director can accomplish <lb/>
anything he wants to."</p>
<p>"But are you really the brother-in-law of a <lb/>
director?"</p>
<p>"Always. Always when the public interests re- <lb/>
quire it. I have a brother-in-law on all the boards <lb/>
&#x2014;everywhere. It saves me a world of trouble."</p>
<p>"It is a good wide relationship."</p>
<p>"Yes. I have over three hundred of them."</p>
<p>"Is the relationship never doubted by a con- <lb/>
ductor?"</p>
<p>"I have never met with a case. It is the honest <lb/>
truth&#x2014;I never have."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you let him go ahead and discharge <lb/>
the brakeman, in spite of your favorite policy? You <lb/>
know he deserved it."</p>
<p>The Major answered with something which really <lb/>
had a sort of distant resemblance to impatience:</p>
<pb n="108"/>
<p>"If you would stop and think a moment you <lb/>
wouldn't ask such a question as that. Is a brake- <lb/>
man a dog, that nothing but dog's methods will do <lb/>
for him? He is a man, and has a man's fight for <lb/>
life. And he always has a sister, or a mother, or <lb/>
wife and children to support. Always&#x2014;there are <lb/>
no exceptions. When you take his living away from <lb/>
him you take theirs away too&#x2014;and what have they <lb/>
done to you? Nothing. And where is the profit in <lb/>
discharging an uncourteous brakeman and hiring <lb/>
another just like him? It's unwisdom. Don't you <lb/>
see that the rational thing to do is to <i>reform</i> the <lb/>
brakeman and keep him? Of course it is."</p>
<p>Then he quoted with admiration the conduct of a <lb/>
certain division superintendent of the Consolidated <lb/>
road, in a case where a switchman of two years' <lb/>
experience was negligent once and threw a train off <lb/>
the track and killed several people. Citizens came <lb/>
in a passion to urge the man's dismissal, but the <lb/>
superintendent said:</p>
<p>"No, you are wrong. He has learned his lesson, <lb/>
he will throw no more trains off the track. He is <lb/>
twice as valuable as he was before. I shall keep <lb/>
him."</p>
<p>We had only one more adventure on the trip. Be- <lb/>
tween Hartford and Springfield the train-boy came <lb/>
shouting in with an armful of literature and dropped <lb/>
a sample into a slumbering gentleman's lap, and the <lb/>
man woke up with a start. He was very angry, and <lb/>
he and a couple of friends discussed the outrage <lb/>
<pb n="109"/>
with much heat. They sent for the parlor-car con- <lb/>
ductor and described the matter, and were deter- <lb/>
mined to have the boy expelled from his situation. <lb/>
The three complainants were wealthy Holyoke mer- <lb/>
chants, and it was evident that the conductor stood <lb/>
in some awe of them. He tried to pacify them, <lb/>
and explained that the boy was not under his <lb/>
authority, but under that of one of the news com- <lb/>
panies; but he accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>Then the Major volunteered some testimony for <lb/>
the defence. He said:</p>
<p>"I saw it all. You gentlemen have not meant to <lb/>
exaggerate the circumstances, but still that is what <lb/>
you have done. The boy has done nothing more <lb/>
than all train-boys do. If you want to get his ways <lb/>
softened down and his manners reformed, I am with <lb/>
you and ready to help, but it isn't fair to get him <lb/>
discharged without giving him a chance."</p>
<p>But they were angry, and would hear of no com- <lb/>
promise. They were well acquainted with the presi- <lb/>
dent of the Boston &amp; Albany, they said, and would <lb/>
put everything aside next day and go up to Boston <lb/>
and fix that boy.</p>
<p>The Major said he would be on hand too, and <lb/>
would do what he could to save the boy. One of <lb/>
the gentlemen looked him over, and said:</p>
<p>"Apparently it is going to be a matter of who <lb/>
can wield the most influence with the president. Do <lb/>
you know Mr. Bliss personally?"</p>
<p>The Major said, with composure:</p>
<pb n="110"/>
<p>"Yes; he is my uncle."</p>
<p>The effect was satisfactory. There was an awk- <lb/>
ward silence for a minute or more; then the <lb/>
hedging and the half-confessions of over-haste and <lb/>
exaggerated resentment began, and soon everything <lb/>
was smooth and friendly and sociable, and it was <lb/>
resolved to drop the matter and leave the boy's <lb/>
bread-and-butter unmolested.</p>
<p>It turned out as I had expected: the president of <lb/>
the road was not the Major's uncle at all&#x2014;except <lb/>
by adoption, and for this day and train only.</p>
<p>We got into no episodes on the return journey. <lb/>
Probably it was because we took a night train and <lb/>
slept all the way.</p>
<p>We left New York Saturday night by the Pennsyl- <lb/>
vania road. After breakfast the next morning we <lb/>
went into the parlor-car, but found it a dull place <lb/>
and dreary. There were but few people in it and <lb/>
nothing going on. Then we went into the little <lb/>
smoking-compartment of the same car and found <lb/>
three gentlemen in there. Two of them were grum- <lb/>
bling over one of the rules of the road&#x2014;a rule <lb/>
which forbade card-playing on the trains on Sunday. <lb/>
They had started an innocent game of high-low-jack <lb/>
and been stopped. The Major was interested. He <lb/>
said to the third gentleman:</p>
<p>"Did you object to the game?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. I am a Yale professor and a relig- <lb/>
ious man, but my prejudices are not extensive."</p>
<p>Then the Major said to the others:</p>
<pb n="111"/>
<p>"You are at perfect liberty to resume your game, <lb/>
gentlemen; no one here objects."</p>
<p>One of them declined the risk, but the other one <lb/>
said he would like to begin again if the Major would <lb/>
join him. So they spread an overcoat over their <lb/>
knees and the game proceeded. Pretty soon the <lb/>
parlor-car conductor arrived, and said brusquely:</p>
<p>"There, there, gentlemen, that won't do. Put <lb/>
up the cards&#x2014;it's not allowed."</p>
<p>The Major was shuffling. He continued to shuffle, <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"By whose order is it forbidden?"</p>
<p>"It's my order. I forbid it."</p>
<p>The dealing began. The Major asked:</p>
<p>"Did you invent the idea?"</p>
<p>"What idea?"</p>
<p>"The idea of forbidding card-playing on Sun- <lb/>
day."</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;of course not."</p>
<p>"Who did?"</p>
<p>"The company"</p>
<p>"Then it isn't your order, after all, but the com- <lb/>
pany's. Is that it?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But you don't stop playing; I have to <lb/>
require you to stop playing immediately."</p>
<p>"Nothing is gained by hurry, and often much is <lb/>
lost. Who authorized the company to issue such an <lb/>
order?"</p>
<p>"My dear sir, that is a matter of no consequence <lb/>
to me, and&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="112"/>
<p>"But you forget that you are not the only person <lb/>
concerned. It may be a matter of consequence to <lb/>
me. It is indeed a matter of very great importance <lb/>
to me. I cannot violate a legal requirement of my <lb/>
country without dishonoring myself; I cannot allow <lb/>
any man or corporation to hamper my liberties with <lb/>
illegal rules&#x2014;a thing which railway companies are <lb/>
always trying to do&#x2014;without dishonoring my <lb/>
citizenship. So I come back to that question: By <lb/>
whose authority has the company issued this order?"</p>
<p>"I don't <i>know</i>. That's <i>their</i> affair."</p>
<p>"Mine, too. I doubt if the company has any <lb/>
right to issue such a rule. This road runs through <lb/>
several States. Do you know what State we are in <lb/>
now, and what its laws are in matters of this <lb/>
kind?"</p>
<p>"Its laws do not concern me, but the company's <lb/>
orders do. It is my duty to stop this game, gentle- <lb/>
men, and it <i>must</i> be stopped."</p>
<p>"Possibly; but still there is no hurry. In hotels <lb/>
they post certain rules in the rooms, but they always <lb/>
quote passages from the State laws as authority for <lb/>
these requirements. I see nothing posted here of <lb/>
this sort. Please produce your authority and let us <lb/>
arrive at a decision, for you see yourself that you <lb/>
are marring the game."</p>
<p>"I have nothing of the kind, but I have my <lb/>
orders, and that is sufficient. They must be <lb/>
obeyed."</p>
<p>"Let us not jump to conclusions. It will be <lb/>
<pb n="113"/>
better all around to examine into the matter without <lb/>
heat or haste, and see just where we stand before <lb/>
either of us makes a mistake&#x2014;for the curtailing of <lb/>
the liberties of a citizen of the United States is a <lb/>
much more serious matter than you and the railroads <lb/>
seem to think, and it cannot be done in my person <lb/>
until the curtailer proves his right to do so. <lb/>
Now&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"My dear sir, <i>will</i> you put down those cards?"</p>
<p>"All in good time, perhaps. It depends. You <lb/>
say this order must be obeyed. <i>Must</i>. It is a <lb/>
strong word. You see yourself how strong it is. <lb/>
A wise company would not arm you with so drastic <lb/>
an order as this, of <i>course</i>, without appointing a <lb/>
penalty for its infringement. Otherwise it runs the <lb/>
risk of being a dead letter and a thing to laugh at. <lb/>
What is the appointed penalty for an infringement <lb/>
of this law?"</p>
<p>"Penalty? I never heard of any."</p>
<p>"Unquestionably you must be mistaken. Your <lb/>
company orders you to come here and rudely break <lb/>
up an innocent amusement, and furnishes you no <lb/>
way to enforce the order? Don't you see that that <lb/>
is nonsense? What do you <i>do</i> when people refuse <lb/>
to obey this order? Do you take the cards away <lb/>
from them?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Do you put the offender off at the next station?"</p>
<p>"Well, no&#x2014;of course we couldn't if he had a <lb/>
ticket."</p>
<pb n="114"/>
<p>"Do you have him up before a court?"</p>
<p>The conductor was silent and apparently troubled. <lb/>
The Major started a new deal, and said:</p>
<p>"You see that you are helpless, and that the <lb/>
company has placed you in a foolish position. You <lb/>
are furnished with an arrogant order, and you de- <lb/>
liver it in a blustering way, and when you come to <lb/>
look into the matter you find you haven't any way <lb/>
of enforcing obedience."</p>
<p>The conductor said, with chill dignity:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you have heard the order, and my <lb/>
duty is ended. As to obeying it or not, you will do <lb/>
as you think fit." And he turned to leave.</p>
<p>"But wait. The matter is not yet finished. I <lb/>
think you are mistaken about your duty being <lb/>
ended; but if it really is, I myself have a duty to <lb/>
perform yet."</p>
<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Are you going to report my disobedience at <lb/>
headquarters in Pittsburg?"</p>
<p>"No. What good would that do?"</p>
<p>"You must report me, or I will report you."</p>
<p>"Report me for what?"</p>
<p>"For disobeying the company's orders in not <lb/>
stopping this game. As a citizen it is my duty to <lb/>
help the railway companies keep their servants to <lb/>
their work."</p>
<p>"Are you in earnest?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I am in earnest. I have nothing against <lb/>
you as a man, but I have this against you as an <lb/>
<pb n="115"/>
officer&#x2014;that you have not carried out that order, <lb/>
and if you do not report me I must report you. <lb/>
And I will."</p>
<p>The conductor looked puzzled, and was thought- <lb/>
ful a moment; then he burst out with:</p>
<p>"I seem to be getting <i>myself</i> into a scrape! It's <lb/>
all a muddle; I can't make head or tail of it; it's <lb/>
never happened before; they always knocked under <lb/>
and never said a word, and so <i>I</i> never saw how <lb/>
ridiculous that stupid order with no penalty is. <i>I</i> <lb/>
don't want to report anybody, and I don't want to <lb/>
<i>be</i> reported&#x2014;why, it might do me no end of harm! <lb/>
Now <i>do</i> go on with the game&#x2014;play the whole day <lb/>
if you want to&#x2014;and don't let's have any more <lb/>
trouble about it!"</p>
<p>"No, I only sat down here to establish this <lb/>
gentleman's rights&#x2014;he can have his place now. <lb/>
But before you go won't you tell me what you think <lb/>
the company made this rule for? Can you imagine <lb/>
an excuse for it? I mean a rational one&#x2014;an ex- <lb/>
cuse that is not on its face silly, and the invention <lb/>
of an idiot?"</p>
<p>"Why, surely I can. The reason it was made is <lb/>
plain enough. It is to save the feelings of the other <lb/>
passengers&#x2014;the religious ones among them, I <lb/>
mean. They would not like it, to have the Sabbath <lb/>
desecrated by card-playing on the train."</p>
<p>"I just thought as much. They are willing to <lb/>
desecrate it themselves by traveling on Sunday, but <lb/>
they are not willing that other people&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="116"/>
<p>"By gracious, you've hit it! I never thought of <lb/>
that before. The fact is, it <i>is</i> a silly rule when you <lb/>
come to look into it."</p>
<p>At this point the train-conductor arrived, and was <lb/>
going to shut down the game in a very high-handed <lb/>
fashion, but the parlor-car conductor stopped him <lb/>
and took him aside to explain. Nothing more was <lb/>
heard of the matter.</p>
<p>I was ill in bed eleven days in Chicago and got no <lb/>
glimpse of the Fair, for I was obliged to return east <lb/>
as soon as I was able to travel. The Major secured <lb/>
and paid for a state-room in a sleeper the day before <lb/>
we left, so that I could have plenty of room and be <lb/>
comfortable; but when we arrived at the station a <lb/>
mistake had been made and our car had not been <lb/>
put on. The conductor had reserved a section for <lb/>
us&#x2014;it was the best he could do, he said. But the <lb/>
Major said we were not in a hurry, and would wait <lb/>
for the car to be put on. The conductor responded, <lb/>
with pleasant irony:</p>
<p>"It may be that <i>you</i> are not in a hurry, just as <lb/>
you say, but we <i>are</i>. Come, get aboard, gentle- <lb/>
men, get aboard&#x2014;don't keep us waiting."</p>
<p>But the Major would not get aboard himself nor <lb/>
allow me to do it. He wanted his car, and said he <lb/>
must have it. This made the hurried and perspiring <lb/>
conductor impatient, and he said:</p>
<p>"It's the best we can <i>do</i>&#x2014;we can't do impossi- <lb/>
bilities. You will take the section or go without. <lb/>
A mistake has been made and can't be rectified at <lb/>
<pb n="117"/>
this late hour. It's a thing that happens now and <lb/>
then, and there is nothing for it but to put up with <lb/>
it and make the best of it. Other people do."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is just it, you see. If they had stuck <lb/>
to their rights and enforced them you wouldn't be <lb/>
trying to trample mine under foot in this bland way <lb/>
now. I haven't any disposition to give you un- <lb/>
necessary trouble, but it is my duty to protect the <lb/>
next man from this kind of imposition. So I must <lb/>
have my car. Otherwise I will wait in Chicago and <lb/>
sue the company for violating its contract."</p>
<p>"Sue the company?&#x2014;for a thing like that!"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Do you really mean that?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I do."</p>
<p>The conductor looked the Major over wonder- <lb/>
ingly, and then said:</p>
<p>"It beats me&#x2014;it's bran-new&#x2014;I've never struck <lb/>
the mate to it before. But I swear I think you'd <lb/>
do it. Look here, I'll send for the station-master."</p>
<p>When the station-master came he was a good deal <lb/>
annoyed&#x2014;at the Major, not at the person who had <lb/>
made the mistake. He was rather brusque, and <lb/>
took the same position which the conductor had <lb/>
taken in the beginning; but he failed to move the <lb/>
soft-spoken artilleryman, who still insisted that he <lb/>
must have his car. However, it was plain that there <lb/>
was only one strong side in this case, and that that <lb/>
side was the Major's. The station-master banished <lb/>
his annoyed manner, and became pleasant and even <lb/>
<pb n="118"/>
half-apologetic. This made a good opening for a <lb/>
compromise, and the Major made a concession. He <lb/>
said he would give up the engaged state-room, but <lb/>
he must have <i>a</i> state-room. After a deal of <lb/>
ransacking, one was found whose owner was per- <lb/>
suadable; he exchanged it for our section, and we <lb/>
got away at last. The conductor called on us in the <lb/>
evening, and was kind and courteous and obliging, <lb/>
and we had a long talk and got to be good friends. <lb/>
He said he wished the public would make trouble <lb/>
oftener&#x2014;it would have a good effect. He said <lb/>
that the railroads could not be expected to do their <lb/>
whole duty by the traveler unless the traveler would <lb/>
take some interest in the matter himself.</p>
<p>I hoped that we were done reforming for the trip <lb/>
now, but it was not so. In the hotel-car, in the <lb/>
morning, the Major called for broiled chicken. The <lb/>
waiter said:</p>
<p>"It's not in the bill of fare, sir; we do not serve <lb/>
anything but what is in the bill."</p>
<p>"That gentleman yonder is eating a broiled <lb/>
chicken."</p>
<p>"Yes, but that is different. He is one of the <lb/>
superintendents of the road."</p>
<p>"Then all the more must I have broiled chicken. <lb/>
I do not like these discriminations. Please hurry&#x2014; <lb/>
bring me a broiled chicken."</p>
<p>The waiter brought the steward, who explained <lb/>
in a low and polite voice that the thing was impos- <lb/>
sible&#x2014;it was against the rule, and the rule was rigid.</p>
<pb n="119"/>
<p>"Very well, then, you must either apply it im- <lb/>
partially or break it impartially. You must take <lb/>
that gentleman's chicken away from him or bring <lb/>
me one."</p>
<p>The steward was puzzled, and did not quite know <lb/>
what to do. He began an incoherent argument, <lb/>
but the conductor came along just then, and asked <lb/>
what the difficulty was. The steward explained that <lb/>
here was a gentleman who was insisting on having a <lb/>
chicken when it was dead against the rule and not in <lb/>
the bill. The conductor said:</p>
<p>"Stick by your rules&#x2014;you haven't any option. <lb/>
Wait a moment&#x2014;is this the gentleman?" Then he <lb/>
laughed and said: "Never mind your rules&#x2014;it's <lb/>
my advice, and sound; give him anything he wants <lb/>
&#x2014;don't get him started on his rights. Give him <lb/>
whatever he asks for; and if you haven't got it, <lb/>
stop the train and get it."</p>
<p>The Major ate the chicken, but said he did it from <lb/>
a sense of duty and to establish a principle, for he <lb/>
did not like chicken.</p>
<p>I missed the Fair, it is true, but I picked up <lb/>
some diplomatic tricks which I and the reader may <lb/>
find handy and useful as we go along.</p>

<head><b>PRIVATE HISTORY OF THE "JUMPING <lb/>
FROG" STORY</b></head>
<p><smcap>Five</smcap> or six years ago a lady from Finland asked <lb/>
me to tell her a story in our negro dialect, so <lb/>
that she could get an idea of what that variety of <lb/>
speech was like. I told her one of Hopkinson <lb/>
Smith's negro stories, and gave her a copy of <lb/>
<i>Harper's Monthly</i> containing it. She translated it <lb/>
for a Swedish newspaper, but by an oversight <lb/>
named me as the author of it instead of Smith. I <lb/>
was very sorry for that, because I got a good lashing <lb/>
in the Swedish press, which would have fallen to his <lb/>
share but for that mistake; for it was shown that <lb/>
Boccaccio had told that very story, in his curt and <lb/>
meagre fashion, five hundred years before Smith <lb/>
took hold of it and made a good and tellable thing <lb/>
out of it.</p>
<p>I have always been sorry for Smith. But my own <lb/>
turn has come now. A few weeks ago Professor <lb/>
Van Dyke, of Princeton, asked this question:</p>
<p>"Do you know how old your Jumping Frog story <lb/>
is?"</p>
<p>And I answered:</p>
<pb n="121"/>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;forty-five years. The thing happened in <lb/>
Calaveras County in the spring of 1849."</p>
<p>"No; it happened earlier&#x2014;a couple of thousand <lb/>
years earlier; it is a Greek story."</p>
<p>I was astonished&#x2014;and hurt. I said:</p>
<p>"I am willing to be a literary thief if it has been <lb/>
so ordained; I am even willing to be caught robbing <lb/>
the ancient dead alongside of Hopkinson Smith, for <lb/>
he is my friend and a good fellow, and I think would <lb/>
be as honest as any one if he could do it without <lb/>
occasioning remark; but I am not willing to ante- <lb/>
date his crimes by fifteen hundred years. I must <lb/>
ask you to knock off part of that."</p>
<p>But the professor was not chaffing; he was in <lb/>
earnest, and could not abate a century. He named <lb/>
the Greek author, and offered to get the book and <lb/>
send it to me and the college text-book containing <lb/>
the English translation also. I thought I would like <lb/>
the translation best, because Greek makes me tired. <lb/>
January 30th he sent me the English version, and I <lb/>
will presently insert it in this article. It is my <lb/>
Jumping Frog tale in every essential. It is not <lb/>
strung out as I have strung it out, but it is all <lb/>
there.</p>
<p>To me this is very curious and interesting. <lb/>
Curious for several reasons. For instance:</p>
<p>I heard the story told by a man who was not tell- <lb/>
ing it to his hearers as a thing new to them, but as <lb/>
a thing which <i>they had witnessed and would re- <lb/>
member</i>. He was a dull person, and ignorant; he <lb/>
<pb n="122"/>
had no gift as a story-teller, and no invention; in <lb/>
his mouth this episode was merely history&#x2014;history <lb/>
and statistics; and the gravest sort of history, too; <lb/>
he was entirely serious, for he was dealing with what <lb/>
to him were austere facts, and they interested him <lb/>
solely because they <i>were</i> facts; he was drawing on <lb/>
his memory, not his mind; he saw no humor in his <lb/>
tale, neither did his listeners; neither he nor they <lb/>
ever smiled or laughed; in my time I have not <lb/>
attended a more solemn conference. To him and <lb/>
to his fellow gold-miners there were just two things <lb/>
in the story that were worth considering. One was <lb/>
the smartness of the stranger in taking in its hero, <lb/>
Jim Smiley, with a loaded frog; and the other was the <lb/>
stranger's deep knowledge of a frog's nature&#x2014;for <lb/>
he knew (as the narrator asserted and the listeners <lb/>
conceded) that a frog <i>likes shot</i> and is always ready <lb/>
to eat it. Those men discussed those two points, <lb/>
and those only. They were hearty in their admira- <lb/>
tion of them, and none of the party was aware that <lb/>
a first-rate story had been told in a first-rate way, <lb/>
and that it was brimful of a quality whose presence <lb/>
they never suspected&#x2014;humor.</p>
<p>Now, then, the interesting question is, <i>did</i> the <lb/>
frog episode happen in Angel's Camp in the spring <lb/>
of '49, as told in my hearing that day in the fall of <lb/>
1865? I am perfectly sure that it did. I am also <lb/>
sure that its duplicate happened in B&#x0153;otia a couple <lb/>
of thousand years ago. I think it must be a case of <lb/>
history actually repeating itself, and not a case of a <lb/>
<pb n="123"/>
good story floating down the ages and surviving be- <lb/>
cause too good to be allowed to perish.</p>
<p>I would now like to have the reader examine the <lb/>
Greek story and the story told by the dull and <lb/>
solemn Californian, and observe how exactly alike <lb/>
they are in essentials.</p>
<q>[<i>Translation</i>.]</q>
<q>THE ATHENIAN AND THE FROG.<ref target="n2">*</ref><note id="n2" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Sidgwick, <i>Greek Prose Composition</i>, page 116.</p></note></q>
<q>An Athenian once fell in with a B&#x0153;otian who was sitting by the road- <lb/>
side looking at a frog. Seeing the other approach, the B&#x0153;otian said his <lb/>
was a remarkable frog, and asked if he would agree to start a contest of <lb/>
frogs, on condition that he whose frog jumped farthest should receive a <lb/>
large sum of money. The Athenian replied that he would if the other <lb/>
would fetch him a frog, for the lake was near. To this he agreed, and <lb/>
when he was gone the Athenian took the frog, and, opening its mouth, <lb/>
poured some stones into its stomach, so that it did not indeed seem <lb/>
larger than before, but could not jump. The B&#x0153;otian soon returned <lb/>
with the other frog, and the contest began. The second frog first was <lb/>
pinched, and jumped moderately; then they pinched the B&#x0153;otian frog. <lb/>
And he gathered himself for a leap, and used the utmost effort, but <lb/>
he could not move his body the least. So the Athenian departed with <lb/>
the money. When he was gone the B&#x0153;otian, wondering what was the <lb/>
matter with the frog, lifted him up and examined him. And being <lb/>
turned upside down, he opened his mouth and vomited out the stones.</q>
<p>And here is the way it happened in California: <lb/>
<q><smcap>from "the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras <lb/>
county."</smcap></q>
<q>Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom- <lb/>
cats, and all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't <lb/>
fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a <lb/>
frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; <lb/>
and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard <lb/>
<pb n="124"/>
and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i> learn him, too. <lb/>
He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see <lb/>
that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut&#x2014;see him turn one summer- <lb/>
set, or maybe a couple if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed <lb/>
and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching <lb/>
flies, and kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time <lb/>
as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was educa- <lb/>
tion, and he could do 'most anything&#x2014;and I believe him. Why, I've <lb/>
seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor&#x2014;Dan'l Webster <lb/>
was the name of the frog&#x2014;and sing out "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and <lb/>
quicker'n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a fly off'n <lb/>
the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of <lb/>
mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as <lb/>
indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog <lb/>
might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he <lb/>
was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square <lb/>
jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle <lb/>
than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level <lb/>
was his strong suit, you understand; and when it came to that, Smiley <lb/>
would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was <lb/>
monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had <lb/>
traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever <lb/>
<i>they</i> see.</q>
<q>Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to <lb/>
fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller <lb/>
&#x2014;a stranger in the camp, he was&#x2014;come acrost him with his box, <lb/>
and says:</q>
<q>"What might it be that you've got in the box?"</q>
<q>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, "It might be a parrot, or it <lb/>
might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't&#x2014;it's only just a frog."</q>
<q>And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this <lb/>
way and that, and says, "H'm&#x2014;so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good for?"</q>
<q>"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "he's good enough for <i>one</i> <lb/>
thing, I should judge&#x2014;he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County."</q>
<q>The feller took the box again and took another long, particular look, <lb/>
and gave it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well," he says, <lb/>
"I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other <lb/>
frog."</q>
<q>"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs <lb/>
<pb n="125"/>
and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, <lb/>
and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got <lb/>
<i>my</i> opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in <lb/>
Calaveras County."</q>
<q>And the feller studies a minute, and then says, kinder sad-like, <lb/>
"Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog, but if I had <lb/>
a frog I'd bet you."</q>
<q>And then Smiley says: "That's all right&#x2014;that's all right&#x2014;if you'll <lb/>
hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the feller <lb/>
took the box and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's and set <lb/>
down to wait.</q>
<q>So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and <lb/>
then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon <lb/>
and filled him full of quail shot&#x2014;filled him pretty near up to his chin <lb/>
&#x2014;and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped <lb/>
around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog and <lb/>
fetched him in and give him to this feller, and says:</q>
<q>"Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws <lb/>
just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One <lb/>
&#x2014;two&#x2014;three&#x2014;<i>git!</i>" and him and the feller touched up the frogs <lb/>
from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively; but Dan'l give a <lb/>
heave, and hysted up his shoulders&#x2014;so&#x2014;like a Frenchman, but it <lb/>
warn't no use&#x2014;he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, <lb/>
and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was <lb/>
a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted, too, but he didn't have no <lb/>
idea what the matter was, of course.</q>
<q>The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going <lb/>
out at the door he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder&#x2014;so&#x2014;at <lb/>
Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate: "Well," he says, "<i>I</i> don't see <lb/>
no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog."</q>
<q>Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a <lb/>
long time, and at last he says, "I do wonder what in the nation that <lb/>
frog throw'd off for&#x2014;I wonder if there ain't something the matter with <lb/>
him&#x2014;he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow." And he ketched <lb/>
Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, "Why, blame <lb/>
my cats if he don't weigh five pound!" and turned him upside down, <lb/>
and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it <lb/>
was, and he was the maddest man&#x2014;he set the frog down and took out <lb/>
after that feller, but he never ketched him.</q></p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p>The resemblances are deliciously exact. There <lb/>
you have the wily B&#x0153;otian and the wily Jim Smiley <lb/>
waiting&#x2014;two thousand years apart&#x2014;and waiting, <lb/>
each equipped with his frog and "laying" for the <lb/>
stranger. A contest is proposed&#x2014;for money. The <lb/>
Athenian would take a chance "if the other would <lb/>
fetch him a frog"; the Yankee says: "I'm only a <lb/>
stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had <lb/>
a frog I'd bet you." The wily B&#x0153;otian and the <lb/>
wily Californian, with that vast gulf of two thousand <lb/>
years between, retire eagerly and go frogging in the <lb/>
marsh; the Athenian and the Yankee remain behind <lb/>
and work a base advantage, the one with pebbles, <lb/>
the other with shot. Presently the contest began. <lb/>
In the one case "they pinched the B&#x0153;otian frog"; <lb/>
in the other, "him and the feller touched up the <lb/>
frogs from behind." The B&#x0153;otian frog "gathered <lb/>
himself for a leap" (you can just <i>see</i> him!), "but <lb/>
could not move his body in the least": the Cali- <lb/>
fornian frog "give a heave, but it warn't no use&#x2014; <lb/>
he couldn't budge." In both the ancient and the <lb/>
modern cases the strangers departed with the money. <lb/>
The B&#x0153;otian and the Californian wonder what is the <lb/>
matter with their frogs; they lift them and examine; <lb/>
they turn them upside down and out spills the in- <lb/>
forming ballast.</p>
<p>Yes, the resemblances are curiously exact. I <lb/>
used to tell the story of the Jumping Frog in San <lb/>
Francisco, and presently Artemus Ward came along <lb/>
and wanted it to help fill out a little book which he <lb/>
<pb n="127"/>
was about to publish; so I wrote it out and sent it <lb/>
to his publisher, Carleton; but Carleton thought the <lb/>
book had enough matter in it, so he gave the story <lb/>
to Henry Clapp as a present, and Clapp put it in <lb/>
his <i>Saturday Press</i>, and it killed that paper with a <lb/>
suddenness that was beyond praise. At least the <lb/>
paper died with that issue, and none but envious <lb/>
people have ever tried to rob me of the honor and <lb/>
credit of killing it. The "Jumping Frog" was the <lb/>
first piece of writing of mine that spread itself <lb/>
through the newspapers and brought me into public <lb/>
notice. Consequently, the <i>Saturday Press</i> was a <lb/>
cocoon and I the worm in it; also, I was the gay- <lb/>
colored literary moth which its death set free. This <lb/>
simile has been used before.</p>
<p>Early in '66 the "Jumping Frog" was issued in <lb/>
book form, with other sketches of mine. A year or <lb/>
two later Madame Blanc translated it into French <lb/>
and published it in the <foreign lang="fre"><i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,</foreign> <lb/>
but the result was not what should have been ex- <lb/>
pected, for the <i>Revue</i> struggled along and pulled <lb/>
through, and is alive yet. I think the fault must <lb/>
have been in the translation. I ought to have trans- <lb/>
lated it myself. I think so because I examined into <lb/>
the matter and finally retranslated the sketch from <lb/>
the French back into English, to see what the <lb/>
trouble was; that is, to see just what sort of a focus <lb/>
the French people got upon it. Then the mystery <lb/>
was explained. In French the story is too confused, <lb/>
and chaotic, and unreposeful, and ungrammatical, <lb/>
<pb n="128"/>
and insane; consequently it could only cause grief <lb/>
and sickness&#x2014;it could not kill. A glance at my <lb/>
re-translation will show the reader that this must be <lb/>
true.</p>

<q><smcap>the frog jumping of the county of calaveras.</smcap></q>
<q><foreign lang="ger">Eh bien!</foreign> this Smiley nourished some terriers &#x00E0; rats, and some cocks <lb/>
of combat, and some cats, and all sort of things; and with his rage of <lb/>
betting one no had more of repose. He trapped one day a frog and <lb/>
him imported with him <foreign lang="fre">(et l'emporta chez lui)</foreign> saying that he pretended <lb/>
to make his education. You me believe if you will, but during three <lb/>
months he not has nothing done but to him apprehend to jump <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre">(apprendre &#x00E0; sauter)</foreign> in a court retired of her mansion <foreign lang="fre">(de sa maison).</foreign> <lb/>
And I you respond that he have succeeded. He him gives a small <lb/>
blow by behind, and the instant after you shall see the frog turn in the <lb/>
air like a grease-biscuit, make one summersault, sometimes two, when <lb/>
she was well started, and re-fall upon his feet like a cat. He him had <lb/>
accomplished in the art of to gobble the flies <foreign lang="fre">(gober des mouches),</foreign> and <lb/>
him there exercised continually&#x2014;so well that a fly at the most far that she <lb/>
appeared was a fly lost. Smiley had custom to say that all which lacked <lb/>
to a frog it was the education, but with the education she could do nearly <lb/>
all&#x2014;and I him believe. Tenez, I him have seen pose Daniel Webster <lb/>
there upon this plank&#x2014;Daniel Webster was the name of the frog&#x2014;and <lb/>
to him sing, "Some flies, Daniel, some flies!"&#x2014;in a flash of the eye <lb/>
Daniel had bounded and seized a fly here upon the counter, then jumped <lb/>
anew at the earth, where he rested truly to himself scratch the head with <lb/>
his behind-foot, as if he no had not the least idea of his superiority. <lb/>
Never you not have seen frog as modest, as natural, sweet as she was. <lb/>
And when he himself agitated to jump purely and simply upon plain <lb/>
earth, she does more ground in one jump than any beast of his species <lb/>
than you can know.</q>
<q>To jump plain&#x2014;this was his strong. When he himself agitated for <lb/>
that Smiley multiplied the bets upon her as long as there to him remained <lb/>
a red. It must to know, Smiley was monstrously proud of his frog, and <lb/>
he of it was right, for some men who were traveled, who had all seen, <lb/>
said that they to him would be injurious to him compare to another frog. <lb/>
Smiley guarded Daniel in a little box latticed which he carried bytimes <lb/>
to the village for some bet.</q>
<pb n="129"/>
<q>One day an individual stranger at the camp him arrested with his box <lb/>
and him said:</q>
<q>"What is this that you have then shut up there within?"</q>
<q>Smiley said, with an air indifferent:</q>
<q>"That could be a paroquet, or a syringe <foreign lang="ind">(<i>ou un serin</i>),</foreign> but this no is <lb/>
nothing of such, it not is but a frog."</q>
<q>The individual it took, it regarded with care, it turned from one side <lb/>
and from the other, then he said:</q>
<q>"<foreign lang="fre"><i>Tiens!</i></foreign> in effect!&#x2014;At what is she good?"</q>
<q>"My God!" respond Smiley, always with an air disengaged, "she is <lb/>
good for one thing, to my notice (<foreign lang="fre"><i>&#x00E0; mon avis</i>)</foreign>, she can batter in jump- <lb/>
ing (<foreign lang="fre"><i>elle peut batter en sautant</i></foreign>) all frogs of the county of Calaveras."</q>
<q>The individual re-took the box, it examined of new longly, and it <lb/>
rendered to Smiley in saying with an air deliberate:</q>
<q>"<foreign lang="ger"><i>Eh bien!</i></foreign> I no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each <lb/>
frog." (<foreign lang="fre"><i>Je ne vois pas que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux qu'aucune <lb/>
grenouille</i></foreign>.) [If that isn't grammar gone to seed, then I count myself <lb/>
no judge.&#x2014;M. T.]</q>
<q>"Possible that you not it saw not," said Smiley, "possible that you <lb/>
&#x2014;you comprehend frogs; possible that you not you there comprehend <lb/>
nothing; possible that you had of the experience, and possible that you <lb/>
not be but an amateur. Of all manner (<foreign lang="fre"><i>De toute mani&#x00E8;re</i></foreign>) I bet forty <lb/>
dollars that she batter in jumping no matter which frog of the county of <lb/>
Calaveras."</q>
<q>The individual reflected a second, and said like sad:</q>
<q>"I not am but a stranger here, I no have not a frog; but if I of it <lb/>
had one, I would embrace the bet."</q>
<q>"Strong, well!" respond Smiley; "nothing of more facility. If <lb/>
you will hold my box a minute, I go you to search a frog <foreign lang="fre"> (<i>j'irai vous <lb/>
chercher</i>)."</foreign></q>
<q>Behold, then, the individual, who guards the box, who puts his forty <lb/>
dollars upon those of Smiley, and who attends (<foreign lang="fre"><i>et qui attend</i></foreign>). He <lb/>
attended enough longtimes, reflecting all solely. And figure you that <lb/>
he takes Daniel, him opens the mouth by force and with a teaspoon <lb/>
him fills with shot of the hunt, even him fills just to the chin, then he <lb/>
him puts by the earth. Smiley during these times was at slopping in a <lb/>
swamp. Finally he trapped (<foreign lang="fre"><i>attrape</i></foreign>) a frog, him carried to that indi- <lb/>
vidual, and said:</q>
<q>"Now if you be ready, put him all against Daniel, with their before- <lb/>
<pb n="130"/>
feet upon the same line, and I give the signal"&#x2014;then he added: <lb/>
"One, two, three&#x2014;advance!"</q>
<q>Him and the individual touched their frogs by behind, and the frog <lb/>
new put to jump smartly, but Daniel himself lifted ponderously, exalted <lb/>
the shoulders thus, like a Frenchman&#x2014;to what good? he could not <lb/>
budge, he is planted solid like a church, he not advance no more than if <lb/>
one him had put at the anchor.</q>
<q>Smiley was surprised and disgusted, but he not himself doubted not <lb/>
of the turn being intended (<foreign lang="fre"><i>mais il ne se doutait pas du tour bien <lb/>
entendu</i></foreign>). The individual empocketed the silver, himself with it went, <lb/>
and of it himself in going is that he no gives not a jerk of thumb over <lb/>
the shoulder&#x2014;like that&#x2014;at the poor Daniel, in saying with his air <lb/>
deliberate&#x2014;(<foreign lang="fre"><i>L'individu empoche l'argent s'en va et en s'en allant est <lb/>
ce qu'il ne donne pas un coup de pouce par-dessus l'&#x00E8;paule, comme, &#x00E7;a, <lb/>
au pauvre Daniel, en disant de son air d&#x00E9;lib&#x00E9;r&#x00E9;</i>.</foreign>)</q>
<q><foreign lang="ger">"Eh bien!</foreign> <i>I no see not that that frog has nothing of better than <lb/>
another</i>."</q>
<q>Smiley himself scratched longtimes the head, the eyes fixed upon <lb/>
Daniel, until that which at last he said:</q>
<q>"I me demand how the devil it makes itself that this beast has refused. <lb/>
Is it that she had something? One would believe that she is stuffed."</q>
<q>He grasped Daniel by the skin of the neck, him lifted and said:</q>
<q>"The wolf me bite if he no weigh not five pounds."</q>
<q>He him reversed and the unhappy belched two handfuls of shot <lb/>
(<foreign lang="fre"><i>et le malheureux</i></foreign>, etc.).&#x2014;When Smiley recognized how it was, he <lb/>
was like mad. He deposited his frog by the earth and ran after that <lb/>
individual, but he not him caught never.</q>
<p>It may be that there are people who can translate <lb/>
better than I can, but I am not acquainted with them.</p>
<p>So ends the private and public history of the <lb/>
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, an incident <lb/>
which has this unique feature about it&#x2014;that it is <lb/>
both old and new, a "chestnut" and not a "chest- <lb/>
nut"; for it was original when it happened two <lb/>
thousand years ago, and was again original when it <lb/>
happened in California in our own time.</p>

<head><b>MENTAL TELEGRAPHY AGAIN</b></head>
<p><smcap>I have</smcap> three or four curious incidents to tell <lb/>
about. They seem to come under the head of <lb/>
what I named "Mental Telegraphy" in a paper <lb/>
written seventeen years ago, and published long <lb/>
afterwards.<ref target="n3">*</ref><note id="n3" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The paper entitled "Mental Telegraphy," which originally appeared <lb/>
in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for December, 1893, is included in the volume <lb/>
entitled <i>The American Claimant and Other Stories and Sketches</i>.</p></note></p>
<p>Several years ago I made a campaign on the plat- <lb/>
form with Mr. George W. Cable. In Montreal we <lb/>
were honored with a reception. It began at two in <lb/>
the afternoon in a long drawing-room in the Wind- <lb/>
sor Hotel. Mr. Cable and I stood at one end of this <lb/>
room, and the ladies and gentlemen entered it at the <lb/>
other end, crossed it at that end, then came up the <lb/>
long left-hand side, shook hands with us, said a <lb/>
word or two, and passed on, in the usual way. My <lb/>
sight is of the telescopic sort, and I presently recog- <lb/>
nized a familiar face among the throng of strangers <lb/>
drifting in at the distant door, and I said to myself, <lb/>
with surprise and high gratification, "That is Mrs. <lb/>
R.; I had forgotten that she was a Canadian." She <lb/>
had been a great friend of mine in Carson City, <lb/>
Nevada, in the early days. I had not seen her or <lb/>
<pb n="132"/>
heard of her for twenty years; I had not been <lb/>
thinking about her; there was nothing to suggest <lb/>
her to me, nothing to bring her to my mind; in <lb/>
fact, to me she had long ago ceased to exist, and <lb/>
had disappeared from my consciousness. But I <lb/>
knew her instantly; and I saw her so clearly that I <lb/>
was able to note some of the particulars of her dress, <lb/>
and did note them, and they remained in my mind. <lb/>
I was impatient for her to come. In the midst of <lb/>
the hand-shakings I snatched glimpses of her and <lb/>
noted her progress with the slow-moving file across <lb/>
the end of the room; then I saw her start up the <lb/>
side, and this gave me a full front view of her face. <lb/>
I saw her last when she was within twenty-five feet <lb/>
of me. For an hour I kept thinking she must still <lb/>
be in the room somewhere and would come at last, <lb/>
but I was disappointed.</p>
<p>When I arrived in the lecture-hall that evening <lb/>
some one said: "Come into the waiting-room; <lb/>
there's a friend of yours there who wants to see <lb/>
you. You'll not be introduced&#x2014;you are to do the <lb/>
recognizing without help if you can."</p>
<p>I said to myself: "It is Mrs. R.; I shan't have <lb/>
any trouble."</p>
<p>There were perhaps ten ladies present, all seated. <lb/>
In the midst of them was Mrs. R., as I had ex- <lb/>
pected. She was dressed exactly as she was when I <lb/>
had seen her in the afternoon. I went forward and <lb/>
shook hands with her and called her by name, and <lb/>
said:</p>
<pb n="133"/>
<p>"I knew you the moment you appeared at the <lb/>
reception this afternoon."</p>
<p>She looked surprised, and said: "But I was not <lb/>
at the reception. I have just arrived from Quebec, <lb/>
and have not been in town an hour."</p>
<p>It was my turn to be surprised now. I said: "I <lb/>
can't help it. I give you my word of honor that it <lb/>
is as I say. I saw you at the reception, and you <lb/>
were dressed precisely as you are now. When they <lb/>
told me a moment ago that I should find a friend in <lb/>
this room, your image rose before me, dress and <lb/>
all, just as I had seen you at the reception."</p>
<p>Those are the facts. She was not at the reception <lb/>
at all, or anywhere near it; but I saw her there never- <lb/>
theless, and most clearly and unmistakably. To that <lb/>
I could make oath. How is one to explain this? I <lb/>
was not thinking of her at the time; had not thought <lb/>
of her for years. But she had been thinking of me, <lb/>
no doubt; did her thoughts flit through leagues of <lb/>
air to me, and bring with it that clear and pleasant <lb/>
vision of herself? I think so. That was and remains <lb/>
my sole experience in the matter of apparitions&#x2014;I <lb/>
mean apparitions that come when one is (ostensibly) <lb/>
awake. I could have been asleep for a moment; <lb/>
the apparition could have been the creature of a <lb/>
dream. Still, that is nothing to the point; the <lb/>
feature of interest is the happening of the thing just <lb/>
at that time, instead of at an earlier or later time, <lb/>
which is argument that its origin lay in thought- <lb/>
transference.</p>
<pb n="134"/>
<p>My next incident will be set aside by most persons <lb/>
as being merely a "coincidence," I suppose. Years <lb/>
ago I used to think sometimes of making a lecturing <lb/>
trip through the antipodes and the borders of the <lb/>
Orient, but always gave up the idea, partly because <lb/>
of the great length of the journey and partly because <lb/>
my wife could not well manage to go with me. <lb/>
Towards the end of last January that idea, after an <lb/>
interval of years, came suddenly into my head again <lb/>
&#x2014;forcefully, too, and without any apparent reason. <lb/>
Whence came it? What suggested it? I will touch <lb/>
upon that presently.</p>
<p>I was at that time where I am now&#x2014;in Paris. I <lb/>
wrote at once to Henry M. Stanley (London), and <lb/>
asked him some questions about his Australian lec- <lb/>
ture tour, and inquired who had conducted him and <lb/>
what were the terms. After a day or two his answer <lb/>
came. It began: <lb/>
<q>"The lecture agent for Australia and New Zealand is <i>par excellence</i> <lb/>
Mr. R. S. Smythe, of Melbourne."</q></p>
<p>He added his itinerary, terms, sea expenses, and <lb/>
some other matters, and advised me to write Mr. <lb/>
Smythe, which I did&#x2014;February 3d. I began my <lb/>
letter by saying in substance that while he did not <lb/>
know me personally we had a mutual friend in <lb/>
Stanley, and that would answer for an introduction. <lb/>
Then I proposed my trip, and asked if he would give <lb/>
me the same terms which he had given Stanley.</p>
<p>I mailed my letter to Mr. Smythe February 6th, <lb/>
and three days later I got a letter from the selfsame <lb/>
<pb n="135"/>
Smythe, dated Melbourne, December 17th. I would <lb/>
as soon have expected to get a letter from the late <lb/>
George Washington. The letter began somewhat <lb/>
as mine to him had begun&#x2014;with a self-introduction: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>Dear Mr. Clemens</smcap>,&#x2014;It is so long since Archibald Forbes and <lb/>
I spent that pleasant afternoon in your comfortable house at Hartford <lb/>
that you have probably quite forgotten the occasion."</q></p>
<p>In the course of his letter this occurs: <lb/>
<q>"I am willing to give you" [here he named the terms which he had <lb/>
given Stanley] "for an antipodean tour to last, say, three months."</q></p>
<p>Here was the single essential detail of my letter <lb/>
answered three days after I had mailed my inquiry. <lb/>
I might have saved myself the trouble and the postage <lb/>
&#x2014;and a few years ago I would have done that very <lb/>
thing, for I would have argued that my sudden and <lb/>
strong impulse to write and ask some questions of a <lb/>
stranger on the under side of the globe meant that <lb/>
the impulse came from that stranger, and that he <lb/>
would answer my questions of his own motion if I <lb/>
would let him alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Smythe's letter probably passed under my <lb/>
nose on its way to lose three weeks traveling to <lb/>
America and back, and gave me a whiff of its con- <lb/>
tents as it went along. Letters often act like that. <lb/>
Instead of the <i>thought</i> coming to you in an instant <lb/>
from Australia, the (apparently) unsentient letter <lb/>
imparts it to you as it glides invisibly past your <lb/>
elbow in the mail-bag.</p>
<p>Next incident. In the following month&#x2014;March <lb/>
&#x2014;I was in America. I spent a Sunday at Irvington- <lb/>
<pb n="136"/>
on-the-Hudson with Mr. John Brisben Walker, of <lb/>
the <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine. We came into New <lb/>
York next morning, and went to the Century Club <lb/>
for luncheon. He said some praiseful things about <lb/>
the character of the club and the orderly serenity and <lb/>
pleasantness of its quarters, and asked if I had never <lb/>
tried to acquire membership in it. I said I had not, <lb/>
and that New York clubs were a continuous expense <lb/>
to the country members without being of frequent <lb/>
use or benefit to them.</p>
<p>"And now I've got an idea!" said I. "There's <lb/>
the Lotos&#x2014;the first New York club I was ever a <lb/>
member of&#x2014;my very earliest love in that line. I <lb/>
have been a member of it for considerably more <lb/>
than twenty years, yet have seldom had a chance to <lb/>
look in and see the boys. They turn gray and grow <lb/>
old while I am not watching. And <i>my dues go on</i>. <lb/>
I am going to Hartford this afternoon for a day or <lb/>
two, but as soon as I get back I will go to John <lb/>
Elderkin very privately and say: 'Remember the <lb/>
veteran and confer distinction upon him, for the <lb/>
sake of old times. Make me an honorary member <lb/>
and abolish the tax. If you haven't any such thing <lb/>
as honorary membership, all the better&#x2014;create it <lb/>
for my honor and glory.' That would be a great <lb/>
thing; I will go to John Elderkin as soon as I get <lb/>
back from Hartford."</p>
<p>I took the last express that afternoon, first tele- <lb/>
graphing Mr. F. G. Whitmore to come and see me <lb/>
next day. When he came he asked:</p>
<pb n="137"/>
<p>"Did you get a letter from Mr. John Elderkin, <lb/>
secretary of the Lotos Club, before you left New <lb/>
York?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then it just missed you. If I had known you <lb/>
were coming I would have kept it. It is beautiful, <lb/>
and will make you proud. The Board of Directors, <lb/>
by unanimous vote, have made you a life member, <lb/>
and <i>squelched those dues;</i> and, you are to be on <lb/>
hand and receive your distinction on the night of <lb/>
the 30th, which is the twenty-fifth anniversary of <lb/>
the founding of the club, and it will not surprise me <lb/>
if they have some great times there."</p>
<p>What put the honorary membership in my head <lb/>
that day in the Century Club? for I had never <lb/>
thought of it before. I don't know what brought <lb/>
the thought to me at <i>that</i> particular time instead of <lb/>
earlier, but I am well satisfied that it originated with <lb/>
the Board of Directors, and had been on its way to <lb/>
my brain through the air ever since the moment that <lb/>
saw their vote recorded.</p>
<p>Another incident. I was in Hartford two or three <lb/>
days as a guest of the Rev. Joseph H. Twichell. I <lb/>
have held the rank of Honorary Uncle to his chil- <lb/>
dren for a quarter of a century, and I went out with <lb/>
him in the trolley-car to visit one of my nieces, who <lb/>
is at Miss Porter's famous school in Farmington. <lb/>
The distance is eight or nine miles. On the way, <lb/>
talking, I illustrated something with an anecdote. <lb/>
This is the anecdote:</p>
<pb n="138"/>
<p>Two years and a half ago I and the family arrived <lb/>
at Milan on our way to Rome, and stopped at the <lb/>
Continental. After dinner I went below and took a <lb/>
seat in the stone-paved court, where the customary <lb/>
lemon-trees stand in the customary tubs, and said to <lb/>
myself, "Now <i>this</i> is comfort, comfort and repose, <lb/>
and nobody to disturb it; I do not know anybody <lb/>
in Milan."</p>
<p>Then a young gentleman stepped up and shook <lb/>
hands, which damaged my theory. He said, in <lb/>
substance:</p>
<p>"You won't remember me, Mr. Clemens, but I <lb/>
remember you very well. I was a cadet at West <lb/>
Point when you and Rev. Joseph H. Twichell came <lb/>
there some years ago and talked to us on a Hun- <lb/>
dredth Night. I am a lieutenant in the regular army <lb/>
now, and my name is H. I am in Europe, all <lb/>
alone, for a modest little tour; my regiment is in <lb/>
Arizona."</p>
<p>We became friendly and sociable, and in the <lb/>
course of the talk he told me of an adventure which <lb/>
had befallen him&#x2014;about to this effect:</p>
<p>"I was at Bellagio, stopping at the big hotel <lb/>
there, and ten days ago I lost my letter of credit. I <lb/>
did not know what in the world to do. I was a <lb/>
stranger; I knew no one in Europe; I hadn't a <lb/>
penny in my pocket; I couldn't even send a tele- <lb/>
gram to London to get my lost letter replaced; my <lb/>
hotel bill was a week old, and the presentation of it <lb/>
imminent&#x2014;so imminent that it could happen at <lb/>
<pb n="139"/>
any moment now. I was so frightened that my wits <lb/>
seemed to leave me. I tramped and tramped, back <lb/>
and forth, like a crazy person. If anybody ap- <lb/>
proached me I hurried away, for no matter what a <lb/>
person looked like, I took him for the head waiter <lb/>
with the bill.</p>
<p>"I was at last in such a desperate state that I was <lb/>
ready to do any wild thing that promised even the <lb/>
shadow of help, and so this is the insane thing that <lb/>
I did. I saw a family lunching at a small table on <lb/>
the veranda, and recognized their nationality&#x2014; <lb/>
Americans&#x2014;father, mother, and several young <lb/>
daughters&#x2014;young, tastefully dressed, and pretty <lb/>
&#x2014;the rule with our people. I went straight there <lb/>
in my civilian costume, named my name, said I was <lb/>
a lieutenant in the army, and told my story and <lb/>
asked for help.</p>
<p>"What do you suppose the gentleman did? But <lb/>
you would not guess in twenty years. He took <lb/>
out a handful of gold coin and told me to help <lb/>
myself&#x2014;freely. That is what he did."</p>
<p>The next morning the lieutenant told me his <lb/>
new letter of credit had arrived in the night, so we <lb/>
strolled to Cook's to draw money to pay back the <lb/>
benefactor with. We got it, and then went strolling <lb/>
through the great arcade. Presently he said, "Yon- <lb/>
der they are; come and be introduced." I was <lb/>
introduced to the parents and the young ladies; <lb/>
then we separated, and I never saw him or them any <lb/>
m&#x2014;</p>
<pb n="140"/>
<p>"Here we are at Farmington," said Twichell, <lb/>
interrupting.</p>
<p>We left the trolley-car and tramped through the <lb/>
mud a hundred yards or so to the school, talking <lb/>
about the time we and Warner walked out there <lb/>
years ago, and the pleasant time we had.</p>
<p>We had a visit with my niece in the parlor, then <lb/>
started for the trolley again. Outside the house we <lb/>
encountered a double rank of twenty or thirty of <lb/>
Miss Porter's young ladies arriving from a walk, and <lb/>
we stood aside, ostensibly to let them have room to <lb/>
file past, but really to look at them. Presently one <lb/>
of them stepped out of the rank and said:</p>
<p>"You don't know me, Mr. Twichell, but I know <lb/>
your daughter, and that gives me the privilege of <lb/>
shaking hands with you."</p>
<p>Then she put out her hand to me, and said:</p>
<p>"And I wish to shake hands with you too, Mr. <lb/>
Clemens. You don't remember me, but you were <lb/>
introduced to me in the arcade in Milan two years <lb/>
and a half ago by Lieutenant H."</p>
<p>What had put that story into my head after all <lb/>
that stretch of time? Was it just the proximity of <lb/>
that young girl, or was it merely an odd accident?</p>

<head><b>WHAT PAUL BOURGET THINKS OF US</b></head>
<p><smcap>He</smcap> reports the American joke correctly. In <lb/>
Boston they ask, How much does he know? <lb/>
in New York, How much is he worth? in Philadel- <lb/>
phia, Who were his parents? And when an alien <lb/>
observer turns his telescope upon us&#x2014;advertisedly <lb/>
in our own special interest&#x2014;a natural apprehension <lb/>
moves us to ask, What is the diameter of his <lb/>
reflector?</p>
<p>I take a great interest in M. Bourget's chapters, <lb/>
for I know by the newspapers that there are several <lb/>
Americans who are expecting to get a whole educa- <lb/>
tion out of them; several who foresaw, and also <lb/>
foretold, that our long night was over, and a light <lb/>
almost divine about to break upon the land.</p>
<q>"<i>His utterances concerning us are bound to be weighty and well <lb/>
timed</i>."</q>
<q>"<i>He gives us an object-lesson which should be thoughtfully and <lb/>
profitably studied</i>."</q>
<p>These well-considered and important verdicts were <lb/>
of a nature to restore public confidence, which had <lb/>
been disquieted by questionings as to whether so <lb/>
young a teacher would be qualified to take so large <lb/>
a class as 70,000,000, distributed over so extensive <lb/>
<pb n="142"/>
a schoolhouse as America, and pull it through with- <lb/>
out assistance.</p>
<p>I was even disquieted myself, although I am of a <lb/>
cold, calm temperament, and not easily disturbed. <lb/>
I feared for my country. And I was not wholly <lb/>
tranquilized by the verdicts rendered as above. It <lb/>
seemed to me that there was still room for doubt. <lb/>
In fact, in looking the ground over I became more <lb/>
disturbed than I was before. Many worrying ques- <lb/>
tions came up in my mind. Two were prominent. <lb/>
Where had the teacher gotten his equipment? What <lb/>
was his method?</p>
<p>He had gotten his equipment in France.</p>
<p>Then as to his method! I saw by his own intima- <lb/>
tions that he was an Observer, and had a System&#x2014; <lb/>
that used by naturalists and other scientists. The <lb/>
naturalist collects many bugs and reptiles and butter- <lb/>
flies and studies their ways a long time patiently. <lb/>
By this means he is presently able to group these <lb/>
creatures into families and subdivisions of families <lb/>
by nice shadings of differences observable in their <lb/>
characters. Then he labels all those shaded bugs <lb/>
and things with nicely descriptive group names, and <lb/>
is now happy, for his great work is completed, and <lb/>
as a result he intimately knows every bug and shade <lb/>
of a bug there, inside and out. It may be true, but <lb/>
a person who was not a naturalist would feel safer <lb/>
about it if he had the opinion of the bug. I think <lb/>
it is a pleasant System, but subject to error.</p>
<p>The Observer of Peoples has to be a Classifier, a <lb/>
<pb n="143"/>
Grouper, a Deducer, a Generalizer, a Psychologizer; <lb/>
and, first and last, a Thinker. He has to be all <lb/>
these, and when he is at home, observing his own <lb/>
folk, he is often able to prove competency. But his- <lb/>
tory has shown that when he is abroad observing <lb/>
unfamiliar peoples the chances are heavily against <lb/>
him. He is then a naturalist observing a bug, with <lb/>
no more than a naturalist's chance of being able <lb/>
to tell the bug anything new about itself, and <lb/>
no more than a naturalist's chance of being able <lb/>
to teach it any new ways which it will prefer to its <lb/>
own.</p>
<p>To return to that first question. M. Bourget, as <lb/>
teacher, would simply be France teaching America. <lb/>
It seemed to me that the outlook was dark&#x2014;almost <lb/>
Egyptian, in fact. What would the new teacher, <lb/>
representing France, teach us? Railroading? No. <lb/>
France knows nothing valuable about railroading. <lb/>
Steamshipping? No. France has no superiorities <lb/>
over us in that matter. Steamboating? No. French <lb/>
steamboating is still of Fulton's date&#x2014;1809. Postal <lb/>
service? No. France is a back number there. <lb/>
Telegraphy? No, we taught her that ourselves. <lb/>
Journalism? No. Magazining? No, that is our <lb/>
own specialty. Government? No; Liberty, Equal- <lb/>
ity, Fraternity, Nobility, Democracy, Adultery&#x2014; <lb/>
the system is too variegated for our climate. <lb/>
Religion? No, not variegated enough for our <lb/>
climate. Morals? No, we cannot rob the poor to <lb/>
enrich ourselves. Novel-writing? No. M. Bour- <lb/>
<pb n="144"/>
get and the others know only one plan, and when <lb/>
that is expurgated there is nothing left of the book.</p>
<p>I wish I could think what he is going to teach us. <lb/>
Can it be Deportment? But he experimented in that <lb/>
at Newport and failed to give satisfaction, except to <lb/>
a few. Those few are pleased. They are enjoying <lb/>
their joy as well as they can. They confess their <lb/>
happiness to the interviewer. They feel pretty <lb/>
striped, but they remember with reverent recog- <lb/>
nition that they had sugar between the cuts. True, <lb/>
sugar with sand in it, but sugar. And true, they <lb/>
had some trouble to tell which was sugar and which <lb/>
was sand, because the sugar itself looked just like the <lb/>
sand, and also had a gravelly taste; still, they knew <lb/>
that the sugar was there, and would have been very <lb/>
good sugar indeed if it had been screened. Yes, <lb/>
they are pleased; not noisily so, but pleased; in- <lb/>
vaded, or streaked, as one may say, with little re- <lb/>
current shivers of joy&#x2014;subdued joy, so to speak, <lb/>
not the overdone kind. And they commune to- <lb/>
gether, these, and massage each other with comfort- <lb/>
ing sayings, in a sweet spirit of resignation and <lb/>
thankfulness, mixing these elements in the same <lb/>
proportions as the sugar and the sand, as a memo- <lb/>
rial, and saying, the one to the other, and to the <lb/>
interviewer: "It was severe&#x2014;yes, it was bitterly <lb/>
severe; but oh, how true it was; and it will do us <lb/>
so much good!"</p>
<p>If it isn't Deportment, what is left? It was at <lb/>
this point that I seemed to get on the right track at <lb/>
<pb n="145"/>
last. M. Bourget would teach us to know ourselves; <lb/>
that was it: he would reveal us to ourselves. That <lb/>
would be an education. He would explain us to <lb/>
ourselves. Then we should understand ourselves; <lb/>
and after that be able to go on more intelligently.</p>
<p>It seemed a doubtful scheme. He could explain <lb/>
<i>us</i> to <i>him</i>self&#x2014;that would be easy. That would <lb/>
be the same as the naturalist explaining the bug to <lb/>
himself. But to explain the bug to the bug&#x2014;that <lb/>
is quite a different matter. The bug may not know <lb/>
himself perfectly, but he knows himself better than <lb/>
the naturalist can know him, at any rate.</p>
<p>A foreigner can photograph the exteriors of a <lb/>
nation, but I think that that is as far as he can get. <lb/>
I think that no foreigner can report its interior&#x2014;its <lb/>
soul, its life, its speech, its thought. I think that a <lb/>
knowledge of these things is acquirable in only one <lb/>
way; not two or four or six&#x2014; <foreign lang="fre"><i>absorption;</i></foreign> years and <lb/>
years of unconscious <foreign lang="fre">absorption;</foreign> years and years <lb/>
of intercourse with the life concerned; of living it, <lb/>
indeed; sharing personally in its shames and prides, <lb/>
its joys and griefs, its loves and hates, its pros- <lb/>
perities and reverses, its shows and shabbinesses, <lb/>
its deep patriotisms, its whirlwinds of political pas- <lb/>
sion, its adorations&#x2014;of flag, and heroic dead, and <lb/>
the glory of the national name. Observation? Of <lb/>
what real value is it? One learns peoples through <lb/>
the heart, not the eyes or the intellect.</p>
<p>There is only one expert who is qualified to ex- <lb/>
amine the souls and the life of a people and make a <lb/>
<pb n="146"/>
valuable report&#x2014;the native novelist. This expert is <lb/>
so rare that the most populous country can never <lb/>
have fifteen conspicuously and confessedly competent <lb/>
ones in stock at one time. This native specialist is <lb/>
not qualified to begin work until he has been absorb- <lb/>
ing during twenty-five years. How much of his <lb/>
competency is derived from conscious "observa- <lb/>
tion"? The amount is so slight that it counts for <lb/>
next to nothing in the equipment. Almost the <lb/>
whole capital of the novelist is the slow accumula- <lb/>
tion of <i>un</i>conscious observation&#x2014;<foreign lang="fre">absorption</foreign>. The <lb/>
native expert's intentional observation of manners, <lb/>
speech, character, and ways of life can have value, <lb/>
for the native knows what they mean without having <lb/>
to cipher out the meaning. But I should be aston- <lb/>
ished to see a foreigner get at the right meanings, <lb/>
catch the elusive shades of these subtle things. <lb/>
Even the native novelist becomes a foreigner, with a <lb/>
foreigner's limitations, when he steps from the State <lb/>
whose life is familiar to him into a State whose life <lb/>
he has not lived. Bret Harte got his California and <lb/>
his Californians by unconscious absorption, and put <lb/>
both of them into his tales alive. But when he <lb/>
came from the Pacific to the Atlantic and tried to <lb/>
do Newport life from study&#x2014;conscious observa- <lb/>
tion&#x2014;his failure was absolutely monumental. <lb/>
Newport is a disastrous place for the unacclimated <lb/>
observer, evidently.</p>
<p>To return to novel-building. Does the native <lb/>
novelist try to generalize the nation? No, he lays <lb/>
<pb n="147"/>
plainly before you the ways and speech and life of a <lb/>
few people grouped in a certain place&#x2014;his own <lb/>
place&#x2014;and that is one book. In time he and his <lb/>
brethren will report to you the life and the people <lb/>
of the whole nation&#x2014;the life of a group in a New <lb/>
England village; in a New York village; in a Texan <lb/>
village; in an Oregon village; in villages in fifty <lb/>
States and Territories; then the farm-life in fifty <lb/>
States and Territories; a hundred patches of life <lb/>
and groups of people in a dozen widely separated <lb/>
cities. And the Indians will be attended to; and <lb/>
the cowboys; and the gold and silver miners; and <lb/>
the negroes; and the Idiots and Congressmen; and <lb/>
the Irish, the Germans, the Italians, the Swedes, <lb/>
the French, the Chinamen, the Greasers; and the <lb/>
Catholics, the Methodists, the Presbyterians, the <lb/>
Congregationalists, the Baptists, the Spiritualists, <lb/>
the Mormons, the Shakers, the Quakers, the Jews, <lb/>
the Campbellites, the infidels, the Christian Scien- <lb/>
tists, the Mind-Curists, the Faith-Curists, the train- <lb/>
robbers, the White Caps, the Moonshiners. And <lb/>
when a thousand able novels have been written, <lb/>
<i>there</i> you have the soul of the people, the life of <lb/>
the people, the speech of the people; and not any- <lb/>
where else can these be had. And the shadings of <lb/>
character, manners, feelings, ambitions, will be <lb/>
infinite.</p>
<q>"<i>The nature of a people</i> is always of a similar shade in its vices and <lb/>
its virtues, in its frivolities and in its labor. <i>It is this physiognomy <lb/>
which it is necessary to discover</i>, and every document is good, from the <lb/>
<pb n="148"/>
hall of a casino to the church, from the foibles of a fashionable woman <lb/>
to the suggestions of a revolutionary leader. I am therefore quite sure <lb/>
that this <i>American soul</i>, the principal interest and the great object of <lb/>
my voyage, appears behind the records of Newport for those who choose <lb/>
to see it."&#x2014;<i>M. Paul Bourget</i>.</q>
<p>[The italics are mine.] It is a large contract <lb/>
which he has undertaken. "Records" is a pretty <lb/>
poor word there, but I think the use of it is due to <lb/>
hasty translation. In the original the word is <i>fastes</i>. <lb/>
I think M. Bourget meant to suggest that he ex- <lb/>
pected to find the great "American soul" secreted <lb/>
behind the <i>ostentations</i> of Newport; and that he <lb/>
was going to get it out and examine it, and general- <lb/>
ize it, and psychologize it, and make it reveal to <lb/>
him its hidden vast mystery: "the nature of the <lb/>
people" of the United States of America. We <lb/>
have been accused of being a nation addicted to <lb/>
inventing wild schemes. I trust that we shall be <lb/>
allowed to retire to second place now.</p>
<p>There isn't a single human characteristic that can <lb/>
be safely labeled "American." There isn't a single <lb/>
human ambition, or religious trend, or drift of <lb/>
thought, or peculiarity of education, or code of <lb/>
principles, or breed of folly, or style of conversa- <lb/>
tion, or preference for a particular subject for dis- <lb/>
cussion, or form of legs or trunk or head or face or <lb/>
expression or complexion, or gait, or dress, or <lb/>
manners, or disposition, or any other human detail, <lb/>
inside or outside, that can rationally be generalized <lb/>
as "American."</p>
<p>Whenever you have found what seems to be an <lb/>
<pb n="149"/>
"American" peculiarity, you have only to cross a <lb/>
frontier or two, or go down or up in the social scale, <lb/>
and you perceive that it has disappeared. And you <lb/>
can cross the Atlantic and find it again. There <lb/>
may be a Newport religious drift, or sporting drift, <lb/>
or conversational style or complexion, or cut of <lb/>
face, but there are entire empires in America, north, <lb/>
south, east, and west, where you could not find <lb/>
your duplicates. It is the same with everything <lb/>
else which one might propose to call "American." <lb/>
M. Bourget thinks he has found the American <lb/>
Coquette. If he had really found her he would also <lb/>
have found, I am sure, that she was not new, that <lb/>
she exists in other lands in the same forms, and <lb/>
with the same frivolous heart and the same ways <lb/>
and impulses. I think this because I have seen our <lb/>
coquette; I have seen her in life; better still, I have <lb/>
seen her in our novels, and seen her twin in foreign <lb/>
novels. I wish M. Bourget had seen ours. He <lb/>
thought he saw her. And so he applied his System <lb/>
to her. She was a Species. So he gathered a <lb/>
number of samples of what seemed to be her, and <lb/>
put them under his glass, and divided them into <lb/>
groups which he calls "types," and labeled them in <lb/>
his usual scientific way with "formulas"&#x2014;brief <lb/>
sharp descriptive flashes that make a person blink, <lb/>
sometimes, they are so sudden and vivid. As a <lb/>
rule they are pretty far-fetched, but that is not an <lb/>
important matter; they surprise, they compel ad- <lb/>
miration, and I notice by some of the comments <lb/>
<pb n="150"/>
which his efforts have called forth that they deceive <lb/>
the unwary. Here are a few of the coquette variants <lb/>
which he has grouped and labeled:</p>
<list>
<item><smcap>The Collector</smcap>.</item>
<item><smcap>The Equilibree</smcap>.</item>
<item><smcap>The Professional Beauty</smcap>.</item>
<item><smcap>The Bluffer</smcap>.</item>
<item><smcap>The Girl-Boy</smcap>.</item>
</list>
<p>If he had stopped with describing these characters <lb/>
we should have been obliged to believe that they <lb/>
exist; that they exist, and that he has seen them and <lb/>
spoken with them. But he did not stop there; he <lb/>
went further and furnished to us light-throwing <lb/>
samples of their behavior, and also light-throwing <lb/>
samples of their speeches. He entered those things <lb/>
in his note-book without suspicion, he takes them <lb/>
out and delivers them to the world with a candor <lb/>
and simplicity which show that he believed them <lb/>
genuine. They throw altogether too much light. <lb/>
They reveal to the native the origin of his find. I <lb/>
suppose he knows how he came to make that novel <lb/>
and captivating discovery, by this time. If he <lb/>
does not, any American can tell him&#x2014;any Ameri- <lb/>
can to whom he will show his anecdotes. It was <lb/>
"put up" on him, as we say. It was a jest&#x2014;to <lb/>
be plain, it was a series of frauds. To my mind it <lb/>
was a poor sort of jest, witless and contemptible. <lb/>
The players of it have their reward, such as it is; <lb/>
they have exhibited the fact that whatever they may <lb/>
be they are not ladies. M. Bourget did not discover <lb/>
<pb n="151"/>
a type of coquette; he merely discovered a type of <lb/>
practical joker. One may say <i>the</i> type of practical <lb/>
joker, for these people are exactly alike all over the <lb/>
world. Their equipment is always the same: a <lb/>
vulgar mind, a puerile wit, a cruel disposition as a <lb/>
rule, and always the spirit of treachery.</p>
<p>In his Chapter IV. M. Bourget has two or three <lb/>
columns gravely devoted to the collating and ex- <lb/>
amining and psychologizing of these sorry little <lb/>
frauds. One is not moved to laugh. There is <lb/>
nothing funny in the situation; it is only pathetic. <lb/>
The stranger gave those people his confidence, and <lb/>
they dishonorably treated him in return.</p>
<p>But one must be allowed to suspect that M. <lb/>
Bourget was a little to blame himself. Even a <lb/>
practical joker has some little judgment. He has <lb/>
to exercise some degree of sagacity in selecting his <lb/>
prey if he would save himself from getting into <lb/>
trouble. In my time I have seldom seen such daring <lb/>
things marketed at any price as these conscienceless <lb/>
folk have worked off at par on this confiding ob- <lb/>
server. It compels the conviction that there was <lb/>
something about him that bred in those speculators <lb/>
a quite unusual sense of safety, and encouraged <lb/>
them to strain their powers in his behalf. They <lb/>
seem to have satisfied themselves that all he wanted <lb/>
was "significant" facts, and that he was not accus- <lb/>
tomed to examine the source whence they pro- <lb/>
ceeded. It is plain that there was a sort of con- <lb/>
spiracy against him almost from the start&#x2014;a <lb/>
<pb n="152"/>
conspiracy to freight him up with all the strange <lb/>
extravagances those people's decayed brains could <lb/>
invent.</p>
<p>The lengths to which they went are next to <lb/>
incredible. They told him things which surely <lb/>
would have excited any one else's suspicion, but <lb/>
they did not excite his. Consider this: <lb/>
<q>"<i>There is not in all the United States an entirely nude statue</i>."</q></p>
<p>If an angel should come down and say such a <lb/>
thing about heaven, a reasonably cautious observer <lb/>
would take that angel's number and inquire a little <lb/>
further before he added it to his catch. What does <lb/>
the present observer do? Adds it. Adds it at once. <lb/>
Adds it, and labels it with this innocent comment: <lb/>
<q>"<i>This small fact is strangely significant</i>."</q>
It does seem to me that this kind of observing is <lb/>
defective.</p>
<p>Here is another curiosity which some liberal <lb/>
person made him a present of. I should think it <lb/>
ought to have disturbed the deep slumber of his <lb/>
suspicion a little, but it didn't. It was a note from <lb/>
a fog-horn for strenuousness, it seems to me, but <lb/>
the doomed voyager did not catch it. If he had but <lb/>
caught it, it would have saved him from several <lb/>
disasters: <lb/>
<q>"If the American knows that you are traveling to take notes, he is <lb/>
interested in it, and at the same time rejoices in it, as in a tribute."</q></p>
<p>Again, this is defective observation. It is human <lb/>
to like to be praised; one can even notice it in the <lb/>
<pb n="153"/>
French. But it is not human to like to be ridiculed, <lb/>
even when it comes in the form of a "tribute." I <lb/>
think a little psychologizing ought to have come in <lb/>
there. Something like this: A dog does not like to <lb/>
be ridiculed, a redskin does not like to be ridiculed, <lb/>
a negro does not like to be ridiculed, a Chinaman <lb/>
does not like to be ridiculed; let us deduce from <lb/>
these significant facts this formula: the American's <lb/>
grade being higher than these, and the chain of <lb/>
argument stretching unbroken all the way up to him, <lb/>
there is room for suspicion that the person who said <lb/>
the American likes to be ridiculed, and regards it as <lb/>
a tribute, is not a capable observer.</p>
<p>I feel persuaded that in the matter of psycholo- <lb/>
gizing, a professional is too apt to yield to the fasci- <lb/>
nations of the loftier regions of that great art, to the <lb/>
neglect of its lowlier walks. Every now and then, <lb/>
at half-hour intervals, M. Bourget collects a hatful <lb/>
of airy inaccuracies and dissolves them in a panful <lb/>
of assorted abstractions, and runs the charge into <lb/>
a mould and turns you out a compact principle <lb/>
which will explain an American girl, or an Amer- <lb/>
ican woman, or why new people yearn for old <lb/>
things, or any other impossible riddle which a per- <lb/>
son wants answered.</p>
<p>It seems to be conceded that there are a few <lb/>
human peculiarities that can be generalized and <lb/>
located here and there in the world and named by <lb/>
the name of the nation where they are found. I <lb/>
wonder what they are. Perhaps one of them is <lb/>
<pb n="154"/>
temperament. One speaks of French vivacity and <lb/>
German gravity and English stubbornness. There <lb/>
is no American temperament. The nearest that one <lb/>
can come at it is to say there are two&#x2014;the com- <lb/>
posed Northern and the impetuous Southern; and <lb/>
both are found in other countries. Morals? Purity <lb/>
of women may fairly be called universal with us, <lb/>
but that is the case in some other countries. We <lb/>
have no monopoly of it; it cannot be named Ameri- <lb/>
can. I think that there is but a single specialty with <lb/>
us, only one thing that can be called by the wide <lb/>
name "American." That is the national devotion <lb/>
to ice-water. All Germans drink beer, but the <lb/>
British nation drinks beer, too; so neither of those <lb/>
peoples is <i>the</i> beer-drinking nation. I suppose we <lb/>
do stand alone in having a drink that nobody likes <lb/>
but ourselves. When we have been a month in <lb/>
Europe we lose our craving for it, and we finally <lb/>
tell the hotel folk that they needn't provide it any <lb/>
more. Yet we hardly touch our native shore again, <lb/>
winter or summer, before we are eager for it. The <lb/>
reasons for this state of things have not been <lb/>
psychologized yet. I drop the hint and say no <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>It is my belief that there are some "national" <lb/>
traits and things scattered about the world that are <lb/>
mere superstitions, frauds that have lived so long <lb/>
that they have the solid look of facts. One of them <lb/>
is the dogma that the French are the only chaste <lb/>
people in the world. Ever since I arrived in France <lb/>
<pb n="155"/>
this last time I have been accumulating doubts about <lb/>
that; and before I leave this sunny land again I will <lb/>
gather in a few random statistics and psychologize <lb/>
the plausibilities out of it. If people are to come <lb/>
over to America and find fault with our girls and <lb/>
our women, and psychologize every little thing they <lb/>
do, and try to teach them how to behave, and how <lb/>
to cultivate themselves up to where one cannot tell <lb/>
them from the French model, I intend to find out <lb/>
whether those missionaries are qualified or not. A <lb/>
nation ought always to examine into this detail <lb/>
before engaging the teacher for good. This last one <lb/>
has let fall a remark which renewed those doubts of <lb/>
mine when I read it: <lb/>
<q>"In our high Parisian existence, for instance, we find applied to arts <lb/>
and luxury, and to debauchery, all the powers and all the weaknesses of <lb/>
the French soul."</q></p>
<p>You see, it amounts to a trade with the French <lb/>
soul; a profession; a science; the serious business <lb/>
of life, so to speak, in our high Parisian existence. <lb/>
I do not quite like the look of it. I question if <lb/>
it can be taught with profit in our country, ex- <lb/>
cept, of course, to those pathetic, neglected minds <lb/>
that are waiting there so yearningly for the educa- <lb/>
tion which M. Bourget is going to furnish them <lb/>
from the serene summits of our high Parisian life.</p>
<p>I spoke a moment ago of the existence of some <lb/>
superstitions that have been parading the world as <lb/>
facts this long time. For instance, consider the <lb/>
Dollar. The world seems to think that the love of <lb/>
<pb n="156"/>
money is "American"; and that the mad desire to <lb/>
get suddenly rich is "American." I believe that <lb/>
both of these things are merely and broadly human, <lb/>
not American monopolies at all. The love of money <lb/>
is natural to all nations, for money is a good and <lb/>
strong friend. I think that this love has existed <lb/>
everywhere, ever since the Bible called it the root of <lb/>
all evil.</p>
<p>I think that the reason why we Americans seem <lb/>
to be so addicted to trying to get rich suddenly is <lb/>
merely because the <i>opportunity</i> to make promising <lb/>
efforts in that direction has offered itself to us with <lb/>
a frequency out of all proportion to the European <lb/>
experience. For eighty years this opportunity has <lb/>
been offering itself in one new town or region after <lb/>
another straight westward, step by step, all the way <lb/>
from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific. When a <lb/>
mechanic could buy ten town lots on tolerably long <lb/>
credit for ten months' savings out of his wages, and <lb/>
reasonably expect to sell them in a couple of years <lb/>
for ten times what he gave for them, it was human <lb/>
for him to try the venture, and he did it no matter <lb/>
what his nationality was. He would have done it in <lb/>
Europe or China if he had had the same chance.</p>
<p>In the flush times in the silver regions a cook or <lb/>
any other humble worker stood a very good chance <lb/>
to get rich out of a trifle of money risked in a stock <lb/>
deal; and that person promptly took that risk, no <lb/>
matter what his or her nationality might be. I was <lb/>
there, and saw it.</p>
<pb n="157"/>
<p>But these opportunities have not been plenty in <lb/>
our Southern States; so there you have a prodigious <lb/>
region where the rush for sudden wealth is almost an <lb/>
unknown thing&#x2014;and has been, from the beginning.</p>
<p>Europe has offered few opportunities for poor <lb/>
Tom, Dick, and Harry; but when she has offered <lb/>
one, there has been no noticeable difference between <lb/>
European eagerness and American. England saw <lb/>
this in the wild days of the Railroad King; France <lb/>
saw it in 1720&#x2014;time of Law and the Mississippi <lb/>
Bubble. I am sure I have never seen in the gold <lb/>
and silver mines any madness, fury, frenzy to get <lb/>
suddenly rich which was even remotely comparable <lb/>
to that which raged in France in the Bubble day. <lb/>
If I had a cyclop&#x00E6;dia here I could turn to that <lb/>
memorable case, and satisfy nearly anybody that the <lb/>
hunger for the sudden dollar is no more "Ameri- <lb/>
can" than it is French. And if I could furnish an <lb/>
American opportunity to staid Germany, I think I <lb/>
could wake her up like a house afire.</p>
<p>But I must return to the Generalizations, Psychol- <lb/>
ogizings, Deductions. When M. Bourget is ex- <lb/>
ploiting these arts, it is then that he is peculiarly and <lb/>
particularly himself. His ways are wholly original <lb/>
when he encounters a trait or a custom which is new <lb/>
to him. Another person would merely examine the <lb/>
find, verify it, estimate its value, and let it go; but <lb/>
that is not sufficient for M. Bourget: he always <lb/>
wants to know <i>why</i> that thing exists, he wants to <lb/>
know how it came to happen; and he will not let go <lb/>
<pb n="158"/>
of it until he has found out. And in every instance <lb/>
he will find that reason where no one but himself <lb/>
would have thought of looking for it. He does not <lb/>
seem to care for a reason that is not picturesquely <lb/>
located; one might almost say picturesquely and <lb/>
impossibly located.</p>
<p>He found out that in America men do not try to <lb/>
hunt down young married women. At once, as <lb/>
usual, he wanted to know <i>why</i>. Any one could <lb/>
have told him. He could have divined it by the <lb/>
lights thrown by the novels of the country. But <lb/>
no, he preferred to find out for himself. He has a <lb/>
trustfulness as regards men and facts which is fine <lb/>
and unusual; he is not particular about the source <lb/>
of a fact, he is not particular about the character <lb/>
and standing of the fact itself; but when it comes to <lb/>
pounding out the reason for the existence of the <lb/>
fact, he will trust no one but himself.</p>
<p>In the present instance here was his fact: Ameri- <lb/>
can young married women are not pursued by the <lb/>
corruptor; and here was the question: What is it <lb/>
that protects her?</p>
<p>It seems quite unlikely that that problem could <lb/>
have offered difficulties to any but a trained philoso- <lb/>
pher. Nearly any person would have said to M. <lb/>
Bourget: "Oh, that is very simple. It is very <lb/>
seldom in America that a marriage is made on a <lb/>
commercial basis; our marriages, from the begin- <lb/>
ning, have been made for love; and where love is <lb/>
there is no room for the corruptor."</p>
<pb n="159"/>
<p>Now, it is interesting to see the formidable way <lb/>
in which M. Bourget went at that poor, humble <lb/>
little thing. He moved upon it in column&#x2014;three <lb/>
columns&#x2014;and with artillery.</p>
<p>"Two reasons of a very different kind explain" <lb/>
&#x2014;that fact.</p>
<p>And now that I have got so far, I am almost afraid <lb/>
to say what his two reasons are, lest I be charged <lb/>
with inventing them. But I will not retreat now; I <lb/>
will condense them and print them, giving my word <lb/>
that I am honest and not trying to deceive any one.</p>
<p>1. Young married women are protected from the <lb/>
approaches of the seducer in New England and <lb/>
vicinity by the diluted remains of a prudence created <lb/>
by a Puritan law of two hundred years ago, which <lb/>
for a while punished adultery with death.</p>
<p>2. And young married women of the other forty <lb/>
or fifty States are protected by laws which afford <lb/>
extraordinary facilities for divorce.</p>
<p>If I have not lost my mind I have accurately con- <lb/>
veyed those two Vesuvian irruptions of philosophy. <lb/>
But the reader can consult Chapter IV. of <i>Outre- <lb/>
Mer</i>, and decide for himself. Let us examine this <lb/>
paralyzing Deduction or Explanation by the light <lb/>
of a few sane facts.</p>
<p>1. This universality of "protection" has existed <lb/>
in our country <i>from the beginning;</i> before the <lb/>
death penalty existed in New England, and during <lb/>
all the generations that have dragged by since it <lb/>
was annulled.</p>
<pb n="160"/>
<p>2. Extraordinary facilities for divorce are of such <lb/>
recent creation that any middle-aged American can <lb/>
remember a time when such things had not yet been <lb/>
thought of.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that the first easy divorce law <lb/>
went into effect forty years ago, and got noised <lb/>
around and fairly started in business thirty-five years <lb/>
ago, when we had, say, 25,000,000 of white popu- <lb/>
lation. Let us suppose that among 5,000,000 of <lb/>
them the young married women were "protected" <lb/>
by the surviving shudder of that ancient Puritan <lb/>
scare&#x2014;what is M. Bourget going to do about those <lb/>
who lived among the 20,000,000? They were clean <lb/>
in their morals, they were pure, yet there was no <lb/>
easy divorce law to protect them.</p>
<p>Awhile ago I said that M. Bourget's method of <lb/>
truth-seeking&#x2014;hunting for it in out-of-the-way <lb/>
places&#x2014;was new; but that was an error. I re- <lb/>
member that when Leverrier discovered the Milky <lb/>
Way, he and the other astronomers began to theorize <lb/>
about it in substantially the same fashion which M. <lb/>
Bourget employs in his reasonings about American <lb/>
social facts and their origin. Leverrier advanced <lb/>
the hypothesis that the Milky Way was caused by <lb/>
gaseous protoplasmic emanations from the field of <lb/>
Waterloo, which, ascending to an altitude determin- <lb/>
able by their own specific gravity, became luminous <lb/>
through the development and exposure&#x2014;by the <lb/>
natural processes of animal decay&#x2014;of the phos- <lb/>
phorus contained in them.</p>
<pb n="161"/>
<p>This theory was warmly complimented by Ptolemy, <lb/>
who, however, after much thought and research, <lb/>
decided that he could not accept it as final. His <lb/>
own theory was that the Milky Way was an emigra- <lb/>
tion of lightning bugs; and he supported and rein- <lb/>
forced this theorem by the well-known fact that the <lb/>
locusts do like that in Egypt.</p>
<p>Giordano Bruno also was outspoken in his praises <lb/>
of Leverrier's important contribution to astronomical <lb/>
science, and was at first inclined to regard it as con- <lb/>
clusive; but later, conceiving it to be erroneous, he <lb/>
pronounced against it, and advanced the hypothesis <lb/>
that the Milky Way was a detachment or corps of <lb/>
stars which became arrested and held in <i>suspenso <lb/>
suspensorum</i> by refraction of gravitation while on <lb/>
the march to join their several constellations; a <lb/>
proposition for which he was afterwards burned at <lb/>
the stake in Jacksonville, Illinois.</p>
<p>These were all brilliant and picturesque theories, <lb/>
and each was received with enthusiasm by the scien- <lb/>
tific world; but when a New England farmer, who <lb/>
was not a thinker, but only a plain sort of person <lb/>
who tried to account for large facts in simple ways, <lb/>
came out with the opinion that the Milky Way was <lb/>
just common, ordinary stars, and was put where it <lb/>
was because God "wanted to hev it so," the ad- <lb/>
mirable idea fell perfectly flat.</p>
<p>As a literary artist, M. Bourget is as fresh and <lb/>
striking as he is as a scientific one. He says, <lb/>
"Above all, I do not believe much in anecdotes." <lb/>
<pb n="162"/>
Why? "In history they are all false"&#x2014;a suffi- <lb/>
ciently broad statement&#x2014;"in literature all libel- <lb/>
ous"&#x2014;also a sufficiently sweeping statement, <lb/>
coming from a critic who notes that we are a <lb/>
people who are peculiarly extravagant in our lan- <lb/>
guage&#x2014;"and when it is a matter of social life, <lb/>
almost all biased." It seems to amount to stultifi- <lb/>
cation, almost. He has built two or three breeds <lb/>
of American coquettes out of anecdotes&#x2014;mainly <lb/>
"biased" ones, I suppose; and, as they occur <lb/>
"in literature," furnished by his pen, they must be <lb/>
"all libelous." Or did he mean not <i>in</i> literature <lb/>
or anecdotes <i>about</i> literature or literary people? I <lb/>
am not able to answer that. Perhaps the original <lb/>
would be clearer, but I have only the translation of <lb/>
this installment by me. I think the remark had an <lb/>
intention; also that this intention was booked for <lb/>
the trip; but that either in the hurry of the remark's <lb/>
departure it got left, or in the confusion of changing <lb/>
cars at the translator's frontier it got side-tracked.</p>
<p>"But on the other hand I believe in statistics; <lb/>
and those on divorces appear to me to be most con- <lb/>
clusive." And he sets himself the task of explain- <lb/>
ing&#x2014;in a couple of columns&#x2014;the process by <lb/>
which Easy-Divorce conceived, invented, originated, <lb/>
developed, and perfected an empire-embracing con- <lb/>
dition of sexual purity in the States. <i>In 40 years</i>. <lb/>
No, he doesn't state the interval. With all his <lb/>
passion for statistics he forgot to ask how long it <lb/>
took to produce this gigantic miracle.</p>
<pb n="163"/>
<p>I have followed his pleasant but devious trail <lb/>
through those columns, but I was not able to get <lb/>
hold of his argument and find out what it was. I <lb/>
was not even able to find out where it left off. It <lb/>
seemed to gradually dissolve and flow off into other <lb/>
matters. I followed it with interest, for I was <lb/>
anxious to learn how easy-divorce eradicated adul- <lb/>
tery in America, but I was disappointed; I have no <lb/>
idea yet how it did it. I only know it didn't. But <lb/>
that is not valuable; I knew it before.</p>
<p>Well, humor is the great thing, the saving thing, <lb/>
after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses <lb/>
yield, all our irritations and resentments flit away, <lb/>
and a sunny spirit takes their place. And so, when <lb/>
M. Bourget said that bright thing about our grand- <lb/>
fathers, I broke all up. I remember exploding <lb/>
its American countermine once, under that grand <lb/>
hero, Napoleon. He was only First Consul then, <lb/>
and I was Consul-General&#x2014;for the United States, <lb/>
of course; but we were very intimate, notwithstand- <lb/>
ing the difference in rank, for I waived that. One <lb/>
day something offered the opening, and he said:</p>
<p>"Well, General, I suppose life can never get <lb/>
entirely dull to an American, because whenever he <lb/>
can't strike up any other way to put in his time he <lb/>
can always get away with a few years trying to find <lb/>
out who his grandfather was!"</p>
<p>I fairly shouted, for I had never heard it sound <lb/>
better; and then I was back at him as quick as a <lb/>
flash:</p>
<pb n="164"/>
<p>"Right, your Excellency! But I reckon a <lb/>
Frenchman's got <i>his</i> little stand-by for a dull time, <lb/>
too; because when all other interests fail he can <lb/>
turn in and see if he can't find out who his father <lb/>
was!"</p>
<p>Well, you should have heard him just whoop, and <lb/>
cackle, and carry on! He reached up and hit me <lb/>
one on the shoulder, and says:</p>
<p>"Land, but it's good! It's im-mensely good! <lb/>
I'George, I never heard it said so good in my life <lb/>
before! Say it again."</p>
<p>So I said it again, and he said his again, and I <lb/>
said mine again, and then he did, and then I did, <lb/>
and then he did, and we kept on doing it, and doing <lb/>
it, and I <i>never</i> had such a good time, and he said <lb/>
the same. In my opinion there isn't anything that <lb/>
is as killing as one of those dear old ripe pensioners <lb/>
if you know how to snatch it out in a kind of a <lb/>
fresh sort of original way.</p>
<p>But I wish M. Bourget had read more of our <lb/>
novels before he came. It is the only way to <lb/>
thoroughly understand a people. When I found I <lb/>
was coming to Paris, 1 read <i>La Terre</i>.</p>

<head><b>A LITTLE NOTE TO M. PAUL BOURGET</b></head>
<q>[The preceding squib was assailed in the <i>North American Review</i> in <lb/>
an article entitled "Mark Twain and Paul Bourget," by Max O'Rell. <lb/>
The following little note is a Rejoinder to that article. It is possible <lb/>
that the position assumed here&#x2014;that M. Bourget dictated the O'Rell <lb/>
article himself&#x2014;is untenable.]</q>
<p><smcap>You</smcap> have every right, my dear M. Bourget, to <lb/>
retort upon me by dictation, if you prefer that <lb/>
method to writing at me with your pen; but if I <lb/>
may say it without hurt&#x2014;and certainly I mean no <lb/>
offence&#x2014;I believe you would have acquitted your- <lb/>
self better with the pen. With the pen you are at <lb/>
home; it is your natural weapon; you use it with <lb/>
grace, eloquence, charm, persuasiveness, when men <lb/>
are to be convinced, and with formidable effect when <lb/>
they have earned a castigation. But I am sure I see <lb/>
signs in the above article that you are either unac- <lb/>
customed to dictating or are out of practice. If you <lb/>
will re-read it you will notice, yourself, that it lacks <lb/>
definiteness; that it lacks purpose; that it lacks <lb/>
coherence; that it lacks a subject to talk about; <lb/>
that it is loose and wabbly; that it wanders around; <lb/>
that it loses itself early and does not find itself any <lb/>
more. There are some other defects, as you will <lb/>
<pb n="166"/>
notice, but I think I have named the main ones. I <lb/>
feel sure that they are all due to your lack of prac- <lb/>
tice in dictating.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as you had not signed it I had the im- <lb/>
pression at first that you had not dictated it. But <lb/>
only for a moment. Certain quite simple and <lb/>
definite facts reminded me that the article <i>had</i> to <lb/>
come from you, for the reason that it could not <lb/>
come from any one else without a specific invitation <lb/>
from you or from me. I mean, it could not except <lb/>
as an intrusion, a transgression of the law which <lb/>
forbids strangers to mix into a private dispute be- <lb/>
tween friends, unasked.</p>
<p>Those simple and definite facts were these: I had <lb/>
published an article in this magazine, with you for <lb/>
my subject; just you yourself; I stuck strictly to <lb/>
that one subject, and did not interlard any other. <lb/>
No one, of course, could call me to account but you <lb/>
alone, or your authorized representative. I asked <lb/>
some questions&#x2014;asked them of myself. I an- <lb/>
swered them myself. My article was thirteen pages <lb/>
long, and all devoted to you; devoted to you, and <lb/>
divided up in this way: one page of guesses as to <lb/>
what subjects you would instruct us in, as teacher; <lb/>
one page of doubts as to the effectiveness of your <lb/>
method of examining us and our ways; two or three <lb/>
pages of criticism of your method, and of certain <lb/>
results which it furnished you; two or three pages <lb/>
of attempts to show the justness of these same <lb/>
criticisms; half a dozen pages made up of slight <lb/>
<pb n="167"/>
fault-findings with certain minor details of your <lb/>
literary workmanship, of extracts from your <i>Outre- <lb/>
Mer</i> and comments upon them; then I closed with <lb/>
an anecdote. I repeat&#x2014;for certain reasons&#x2014;that <lb/>
<i>I closed with an anecdote</i>.</p>
<p>When I was asked by this magazine if I wished to <lb/>
"answer" a "reply" to that article of mine, I <lb/>
said "yes," and waited in Paris for the proof-sheets <lb/>
of the "reply" to come. I already knew, by the <lb/>
cablegram, that the "reply" would not be signed <lb/>
by you, but upon reflection I knew it would be dic- <lb/>
tated by you, because no volunteer would feel him- <lb/>
self at liberty to assume your championship in a <lb/>
private dispute, unasked, in view of the fact that <lb/>
you are quite well able to take care of your matters <lb/>
of that sort yourself and are not in need of any <lb/>
one's help. No, a volunteer could not make such a <lb/>
venture. It would be too immodest. Also too <lb/>
gratuitously generous. And a shade too self- <lb/>
sufficient. No, he could not venture it. It would <lb/>
look too much like anxiety to get in at a feast <lb/>
where no plate had been provided for him. In fact <lb/>
he could not get in at all, except by the back way, <lb/>
and with a false key; that is to say, a pretext&#x2014;a <lb/>
pretext invented for the occasion by putting into <lb/>
my mouth words which I did not use, and by <lb/>
wresting sayings of mine from their plain and true <lb/>
meaning. Would he resort to methods like those to <lb/>
get in? No; there are no people of that kind. So <lb/>
then I knew for a certainty that you dictated the <lb/>
<pb n="168"/>
Reply yourself. I knew you did it to save yourself <lb/>
manual labor.</p>
<p>And you had the right, as I have already said; <lb/>
and I am content&#x2014;perfectly content. Yet it would <lb/>
have been little trouble to you, and a great kindness <lb/>
to me, if you had written your Reply all out with <lb/>
your own capable hand.</p>
<p>Because then it would have replied&#x2014;and that is <lb/>
really what a Reply is for. Broadly speaking, its <lb/>
function is to refute&#x2014;as you will easily concede. <lb/>
That leaves something for the other person to take <lb/>
hold of: he has a chance to reply to the Reply, he <lb/>
has a chance to refute the refutation. This would <lb/>
have happened if you had written it out instead of <lb/>
dictating. Dictating is nearly sure to unconcentrate <lb/>
the dictator's mind, when he is out of practice, con- <lb/>
fuse him, and betray him into using one set of <lb/>
literary rules when he ought to use a quite different <lb/>
set. Often it betrays him into employing the <smcap>Rules <lb/>
for Conversation between a Shouter and a <lb/>
Deaf Person</smcap>&#x2014;as in the present case&#x2014;when he <lb/>
ought to employ the <smcap>Rules for Conducting Dis- <lb/>
cussion with a Fault-finder</smcap>. The great founda- <lb/>
tion-rule and basic principle of discussion with a <lb/>
fault-finder is relevancy and concentration upon the <lb/>
subject; whereas the great foundation-rule and basic <lb/>
principle governing conversation between a shouter <lb/>
and a deaf person is irrelevancy and persistent <lb/>
desertion of the topic in hand. If I may be allowed <lb/>
to illustrate by quoting example IV., section 7, <lb/>
<pb n="169"/>
from chapter ix. of "Revised Rules for Conducting <lb/>
Conversation between a Shouter and a Deaf Per- <lb/>
son," it will assist us in getting a clear idea of the <lb/>
difference between the two sets of rules:</p>
<sp><speaker><i>Shouter</i>.</speaker><p>Did you say his name is WETHERBY?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Deaf Person</i>.</speaker><p>Change? Yes, I think it will. <lb/>
Though if it should clear off I&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Shouter</i>.</speaker><p>It's his NAME I want&#x2014;his NAME.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Deaf Person</i>.</speaker><p>Maybe so, maybe so; but it will <lb/>
only be a shower, I think.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Shouter</i>.</speaker><p>No, no, <i>no!</i>&#x2014;you have quite mis- <lb/>
underSTOOD me. If&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Deaf Person</i>.</speaker><p>Ah! GOOD morning; I am sorry <lb/>
you must go. But call again, and let me continue <lb/>
to be of assistance to you in every way I can.</p></sp>
<p>You see it is a perfect kodak of the article you <lb/>
have dictated. It is really curious and interesting <lb/>
when you come to compare it with yours; in detail, <lb/>
with my former article to which it is a Reply in <lb/>
your hand. I talk twelve pages about your Ameri- <lb/>
can instruction projects, and your doubtful scientific <lb/>
system, and your painstaking classification of non- <lb/>
existent things, and your diligence and zeal and <lb/>
sincerity, and your disloyal attitude towards anec- <lb/>
dotes, and your undue reverence for unsafe statistics <lb/>
and for facts that lack a pedigree; and you turn <lb/>
around and come back at me with eight pages of <lb/>
weather.</p>
<p>I do not see how a person can act so. It is good <lb/>
of you to repeat, with change of language, in the <lb/>
<pb n="170"/>
bulk of your rejoinder, so much of my own article, <lb/>
and adopt my sentiments, and make them over, <lb/>
and put new buttons on; and I like the compliment, <lb/>
and am frank to say so; but <i>agreeing</i> with a person <lb/>
cripples controversy and ought not to be allowed. <lb/>
It is weather; and of almost the worst sort. It <lb/>
pleases me greatly to hear you discourse with such <lb/>
approval and expansiveness upon my text:</p>
<p>"A foreigner can photograph the exteriors of a <lb/>
nation, but I think that is as far as he can get. I <lb/>
think that no foreigner can report its interior;"<ref target="n4">*</ref><note id="n4" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>And you say: "A man of average intelligence, who has passed six <lb/>
months among a people, cannot express opinions that are worth jotting <lb/>
down, but he can form impressions that are worth repeating. For my <lb/>
part, I think that foreigners' impressions are more interesting than native <lb/>
opinions. After all, such impressions merely mean 'how the country <lb/>
<i>struck</i> the foreigner.'"</p></note> <lb/>
which is a quite clear way of saying that a foreigner's <lb/>
report is only valuable when it restricts itself to <lb/>
<i>impressions</i>. It pleases me to have you follow my <lb/>
lead in that glowing way, but it leaves me nothing <lb/>
to combat. You should give me something to deny <lb/>
and refute; I would do as much for you.</p>
<p>It pleases me to have you playfully warn the <lb/>
public against taking one of your books seriously.<ref target="n5">&#x2020;</ref><note id="n5" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">&#x2020;</seg><p>When I published <i>Jonathan and his Continent</i>, I wrote in a preface <lb/>
addressed to Jonathan: "If ever you should insist in seeing in this little <lb/>
volume a serious study of your country and of your countrymen, I want <lb/>
you that your world-wide fame for humor will be exploded."</p></note> <lb/>
Because I used to do that cunning thing myself in <lb/>
earlier days. I did it in a prefatory note to a book <lb/>
of mine called <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.</p>

<p>The kernel is the same in both prefaces, you <lb/>
see&#x2014;the public must not take us too seriously. If <lb/>
we remove that kernel we remove the life-principle, <lb/>
and the preface is a corpse. Yes, it pleases me to <lb/>
have you use that idea, for it is a high compliment. <lb/>
But is leaves me nothing to combat; and that is <lb/>
damage to me.</p>
<p>Am I seeming to say that your Reply is not a <lb/>
reply at all, M. Bourget? If so, I must modify <lb/>
that; it is too sweeping. For you have furnished a <lb/>
general answer to my inquiry as to what France&#x2014; <lb/>
through you&#x2014;can teach us.<ref target="n6">*</ref><note id="n6" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>"What could France teach America?" exclaims Mark Twain. <lb/>
France can teach America all the higher pursuits of life, and there is <lb/>
more artistic feeling and refinement in a street of French workingmen <lb/>
than in many avenues inhabited by American millionaires. She can <lb/>
teach her, not perhaps how to work, but how to rest, how to live, how to <lb/>
be happy. She can teach her that the aim of life is not money-making, <lb/>
but that money-making is only a means to obtain an end. She can <lb/>
teach her that wives are not expensive toys, but useful partners, friends, <lb/>
and confidants, who should always keep men under their wholesome in- <lb/>
fluence by their diplomacy, their tact, their common-sense, without <lb/>
bumptiousness. These qualities, added to the highest standard of <lb/>
morality (not angular and morose, but cheerful morality), are conceded <lb/>
to Frenchwomen by whoever knows something of French life outside of <lb/>
the Paris boulevards, and Mark Twain's ill-natured sneer cannot even so <lb/>
much as stain them.</p>
<p>I might tell Mark Twain that in France a man who was seen tipsy in <lb/>
his club would immediately see his name canceled from membership. A <lb/>
man who had settled his fortune on his wife to avoid meeting his cred- <lb/>
itors would be refused admission into any decent society. Many a <lb/>
Frenchman has blown his brains out rather than declare himself a bank- <lb/>
rupt. Now would Mark Twain remark to this: "An American is not <lb/>
such a fool: when a creditor stands in his way he closes his doors, and <lb/>
reopens them the following day. When he has been a bankrupt three <lb/>
times he can retire from business?"</p></note> It is a good answer. <lb/>
<pb n="172"/>
It relates to manners, customs, and morals&#x2014;three <lb/>
things concerning which we can never have ex- <lb/>
haustive and determinate statistics, and so the <lb/>
verdicts delivered upon them must always lack con- <lb/>
clusiveness and be subject to revision; but you have <lb/>
stated the truth, possibly, as nearly as any one <lb/>
could do it, in the circumstances. But why did you <lb/>
choose a detail of my question which could be <lb/>
answered only with vague hearsay evidence, and <lb/>
go right by one which could have been answered <lb/>
with deadly facts?&#x2014;facts in everybody's reach, <lb/>
facts which none can dispute. I asked what France <lb/>
could teach us about government. I laid myself <lb/>
pretty wide open, there; and I thought I was hand- <lb/>
somely generous, too, when I did it. France can <lb/>
teach us how to levy village and city taxes which <lb/>
distribute the burden with a nearer approach to per- <lb/>
fect fairness than is the case in any other land; and <lb/>
she can teach us the wisest and surest system of col- <lb/>
lecting them that exists. She can teach us how to <lb/>
elect a President in a sane way; and also how to do <lb/>
it without throwing the country into earthquakes <lb/>
and convulsions that cripple and embarrass business, <lb/>
stir up party hatred in the hearts of men, and make <lb/>
<pb n="173"/>
peaceful people wish the term extended to thirty <lb/>
years. France can teach us&#x2014;but enough of that <lb/>
part of the question. And what else can France <lb/>
teach us? She can teach us all the fine arts&#x2014;and <lb/>
does. She throws open her hospitable art acade- <lb/>
mies, and says to us, "Come"&#x2014;and we come, <lb/>
troops and troops of our young and gifted; and she <lb/>
sets over us the ablest masters in the world and <lb/>
bearing the greatest names; and she teaches us all <lb/>
that we are capable of learning, and persuades us <lb/>
and encourages us with prizes and honors, much <lb/>
as if we were somehow children of her own; and <lb/>
when this noble education is finished and we are <lb/>
ready to carry it home and spread its gracious <lb/>
ministries abroad over our nation, and we come <lb/>
with homage and gratitude and ask France for the <lb/>
bill&#x2014;<i>there is nothing to pay</i>. And in return for this <lb/>
imperial generosity, what does America do? She <lb/>
charges a duty on French works of art!</p>
<p>I wish I had your end of this dispute; I should <lb/>
have something worth talking about. If you would <lb/>
only furnish me something to argue, something to <lb/>
refute&#x2014;but you persistently won't. You leave <lb/>
good chances unutilized and spend your strength <lb/>
in proving and establishing unimportant things. <lb/>
For instance, you have proven and established these <lb/>
eight facts here following&#x2014;a good score as to <lb/>
number, but not worth while:</p>

<p>A quoted remark of mine "is a gross insult to a nation friendly to <lb/>

<p>"But not even your nasty article on my country, Mark," etc.</p>
<p>"Mark might certainly have derived from it" (M. Bourget's book) <lb/>
"a lesson in politeness and good manners."</p>
<p>A quoted remark of mine is "unworthy of a gentleman."</p></note> These are all true, but really they are not <lb/>
valuable; no one cares much for such finds. In <lb/>
our American magazines we recognize this and sup- <lb/>
press them. We avoid naming them. American <lb/>
writers never allow themselves to name them. It <lb/>
would look as if they were in a temper, and we hold <lb/>
that exhibitions of temper in public are not good <lb/>
form&#x2014;except in the very young and inexperienced. <lb/>
And even if we had the disposition to name them, <lb/>

in order to fill up a gap when we were short of ideas <lb/>
and arguments, our magazines would not allow us to <lb/>
do it, because they think that such words sully their <lb/>
pages. This present magazine is particularly stren- <lb/>
uous about it. Its note to me announcing the <lb/>
forwarding of your proof-sheets to France closed <lb/>
thus&#x2014;for your protection:</item>
</list>
<p>"<i>It is needless to ask you to avoid anything that <lb/>
he might consider as personal</i>."</p>
<p>It was well enough, as a measure of precaution, <lb/>
but really it was not needed. You can trust me im- <lb/>
plicitly, M. Bourget; I shall never call you any <lb/>
names in print which I should be ashamed to call <lb/>
you with your unoffending and dearest ones present.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are reserved, and particular in America <lb/>
to a degree which you would consider exaggerated. <lb/>
For instance, we should not write notes like that one <lb/>
of yours to a lady for a small fault&#x2014;or a large <lb/>
one.<ref target="n8">*</ref><note id="n8" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>When M. Paul Bourget indulges in a little chaffing at the expense <lb/>
of the Americans, "who can always get away with a few years' trying <lb/>
to find out who their grandfathers were," he merely makes an allusion <lb/>
to an American foible; but, forsooth, what a kind man, what a humor- <lb/>
ist Mark Twain is when he retorts by calling France a nation of <lb/>
bastards! How the Americans of culture and refinement will admire <lb/>
him for thus speaking in their name!</p>
<p>Snobbery&#x2026;. I could give Mark Twain an example of the Ameri- <lb/>
can specimen. It is a piquant story. I never published it because I <lb/>
feared my readers might think that I was giving them a typical illustra- <lb/>
tion of American character instead of a rare exception.</p>
<p>I was once booked by my manager to give a <i>causerie</i> in the drawing- <lb/>
room of a New York millionaire. I accepted with reluctance. I do <lb/>
not like private engagements. At five o'clock on the day the <i>causerie</i> <lb/>
was to be given, the lady sent to my manager to say that she would <lb/>
expect me to arrive at nine o'clock and to speak for about an hour. <lb/>
Then she wrote a postscript. Many women are unfortunate there. <lb/>
Their minds are full of after-thoughts, and the most important part of <lb/>
their letters is generally to be found after their signature. This lady's <lb/>
P. S. ran thus: "I suppose he will not expect to be entertained after <lb/>
the lecture."</p>
<p>I fairly shouted, as Mark Twain would say, and then, indulging <lb/>
myself in a bit of snobbishness, I was back at her as quick as a flash&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Dear Madam: As a literary man of some reputation, I have many <lb/>
times had the pleasure of being entertained by the members of the old <lb/>
aristocracy of France. I have also many times had the pleasure of <lb/>
being entertained by the members of the old aristocracy of England. <lb/>
If it may interest you, I can even tell you that I have several times had <lb/>
the honor of being entertained by royalty; but my ambition has never <lb/>
been so wild as to expect that one day I might be entertained by the <lb/>
aristocracy of New York. No, I do not expect to be entertained by <lb/>
you, nor do I want you to expect me to entertain you and your friends <lb/>
to-night, for I decline to keep the engagement."</p>
<p>Now, I could fill a book on America with reminiscences of this sort, <lb/>
adding a few chapters on bosses and boodlers, on New York <i>chronique <lb/>
scandaleuse</i>, on the tenement houses of the large cities, on the gambling- <lb/>
hells of Denver, and the dens of San Francisco, and what not! But <lb/>
not even your nasty article on my country, Mark, will make me do it.</p></note> We should not think it kind. No matter <lb/>
<pb n="176"/>
how much we might have associated with kings and <lb/>
nobilities, we should not think it right to crush her <lb/>
with it and make her ashamed of her lowlier walk in <lb/>
life; for we have a saying, "Who humiliates my <lb/>
mother includes his own."</p>
<p>Do I seriously imagine you to be the author of <lb/>
that strange letter, M. Bourget? Indeed I do not. <lb/>
I believe it to have been surreptitiously inserted by <lb/>
your amanuensis when your back was turned. I <lb/>
think he did it with a good motive, expecting it to <lb/>
<pb n="177"/>
add force and piquancy to your article, but it does <lb/>
not reflect your nature, and I know it will grieve <lb/>
you when you see it. I also think he interlarded <lb/>
many other things which you will disapprove of <lb/>
when you see them. I am certain that all the harsh <lb/>
names discharged at me come from him, not you. <lb/>
No doubt you could have proved me entitled to <lb/>
them with as little trouble as it has cost him to do it, <lb/>
but it would have been your disposition to hunt <lb/>
game of a higher quality.</p>
<p>Why, I even doubt if it is you who furnish me all <lb/>
that excellent information about Balzac and those <lb/>
others.<ref target="n9">*</ref><note id="n9" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>"Now the style of M. Bourget and many other French writers is <lb/>
apparently a closed letter to Mark Twain; but let us leave that alone. <lb/>
Has he read Erckmann-Chatrian, Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Edmond <lb/>
About, Cherbuliez, Renan? Has he read Gustave Droz's <i>Monsieur, <lb/>
Madame, et B&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</i>, and those books which leave for a long time a per- <lb/>
fume about you? Has he read the novels of Alexandre Dumas, Eug&#x00E8;ne <lb/>
Sue, George Sand, and Balzac? Has he read Victor Hugo's <i>Les Mis&#x00E9;- <lb/>
rables</i> and <i>Notre Dame de Paris?</i> Has he read or heard the plays of <lb/>
Sandeau, Augier, Dumas, and Sardou, the works of those Titans of <lb/>
modern literature, whose names will be household words all over the <lb/>
world for hundreds of years to come? He has read <i>La Terre</i>&#x2014;this <lb/>
kind-hearted, refined humorist! When Mark Twain visits a garden <lb/>
does he smell the violets, the roses, the jasmine, or the honeysuckle? <lb/>
No, he goes in the far-away corner where the soil is prepared. Hear <lb/>
what he says: "I wish M. Paul Bourget had read more of our novels <lb/>
before he came. It is the only way to thoroughly understand a people. <lb/>
When I found I was coming to Paris I read <i>La Terre</i>."</p></note> All this in simple justice to you&#x2014;and to <lb/>
me; for, to gravely accept those interlardings as <lb/>
yours would be to wrong your head and heart, and <lb/>
at the same time convict myself of being equipped <lb/>
<pb n="178"/>
with a vacancy where my penetration ought to be <lb/>
lodged.</p>
<p>And now finally I must uncover the secret pain, <lb/>
the wee sore from which the Reply grew&#x2014;<i>the <lb/>
anecdote which closed my recent article</i>&#x2014;and con- <lb/>
sider how it is that this pimple has spread to these <lb/>
cancerous dimensions. If any but you had dictated <lb/>
the Reply, M. Bourget, I would know that that <lb/>
anecdote was twisted around and its intention mag- <lb/>
nified some hundreds of times, in order that it might <lb/>
be used as a pretext to creep in the back way. But <lb/>
I accuse you of nothing&#x2014;nothing but error. When <lb/>
you say that I "retort by calling France a nation of <lb/>
bastards," it is an error. And not a small one, but <lb/>
a large one. I made no such remark, nor anything <lb/>
resembling it. Moreover, the magazine would not <lb/>
have allowed me to use so gross a word as that.</p>
<p>You told an anecdote. A funny one&#x2014;I admit <lb/>
that. It hit a foible of our American aristoc- <lb/>
racy, and it stung me&#x2014;I admit that; it stung me <lb/>
sharply. It was like this: You found some ancient <lb/>
portraits of French kings in the gallery of one of our <lb/>
aristocracy, and you said:</p>
<p>"He has the Grand Monarch, but <i>where is the <lb/>
portrait of his grandfather?</i>" That is, the Ameri- <lb/>
can aristocrat's grandfather.</p>
<p>Now that hits only a few of us, I grant&#x2014;just the <lb/>
upper crust only&#x2014;but it hits exceedingly hard.</p>
<p>I wondered if there was any way of getting back <lb/>
at you. In one of your chapters I found this chance:</p>
<pb n="179"/>
<p>"In our high Parisian existence, for instance, we <lb/>
find applied to arts and luxury, and to debauchery, <lb/>
all the powers and all the weaknesses of the French <lb/>
soul."</p>
<p>You see? Your "higher Parisian" class&#x2014;not <lb/>
everybody, not the nation, but only the <i>top crust</i> of <lb/>
the nation&#x2014;<i>applies to debauchery all the powers of <lb/>
its soul</i>.</p>
<p>I argued to myself that that energy must produce <lb/>
results. So I built an anecdote out of your remark. <lb/>
In it I make Napoleon Bonaparte say to me&#x2014;but <lb/>
see for yourself the anecdote (ingeniously clipped <lb/>
and curtailed) in paragraph eleven of your Reply.<ref target="n10">*</ref><note id="n10" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>So, I repeat, Mark Twain does not like M. Paul Bourget's book. <lb/>
So long as he makes light fun of the great French writer he is at home, <lb/>
he is pleasant, he is the American humorist we know. When he takes <lb/>
his revenge (and where is the reason for taking a revenge?) he is unkind, <lb/>
unfair, bitter, nasty.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>See his answer to a Frenchman who jokingly remarks to him:</p>
<p>"I suppose life can never get entirely dull to an American, because <lb/>
whenever he can't strike up any other way to put in his time, he can <lb/>
always get away with a few years trying to find out who his grandfather <lb/>
was."</p>
<p>Hear the answer:</p>
<p>"I reckon a Frenchman's got <i>his</i> little standby for a dull time, too; <lb/>
because when all other interests fail, he can turn in and see if he can't <lb/>
find out who his father was."</p>
<p>The first remark is a good-humored bit of chaffing on American snob- <lb/>
bery. I may be utterly destitute of humor, but I call the second remark <lb/>
a gratuitous charge of immorality hurled at the French women&#x2014;a <lb/>
remark unworthy of a man who has the ear of the public, unworthy of <lb/>
a gentleman, a gross insult to a nation friendly to America, a nation that <lb/>
helped Mark Twain's ancestors in their struggle for liberty, a nation <lb/>
where to-day it is enough to say that you are American to see every <lb/>
door open wide to you.</p>
<p>If Mark Twain was hard up in search of a French "chestnut," I <lb/>
might have told him the following little anecdote. It is more funny <lb/>
than his, and would have been less insulting: Two little street boys are <lb/>
abusing each other. "Ah, hold your tongue," says one, "you ain't <lb/>
got no father."</p>
<p>"Ain't got no father!" replies the other; "I've got more fathers <lb/>
than you."</p></note></p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>Now, then, your anecdote about the grandfathers <lb/>
hurt me. Why? Because it had a <i>point</i>. It wouldn't <lb/>
have hurt me if it hadn't had point. You wouldn't <lb/>
have wasted space on it if it hadn't had point.</p>
<p>My anecdote has hurt you. Why? Because it had <lb/>
point, I suppose. It wouldn't have hurt you if it <lb/>
hadn't had point. I judged from your remark about <lb/>
the diligence and industry of the high Parisian upper <lb/>
crust that it would have <i>some</i> point, but really I had <lb/>
no idea what a gold-mine I had struck. I never <lb/>
suspected that the point was going to stick into the <lb/>
entire nation; but of course you know your nation <lb/>
better than I do, and if you think it punctures them <lb/>
all, I have to yield to your judgment. But you are <lb/>
to blame, your own self. Your remark misled me. <lb/>
I supposed the industry was confined to that little <lb/>
unnumerous upper layer.</p>
<p>Well, now that the unfortunate thing has been <lb/>
done, let us do what we can to undo it. There <lb/>
must be a way, M. Bourget, and I am willing to do <lb/>
anything that will help; for I am as sorry as you <lb/>
can be yourself.</p>
<p>I will tell you what I think will be the very thing. <lb/>
<pb n="181"/>
We will <i>swap anecdotes</i>. I will take your anecdote <lb/>
and you take mine. I will say to the dukes and <lb/>
counts and princes of the ancient nobility of France: <lb/>
"Ha, ha! You must have a pretty hard time trying <lb/>
to find out who your grandfathers were?"</p>
<p>They will merely smile indifferently and not feel <lb/>
hurt, because they can trace their lineage back <lb/>
through centuries.</p>
<p>And you will hurl mine at every individual in the <lb/>
American nation, saying:</p>
<p>"And <i>you</i> must have a pretty hard time trying to <lb/>
find out who your <i>fathers</i> were." They will merely <lb/>
smile indifferently, and not feel hurt, because they <lb/>
haven't any difficulty in finding their fathers.</p>
<p>Do you get the idea? The whole harm in the <lb/>
anecdotes is in the <i>point</i>, you see; and when we <lb/>
swap them around that way, they <i>haven't</i> any.</p>
<p>That settles it perfectly and beautifully, and I am <lb/>
glad I thought of it. I am very glad indeed, M. <lb/>
Bourget; for it was just that little wee thing that <lb/>
caused the whole difficulty and made you dictate the <lb/>
Reply, and your amanuensis call me all those hard <lb/>
names which the magazines dislike so. And I did it <lb/>
all in fun, too, trying to cap your funny anecdote <lb/>
with another one&#x2014;on the give-and-take principle, <lb/>
you know&#x2014;which is American. <i>I</i> didn't know <lb/>
that with the French it was all give and no take, and <lb/>
you didn't tell me. But now that I have made <lb/>
everything comfortable again, and fixed both anec- <lb/>
dotes so they can never have any point any more, I <lb/>
know you will forgive me.</p>

<head><b>THE INVALID'S STORY</b></head>
<p><smcap>I seem</smcap> sixty and married, but these effects are due <lb/>
to my condition and sufferings, for I am a <lb/>
bachelor, and only forty-one. It will be hard for <lb/>
you to believe that I, who am now but a shadow, <lb/>
was a hale, hearty man two short years ago,&#x2014; <lb/>
a man of iron, a very athlete!&#x2014;yet such is the <lb/>
simple truth. But stranger still than this fact <lb/>
is the way in which I lost my health. I lost it <lb/>
through helping to take care of a box of guns <lb/>
on a two-hundred-mile railway journey one winter's <lb/>
night. It is the actual truth, and I will tell you <lb/>
about it.</p>
<p>I belong in Cleveland, Ohio. One winter's night, <lb/>
two years ago, I reached home just after dark, in a <lb/>
driving snow-storm, and the first thing I heard when I <lb/>
entered the house was that my dearest boyhood friend <lb/>
and schoolmate, John B. Hackett, had died the day <lb/>
before, and that his last utterance had been a desire <lb/>
that I would take his remains home to his poor old <lb/>
father and mother in Wisconsin. I was greatly <lb/>
shocked and grieved, but there was no time to waste <lb/>
in emotions; I must start at once. I took the <lb/>
<pb n="183"/>
card, marked "Deacon Levi Hackett, Bethlehem, <lb/>
Wisconsin," and hurried off through the whistling <lb/>
storm to the railway station. Arrived there I <lb/>
found the long white-pine box which had been <lb/>
described to me; I fastened the card to it with <lb/>
some tacks, saw it put safely aboard the express <lb/>
car, and then ran into the eating-room to provide <lb/>
myself with a sandwich and some cigars. When I <lb/>
returned, presently, there was my coffin-box <i>back <lb/>
again</i>, apparently, and a young fellow examining <lb/>
around it, with a card in his hands, and some tacks <lb/>
and a hammer! I was astonished and puzzled. He <lb/>
began to nail on his card, and I rushed out to the <lb/>
express car, in a good deal of a state of mind, to ask <lb/>
for an explanation. But no&#x2014;there was my box, <lb/>
all right, in the express car; it hadn't been disturbed. <lb/>
[The fact is that without my suspecting it a pro- <lb/>
digious mistake had been made. I was carrying off <lb/>
a box of <i>guns</i> which that young fellow had come to <lb/>
the station to ship to a rifle company in Peoria, <lb/>
Illinois, and <i>he</i> had got my corpse!] Just then the <lb/>
conductor sung out "All aboard," and I jumped <lb/>
into the express car and got a comfortable seat on <lb/>
a bale of buckets. The expressman was there, hard <lb/>
at work,&#x2014;a plain man of fifty, with a simple, honest, <lb/>
good-natured face, and a breezy, practical heartiness <lb/>
in his general style. As the train moved off a stranger <lb/>
skipped into the car and set a package of peculiarly <lb/>
mature and capable Limburger cheese on one end of <lb/>
my coffin-box&#x2014;I mean my box of guns. That is <lb/>
<pb n="184"/>
to say, I know <i>now</i> that it was Limburger cheese, <lb/>
but at that time I never had heard of the article in <lb/>
my life, and of course was wholly ignorant of its <lb/>
character. Well, we sped through the wild night, <lb/>
the bitter storm raged on, a cheerless misery stole <lb/>
over me, my heart went down, down, down! The <lb/>
old expressman made a brisk remark or two about <lb/>
the tempest and the arctic weather, slammed his <lb/>
sliding doors to, and bolted them, closed his window <lb/>
down tight, and then went bustling around, here and <lb/>
there and yonder, setting things to rights, and all the <lb/>
time contentedly humming "Sweet By and By," in <lb/>
a low tone, and flatting a good deal. Presently I <lb/>
began to detect a most evil and searching odor steal- <lb/>
ing about on the frozen air. This depressed my <lb/>
spirits still more, because of course I attributed it to <lb/>
my poor departed friend. There was something in- <lb/>
finitely saddening about his calling himself to my re- <lb/>
membrance in this dumb pathetic way, so it was <lb/>
hard to keep the tears back. Moreover, it distressed <lb/>
me on account of the old expressman, who, I was <lb/>
afraid, might notice it. However, he went humming <lb/>
tranquilly on, and gave no sign; and for this I was <lb/>
grateful. Grateful, yes, but still uneasy; and soon <lb/>
I began to feel more and more uneasy every minute, <lb/>
for every minute that went by that odor thickened <lb/>
up the more, and got to be more and more gamey <lb/>
and hard to stand. Presently, having got things <lb/>
arranged to his satisfaction, the expressman got some <lb/>
wood and made up a tremendous fire in his stove. <lb/>
<pb n="185"/>
This distressed me more than I can tell, for I could <lb/>
not but feel that it was a mistake. I was sure that <lb/>
the effect would be deleterious upon my poor de- <lb/>
parted friend. Thompson&#x2014;the expressman's name <lb/>
was Thompson, as I found out in the course of the <lb/>
night&#x2014;now went poking around his car, stopping <lb/>
up whatever stray cracks he could find, remarking <lb/>
that it didn't make any difference what kind of a <lb/>
night it was outside, he calculated to make <i>us</i> com- <lb/>
fortable, anyway. I said nothing, but I believed he <lb/>
was not choosing the right way. Meantime he was <lb/>
humming to himself just as before; and meantime, <lb/>
too, the stove was getting hotter and hotter, and the <lb/>
place closer and closer. I felt myself growing pale <lb/>
and qualmish, but grieved in silence and said nothing. <lb/>
Soon I noticed that the "Sweet By and By" was <lb/>
gradually fading out; next it ceased altogether, and <lb/>
there was an ominous stillness. After a few moments <lb/>
Thompson said,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Pfew! I reckon it ain't no cinnamon 't I've <lb/>
loaded up thish-yer stove with!"</p>
<p>He gasped once or twice, then moved toward the <lb/>
cof&#x2014;gun-box, stood over that Limburger cheese <lb/>
part of a moment, then came back and sat down <lb/>
near me, looking a good deal impressed. After a <lb/>
contemplative pause, he said, indicating the box with <lb/>
a gesture,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Friend of yourn?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"He's pretty ripe, <i>ain't</i> he!"</p>
<pb n="186"/>
<p>Nothing further was said for perhaps a couple of <lb/>
minutes, each being busy with his own thoughts; <lb/>
then Thompson said, in a low, awed voice,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's uncertain whether they're really <lb/>
gone or not,&#x2014;<i>seem</i> gone, you know&#x2014;body warm, <lb/>
joints limber&#x2014;and so, although you <i>think</i> they're <lb/>
gone, you don't really know. I've had cases in my <lb/>
car. It's perfectly awful, becuz <i>you</i> don't know <lb/>
what minute they'll rise up and look at you!" <lb/>
Then, after a pause, and slightly lifting his elbow <lb/>
toward the box,&#x2014;"But <i>he</i> ain't in no trance! <lb/>
No, sir, I go bail for <i>him!</i>"</p>
<p>We sat some time, in meditative silence, listen- <lb/>
ing to the wind and the roar of the train; then <lb/>
Thompson said, with a good deal of feeling,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Well-a-well, we've all got to go, they ain't no <lb/>
getting around it. Man that is born of woman is of <lb/>
few days and far between, as Scriptur' says. Yes, <lb/>
you look at it any way you want to, it's awful solemn <lb/>
and cur'us: they ain't <i>nobody</i> can get around it; <lb/>
<i>all's</i> got to go&#x2014;just <i>everybody</i>, as you may say. <lb/>
One day you're hearty and strong"&#x2014;here he <lb/>
scrambled to his feet and broke a pane and stretched <lb/>
his nose out at it a moment or two, then sat down <lb/>
again while I struggled up and thrust my nose out at <lb/>
the same place, and this we kept on doing every now <lb/>
and then&#x2014;"and next day he's cut down like the <lb/>
grass, and the places which knowed him then knows <lb/>
him no more forever, as Scriptur' says. Yes'ndeedy, <lb/>
it's awful solemn and cur'us; but we've all got to <lb/>
<pb n="187"/>
go, one time or another; they ain't no getting <lb/>
around it."</p>
<p>There was another long pause; then,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"What did he die of?"</p>
<p>I said I didn't know.</p>
<p>"How long has he ben dead?"</p>
<p>It seemed judicious to enlarge the facts to fit the <lb/>
probabilities; so I said,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Two or three days."</p>
<p>But it did no good; for Thompson received it <lb/>
with an injured look which plainly said, "Two or <lb/>
three <i>years</i>, you mean." Then he went right along, <lb/>
placidly ignoring my statement, and gave his views <lb/>
at considerable length upon the unwisdom of putting <lb/>
off burials too long. Then he lounged off toward <lb/>
the box, stood a moment, then came back on a sharp <lb/>
trot and visited the broken pane, observing,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"'Twould 'a' ben a dum sight better, all around, <lb/>
if they'd started him along last summer."</p>
<p>Thompson sat down and buried his face in his red <lb/>
silk handkerchief, and began to slowly sway and <lb/>
rock his body like one who is doing his best to <lb/>
endure the almost unendurable. By this time the <lb/>
fragrance&#x2014;if you may call it fragrance&#x2014;was just <lb/>
about suffocating, as near as you can come at it. <lb/>
Thompson's face was turning gray; I knew mine <lb/>
hadn't any color left in it. By and by Thompson <lb/>
rested his forehead in his left hand, with his elbow <lb/>
on his knee, and sort of waved his red handkerchief <lb/>
towards the box with his other hand, and said,&#x2014;</p>
<pb n="188"/>
<p>"I've carried a many a one of 'em,&#x2014;some of <lb/>
'em considerable overdue, too,&#x2014;but, lordy, he just <lb/>
lays over 'em all!&#x2014;and does it <i>easy</i>. Cap., they <lb/>
was heliotrope to <i>him!</i>"</p>
<p>This recognition of my poor friend gratified me, <lb/>
in spite of the sad circumstances, because it had so <lb/>
much the sound of a compliment.</p>
<p>Pretty soon it was plain that something had got <lb/>
to be done. I suggested cigars. Thompson thought <lb/>
it was a good idea. He said,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Likely it'll modify him some."</p>
<p>We puffed gingerly along for a while, and tried <lb/>
hard to imagine that things were improved. But <lb/>
it wasn't any use. Before very long, and without <lb/>
any consultation, both cigars were quietly dropped <lb/>
from our nerveless fingers at the same moment. <lb/>
Thompson said, with a sigh,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"No, Cap., it don't modify him worth a cent. <lb/>
Fact is, it makes him worse, becuz it appears to <lb/>
stir up his ambition. What do you reckon we better <lb/>
do, now?"</p>
<p>I was not able to suggest anything; indeed, I had <lb/>
to be swallowing and swallowing, all the time, and <lb/>
did not like to trust myself to speak. Thompson <lb/>
fell to maundering, in a desultory and low-spirited <lb/>
way, about the miserable experiences of this night; <lb/>
and he got to referring to my poor friend by various <lb/>
titles,&#x2014;sometimes military ones, sometimes civil <lb/>
ones; and I noticed that as fast as my poor friend's <lb/>
effectiveness grew, Thompson promoted him ac- <lb/>
<pb n="189"/>
cordingly,&#x2014;gave him a bigger title. Finally he <lb/>
said,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"I've got an idea. Suppos'n we buckle down to <lb/>
it and give the Colonel a bit of a shove towards <lb/>
t'other end of the car?&#x2014;about ten foot, say. He <lb/>
wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you <lb/>
reckon?"</p>
<p>I said it was a good scheme. So we took in <lb/>
a good fresh breath at the broken pane, calculat- <lb/>
ing to hold it till we got through; then we went <lb/>
there and bent over that deadly cheese and took a <lb/>
grip on the box. Thompson nodded "All ready," <lb/>
and then we threw ourselves forward with all our <lb/>
might; but Thompson slipped, and slumped down <lb/>
with his nose on the cheese, and his breath got <lb/>
loose. He gagged and gasped, and floundered up <lb/>
and made a break for the door, pawing the air <lb/>
and saying hoarsely, "Don't hender me!&#x2014;gimme <lb/>
the road! I'm a-dying; gimme the road!" Out <lb/>
on the cold platform I sat down and held his head <lb/>
a while, and he revived. Presently he said,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Do you reckon we started the Gen'rul any?"</p>
<p>I said no; we hadn't budged him.</p>
<p>"Well, then, <i>that</i> idea's up the flume. We got <lb/>
to think up something else. He's suited wher' he <lb/>
is, I reckon; and if that's the way he feels about it, <lb/>
and has made up his mind that he don't wish to be <lb/>
disturbed, you bet he's a-going to have his own way <lb/>
in the business. Yes, better leave him right wher' <lb/>
he is, long as he wants it so; becuz he holds all the <lb/>
<pb n="190"/>
trumps, don't you know, and so it stands to reason <lb/>
that the man that lays out to alter his plans for him <lb/>
is going to get left."</p>
<p>But we couldn't stay out there in that mad storm; <lb/>
we should have frozen to death. So we went in <lb/>
again and shut the door, and began to suffer once <lb/>
more and take turns at the break in the window. By <lb/>
and by, as we were starting away from a station where <lb/>
we had stopped a moment Thompson pranced in <lb/>
cheerily, and exclaimed,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"We're all right, now! I reckon we've got the <lb/>
Commodore this time. I judge I've got the stuff <lb/>
here that'll take the tuck out of him."</p>
<p>It was carbolic acid. He had a carboy of it. He <lb/>
sprinkled it all around everywhere; in fact he <lb/>
drenched everything with it, rifle-box, cheese and all. <lb/>
Then we sat down, feeling pretty hopeful. But it <lb/>
wasn't for long. You see the two perfumes began <lb/>
to mix, and then&#x2014;well, pretty soon we made a <lb/>
break for the door; and out there Thompson swabbed <lb/>
his face with his bandanna and said in a kind of dis- <lb/>
heartened way,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"It ain't no use. We can't buck agin <i>him</i>. He <lb/>
just utilizes everything we put up to modify him with, <lb/>
and gives it his own flavor and plays it back on us. <lb/>
Why, Cap., don't you know, it's as much as a <lb/>
hundred times worse in there now than it was when <lb/>
he first got a-going. I never <i>did</i> see one of 'em <lb/>
warm up to his work so, and take such a dumnation <lb/>
interest in it. No, sir, I never did, as long as I've <lb/>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>THESE GAVE IT A BETTER HOLD</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="191"/>
ben on the road; and I've carried a many a one of <lb/>
'em, as I was telling you."</p>
<p>We went in again after we were frozen pretty <lb/>
stiff; but my, we couldn't <i>stay</i> in, now. So <lb/>
we just waltzed back and forth, freezing, and <lb/>
thawing, and stifling, by turns. In about an hour <lb/>
we stopped at another station; and as we left it <lb/>
Thompson came in with a bag, and said,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Cap., I'm a-going to chance him once more,&#x2014; <lb/>
just this once; and if we don't fetch him this time, <lb/>
the thing for us to do, is to just throw up the sponge <lb/>
and withdraw from the canvass. That's the way <i>I</i> <lb/>
put it up."</p>
<p>He had brought a lot of chicken feathers, and <lb/>
dried apples, and leaf tobacco, and rags, and old <lb/>
shoes, and sulphur, and asaf&#x0153;tida, and one thing or <lb/>
another; and he piled them on a breadth of sheet <lb/>
iron in the middle of the floor, and set fire to them.</p>
<p>When they got well started, I couldn't see, myself, <lb/>
how even the corpse could stand it. All that went <lb/>
before was just simply poetry to that smell,&#x2014;but <lb/>
mind you, the original smell stood up out of it just <lb/>
as sublime as ever,&#x2014;fact is, these other smells just <lb/>
seemed to give it a better hold; and my, how rich it <lb/>
was! I didn't make these reflections there&#x2014;there <lb/>
wasn't time&#x2014;made them on the platform. And <lb/>
breaking for the platform, Thompson got suffocated <lb/>
and fell; and before I got him dragged out, which I <lb/>
did by the collar, I was mighty near gone myself. <lb/>
When we revived, Thompson said dejectedly,&#x2014;</p>
<pb n="192"/>
<p>"We got to stay out here, Cap. We got to do it. <lb/>
They ain't no other way. The Governor wants to <lb/>
travel alone, and he's fixed so he can outvote us."</p>
<p>And presently he added,&#x2014;</p>
<p>"And don't you know, we're <i>pisoned</i>. It's <i>our</i> <lb/>
last trip, you can make up your mind to it. Typhoid <lb/>
fever is what's going to come of this. I feel it a- <lb/>
coming right now. Yes, sir, we're elected, just as <lb/>
sure as you're born."</p>
<p>We were taken from the platform an hour later, <lb/>
frozen and insensible, at the next station, and I went <lb/>
straight off into a virulent fever, and never knew any- <lb/>
thing again for three weeks. I found out, then, that <lb/>
I had spent that awful night with a harmless box of <lb/>
rifles and a lot of innocent cheese; but the news was <lb/>
too late to save <i>me;</i> imagination had done its work, <lb/>
and my health was permanently shattered; neither <lb/>
Bermuda nor any other land can ever bring it back <lb/>
to me. This is my last trip; I am on my way home <lb/>
to die.</p>

<head><b>THE CAPTAIN'S STORY</b></head>
<p><smcap>There</smcap> was a good deal of pleasant gossip about <lb/>
old Captain "Hurricane" Jones, of the Pacific <lb/>
Ocean,&#x2014;peace to his ashes! Two or three of us <lb/>
present had known him; I, particularly well, for I <lb/>
had made four sea-voyages with him. He was a <lb/>
very remarkable man. He was born on a ship; <lb/>
he picked up what little education he had among <lb/>
his shipmates; he began life in the forecastle, and <lb/>
climbed grade by grade to the captaincy. More <lb/>
than fifty years of his sixty-five were spent at sea. <lb/>
He had sailed all oceans, seen all lands, and bor- <lb/>
rowed a tint from all climates. When a man has <lb/>
been fifty years at sea, he necessarily knows noth- <lb/>
ing of men, nothing of the world but its surface, <lb/>
nothing of the world's thought, nothing of the <lb/>
world's learning but its A B C, and that blurred <lb/>
and distorted by the unfocused lenses of an un- <lb/>
trained mind. Such a man is only a gray and <lb/>
bearded child. That is what old Hurricane Jones <lb/>
was,&#x2014;simply an innocent, lovable old infant. When <lb/>
his spirit was in repose he was as sweet and gentle <lb/>
as a girl; when his wrath was up he was a hurricane <lb/>
<pb n="194"/>
that made his nickname seem tamely descriptive. <lb/>
He was formidable in a fight, for he was of powerful <lb/>
build and dauntless courage. He was frescoed from <lb/>
head to heel with pictures and mottoes tattooed in <lb/>
red and blue India ink. I was with him one voyage <lb/>
when he got his last vacant space tattooed; this <lb/>
vacant space was around his left ankle. During <lb/>
three days he stumped about the ship with his ankle <lb/>
bare and swollen, and this legend gleaming red and <lb/>
angry out from a clouding of India ink: "Virtue is <lb/>
its own R'd." (There was a lack of room.) He <lb/>
was deeply and sincerely pious, and swore like a <lb/>
fish-woman. He considered swearing blameless, <lb/>
because sailors would not understand an order un- <lb/>
illumined by it. He was a profound Biblical scholar, <lb/>
&#x2014;that is, he thought he was. He believed every- <lb/>
thing in the Bible, but he had his own methods of <lb/>
arriving at his beliefs. He was of the "advanced" <lb/>
school of thinkers, and applied natural laws to the <lb/>
interpretation of all miracles, somewhat on the plan <lb/>
of the people who make the six days of creation six <lb/>
geological epochs, and so forth. Without being <lb/>
aware of it, he was a rather severe satire on modern <lb/>
scientific religionists. Such a man as I have been <lb/>
describing is rabidly fond of disquisition and argu- <lb/>
ment; one knows that without being told it.</p>
<p>One trip the captain had a clergyman on board, <lb/>
but did not know he was a clergyman, since the <lb/>
passenger list did not betray the fact. He took <lb/>
a great liking to this Rev. Mr. Peters, and talked <lb/>
<pb n="195"/>
with him a great deal: told him yarns, gave him <lb/>
toothsome scraps of personal history, and wove a <lb/>
glittering streak of profanity through his garru- <lb/>
lous fabric that was refreshing to a spirit weary <lb/>
of the dull neutralities of undecorated speech. One <lb/>
day the captain said, "Peters, do you ever read <lb/>
the Bible?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;yes."</p>
<p>"I judge it ain't often, by the way you say it. <lb/>
Now, you tackle it in dead earnest once, and you'll <lb/>
find it'll pay. Don't you get discouraged, but hang <lb/>
right on. First, you won't understand it; but by <lb/>
and by things will begin to clear up, and then you <lb/>
wouldn't lay it down to eat."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have heard that said."</p>
<p>"And it's so, too. There ain't a book that begins <lb/>
with it. It lays over 'em all, Peters. There's some <lb/>
pretty tough things in it,&#x2014;there ain't any getting <lb/>
around that,&#x2014;but you stick to them and think them <lb/>
out, and when once you get on the inside every- <lb/>
thing's plain as day."</p>
<p>"The miracles, too, captain?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir! the miracles, too. Every one of them. <lb/>
Now, there's that business with the prophets of <lb/>
Baal; like enough that stumped you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Own up, now; it stumped you. Well, I don't <lb/>
wonder. You hadn't had any experience in raveling <lb/>
such things out, and naturally it was too many for <lb/>
you. Would you like to have me explain that thing <lb/>
<pb n="196"/>
to you, and show you how to get at the meat of <lb/>
these matters?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I would, captain, if you don't mind."</p>
<p>Then the captain proceeded as follows: "I'll do <lb/>
it with pleasure. First, you see, I read and read, <lb/>
and thought and thought, till I got to understand <lb/>
what sort of people they were in the old Bible times, <lb/>
and then after that it was clear and easy. Now, this <lb/>
was the way I put it up, concerning Isaac<ref target="n11">*</ref><note id="n11" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>This is the captain's own mistake.</p></note> and the <lb/>
prophets of Baal. There was some mighty sharp <lb/>
men amongst the public characters of that old <lb/>
ancient day, and Isaac was one of them. Isaac had <lb/>
his failings,&#x2014;plenty of them, too; it ain't for me to <lb/>
apologize for Isaac; he played on the prophets of <lb/>
Baal, and like enough he was justifiable, considering <lb/>
the odds that was against him. No, all I say is, <lb/>
't wa'n't any miracle, and that I'll show you so's't <lb/>
you can see it yourself.</p>
<p>"Well, times had been getting rougher and <lb/>
rougher for prophets,&#x2014;that is, prophets of Isaac's <lb/>
denomination. There were four hundred and fifty <lb/>
prophets of Baal in the community, and only one <lb/>
Presbyterian; that is, if Isaac <i>was</i> a Presbyterian, <lb/>
which I reckon he was, but it don't say. Naturally, <lb/>
the prophets of Baal took all the trade. Isaac was <lb/>
pretty low-spirited, I reckon, but he was a good deal <lb/>
of a man, and no doubt he went a-prophesying <lb/>
around, letting on to be doing a land-office busi- <lb/>
<pb n="197"/>
ness, but 't wa'n't any use; he couldn't run any <lb/>
opposition to amount to anything. By and by <lb/>
things got desperate with him; he sets his head <lb/>
to work and thinks it all out, and then what does <lb/>
he do? Why, he begins to throw out hints that <lb/>
the other parties are this and that and t'other,&#x2014; <lb/>
nothing very definite, may be, but just kind of <lb/>
undermining their reputation in a quiet way. This <lb/>
made talk, of course, and finally got to the king. <lb/>
The king asked Isaac what he meant by his talk. <lb/>
Says Isaac, 'Oh, nothing particular; only, can <lb/>
they pray down fire from heaven on an altar? It <lb/>
ain't much, maybe, your majesty, only can they <lb/>
<i>do</i> it? That's the idea.' So the king was a good <lb/>
deal disturbed, and he went to the prophets of <lb/>
Baal, and they said, pretty airy, that if he had <lb/>
an altar ready, <i>they</i> were ready; and they inti- <lb/>
mated he better get it insured, too.</p>
<p>"So next morning all the children of Israel and <lb/>
their parents and the other people gathered them- <lb/>
selves together. Well, here was that great crowd of <lb/>
prophets of Baal packed together on one side, and <lb/>
Isaac walking up and down all alone on the other, <lb/>
putting up his job. When time was called, Isaac let <lb/>
on to be comfortable and indifferent; told the other <lb/>
team to take the first innings. So they went at it, <lb/>
the whole four hundred and fifty, praying around the <lb/>
altar, very hopeful, and doing their level best. They <lb/>
prayed an hour,&#x2014;two hours,&#x2014;three hours,&#x2014;and <lb/>
so on, plumb till noon. It wa'n't any use; they <lb/>
<pb n="198"/>
hadn't took a trick. Of course they felt kind <lb/>
of ashamed before all those people, and well they <lb/>
might. Now, what would a magnanimous man <lb/>
do? Keep still, wouldn't he? Of course. What <lb/>
did Isaac do? He graveled the prophets of Baal <lb/>
every way he could think of. Says he, 'You <lb/>
don't speak up loud enough; your god's asleep, <lb/>
like enough, or maybe he's taking a walk; you <lb/>
want to holler, you know,'&#x2014;or words to that ef- <lb/>
fect; I don't recollect the exact language. Mind, <lb/>
I don't apologize for Isaac; he had his faults.</p>
<p>"Well, the prophets of Baal prayed along the best <lb/>
they knew how all the afternoon, and never raised a <lb/>
spark. At last, about sundown, they were all <lb/>
tuckered out, and they owned up and quit.</p>
<p>"What does Isaac do, now? He steps up and <lb/>
says to some friends of his, there, 'Pour four barrels <lb/>
of water on the altar!' Everybody was astonished; <lb/>
for the other side had prayed at it dry, you know, <lb/>
and got whitewashed. They poured it on. Says he, <lb/>
'Heave on four more barrels.' Then he says, <lb/>
'Heave on four more.' Twelve barrels, you see, <lb/>
altogether. The water ran all over the altar, and all <lb/>
down the sides, and filled up a trench around it that <lb/>
would hold a couple of hogsheads,&#x2014;'measures,' it <lb/>
says; I reckon it means about a hogshead. Some <lb/>
of the people were going to put on their things and <lb/>
go, for they allowed he was crazy. They didn't <lb/>
know Isaac. Isaac knelt down and began to pray: <lb/>
he strung along, and strung along, about the heathen <lb/>
<pb n="199"/>
in distant lands, and about the sister churches, and <lb/>
about the state and the country at large, and about <lb/>
those that's in authority in the government, and all <lb/>
the usual programme, you know, till everybody had <lb/>
got tired and gone to thinking about something <lb/>
else, and then, all of a sudden, when nobody was <lb/>
noticing, he outs with a match and rakes it on <lb/>
the under side of his leg, and pff! up the whole <lb/>
thing blazes like a house afire! Twelve barrels of <lb/>
<i>water? Petroleum</i>, sir, <smcap>petroleum</smcap>! that's what <lb/>
it was!"</p>
<p>"Petroleum, captain?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; the country was full of it. Isaac <lb/>
knew all about that. You read the Bible. Don't <lb/>
you worry about the tough places. They ain't tough <lb/>
when you come to think them out and throw light <lb/>
on them. There ain't a thing in the Bible but what <lb/>
is true; all you want is to go prayerfully to work and <lb/>
cipher out how 't was done."</p>

<head><b>STIRRING TIMES IN AUSTRIA</b></head>
<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head><smcap>i. the government in the frying-pan</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Here</smcap> in Vienna in these closing days of 1897 <lb/>
one's blood gets no chance to stagnate. The <lb/>
atmosphere is brimful of political electricity. All <lb/>
conversation is political; every man is a battery, <lb/>
with brushes overworn, and gives out blue sparks <lb/>
when you set him going on the common topic. <lb/>
Everybody has an opinion, and lets you have it <lb/>
frank and hot, and out of this multitude of coun- <lb/>
sel you get merely confusion and despair. For <lb/>
no one really understands this political situation, <lb/>
or can tell you what is going to be the outcome <lb/>
of it.</p>
<p>Things have happened here recently which <lb/>
would set any country but Austria on fire from <lb/>
end to end, and upset the government to a <lb/>
certainty; but no one feels confident that such <lb/>
results will follow here. Here, apparently, one <lb/>
must wait and see what will happen, then <lb/>
he will know, and not before; guessing is <lb/>
idle; guessing cannot help the matter. This is <lb/>
<pb n="201"/>
what the wise tell you; they all say it; they say it <lb/>
every day, and it is the sole detail upon which they <lb/>
all agree.</p>
<p>There is some approach to agreement upon an- <lb/>
other point: that there will be no revolution. Men <lb/>
say: "Look at our history&#x2014;revolutions have not <lb/>
been in our line; and look at our political map <lb/>
&#x2014;its construction is unfavorable to an organized <lb/>
uprising, and without unity what could a revolt <lb/>
accomplish? It is <i>dis</i>union which has held our <lb/>
empire together for centuries, and what it has <lb/>
done in the past it may continue to do now and <lb/>
in the future."</p>
<p>The most intelligible sketch I have encountered <lb/>
of this unintelligible arrangement of things was con- <lb/>
tributed to the <i>Travelers Record</i> by Mr. Forrest <lb/>
Morgan, of Hartford, three years ago. He says: <lb/>
<q>The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy is the patchwork quilt, the Mid- <lb/>
way Plaisance, the national chain-gang of Europe; a state that is not a <lb/>
nation but a collection of nations, some with national memories and <lb/>
aspirations and others without, some occupying distinct provinces almost <lb/>
purely their own, and others mixed with alien races, but each with a <lb/>
different language, and each mostly holding the others foreigners as <lb/>
much as if the link of a common government did not exist. Only one of <lb/>
its races even now comprises so much as <i>one-fourth</i> of the whole, and <lb/>
not another so much as <i>one-sixth;</i> and each has remained for ages as <lb/>
unchanged in isolation, however mingled together in locality, as glob- <lb/>
ules of oil in water. There is nothing else in the modern world that is <lb/>
nearly like it, though there have been plenty in past ages; it seems un- <lb/>
real and impossible even though we know it is true; it violates all our <lb/>
feeling as to what a country should be in order to have a right to exist; <lb/>
and it seems as though it was too ramshackle to go on holding together <lb/>
any length of time. Yet it has survived, much in its present shape, two <lb/>
<pb n="202"/>
centuries of storms that have swept perfectly unified countries from <lb/>
existence and others that have brought it to the verge of ruin, has sur- <lb/>
vived formidable European coalitions to dismember it, and has steadily <lb/>
gained force after each; forever changing in its exact make-up, losing <lb/>
in the West but gaining in the East, the changes leave the structure as firm <lb/>
as ever, like the dropping off and adding on of logs in a raft, its mechan- <lb/>
ical union of pieces showing all the vitality of genuine national life.</q></p>
<p>That seems to confirm and justify the prevalent <lb/>
Austrian faith that in this confusion of unrelated and <lb/>
irreconcilable elements, this condition of incurable <lb/>
disunion, there is strength&#x2014;for the government. <lb/>
Nearly every day some one explains to me that a <lb/>
revolution would not succeed here. "It couldn't, <lb/>
you know. Broadly speaking, all the nations in the <lb/>
empire hate the government&#x2014;but they all hate each <lb/>
other, too, and with devoted and enthusiastic bitter- <lb/>
ness; no two of them can combine; the nation that <lb/>
rises must rise alone; then the others would joyfully <lb/>
join the government against her, and she would have <lb/>
just a fly's chance against a combination of spiders. <lb/>
This government is entirely independent. It can go <lb/>
its own road, and do as it pleases; it has nothing to <lb/>
fear. In countries like England and America, where <lb/>
there is one tongue and the public interests are <lb/>
common, the government must take account of public <lb/>
opinion; but in Austria-Hungary there are nineteen <lb/>
public opinions&#x2014;one for each state. No&#x2014;two or <lb/>
three for each state, since there are two or three <lb/>
nationalities in each. A government cannot satisfy <lb/>
all these public opinions; it can only go through the <lb/>
motions of trying. This government does that. It <lb/>
<pb n="203"/>
goes through the motions, and they do not succeed; <lb/>
but that does not worry the government much."</p>
<p>The next man will give you some further informa- <lb/>
tion. "The government has a policy&#x2014;a wise one <lb/>
&#x2014;and sticks steadily to it. This policy is&#x2014;<i>tran- <lb/>
quillity:</i> keep this hive of excitable nations as quiet <lb/>
as possible; encourage them to amuse themselves <lb/>
with things less inflammatory than politics. To this <lb/>
end it furnishes them an abundance of Catholic priests <lb/>
to teach them to be docile and obedient, and to be <lb/>
diligent in acquiring ignorance about things here <lb/>
below, and knowledge about the kingdom of heaven, <lb/>
to whose historic delights they are going to add the <lb/>
charm of their society by-and-by; and further&#x2014;to <lb/>
this same end&#x2014;it cools off the newspapers every <lb/>
morning at five o'clock, whenever warm events are <lb/>
happening." There is a censor of the press, and <lb/>
apparently he is always on duty and hard at work. <lb/>
A copy of each morning paper is brought to him at <lb/>
five o'clock. His official wagons wait at the doors <lb/>
of the newspaper offices and scud to him with the <lb/>
first copies that come from the press. His company <lb/>
of assistants read every line in these papers, and mark <lb/>
everything which seems to have a dangerous look; <lb/>
then he passes final judgment upon these markings. <lb/>
Two things conspire to give to the results a capricious <lb/>
and unbalanced look: his assistants have diversified <lb/>
notions as to what is dangerous and what isn't; he <lb/>
can't get time to examine their criticisms in much <lb/>
detail; and so sometimes the very same matter which <lb/>
<pb n="204"/>
is suppressed in one paper fails to be damned in <lb/>
another one, and gets published in full feather and <lb/>
unmodified. Then the paper in which it was sup- <lb/>
pressed blandly copies the forbidden matter into its <lb/>
evening edition&#x2014;provokingly giving credit and <lb/>
detailing all the circumstances in courteous and in- <lb/>
offensive language&#x2014;and of course the censor cannot <lb/>
say a word.</p>
<p>Sometimes the censor sucks all the blood out of a <lb/>
newspaper and leaves it colorless and inane; some- <lb/>
times he leaves it undisturbed, and lets it talk out <lb/>
its opinions with a frankness and vigor hardly to be <lb/>
surpassed, I think, in the journals of any country. <lb/>
Apparently the censor sometimes revises his verdicts <lb/>
upon second thought, for several times lately he has <lb/>
suppressed journals after their issue and partial <lb/>
distribution. The distributed copies are then sent <lb/>
for by the censor and destroyed. I have two of <lb/>
these, but at the time they were sent for I could not <lb/>
remember what I had done with them.</p>
<p>If the censor did his work before the morning <lb/>
edition was printed, he would be less of an incon- <lb/>
venience than he is; but of course the papers can- <lb/>
not wait many minutes after five o'clock to get his <lb/>
verdict; they might as well go out of business as do <lb/>
that; so they print, and take the chances. Then, <lb/>
if they get caught by a suppression, they must strike <lb/>
out the condemned matter and print the edition over <lb/>
again. That delays the issue several hours, and is <lb/>
expensive besides. The government gets the sup- <lb/>
<pb n="205"/>
pressed edition for nothing. If it bought it, that <lb/>
would be joyful, and would give great satisfaction. <lb/>
Also, the edition would be larger. Some of the <lb/>
papers do not replace the condemned paragraphs <lb/>
with other matter; they merely snatch them out and <lb/>
leave blanks behind&#x2014;mourning blanks, marked <lb/>
"<i>Confiscated</i>."</p>
<p>The government discourages the dissemination of <lb/>
newspaper information in other ways. For instance, <lb/>
it does not allow newspapers to be sold on the streets; <lb/>
therefore the newsboy is unknown in Vienna. And <lb/>
there is a stamp duty of nearly a cent upon each <lb/>
copy of a newspaper's issue. Every American paper <lb/>
that reaches me has a stamp upon it, which has been <lb/>
pasted there in the post-office or downstairs in the <lb/>
hotel office; but no matter who put it there, I have <lb/>
to pay for it, and that is the main thing. Sometimes <lb/>
friends send me so many papers that it takes all I <lb/>
can earn that week to keep this government going.</p>
<p>I must take passing notice of another point in the <lb/>
government's measures for maintaining tranquillity. <lb/>
Everybody says it does not like to see any individual <lb/>
attain to commanding influence in the country, since <lb/>
such a man can become a disturber and an incon- <lb/>
venience. "We have as much talent as the other <lb/>
nations," says the citizen, resignedly, and without <lb/>
bitterness, "but for the sake of the general good of <lb/>
the country we are discouraged from making it over- <lb/>
conspicuous; and not only discouraged, but tactfully <lb/>
and skillfully prevented from doing it, if we show <lb/>
<pb n="206"/>
too much persistence. Consequently we have no <lb/>
renowned men; in centuries we have seldom pro- <lb/>
duced one&#x2014;that is, seldom allowed one to produce <lb/>
himself. We can say to-day what no other nation <lb/>
of first importance in the family of Christian civil- <lb/>
izations can say: that there exists no Austrian who <lb/>
has made an enduring name for himself which is fa- <lb/>
miliar all around the globe."</p>
<p>Another helper toward tranquillity is the army. It <lb/>
is as pervasive as the atmosphere. It is everywhere. <lb/>
All the mentioned creators, promoters, and pre- <lb/>
servers of the public tranquillity do their several <lb/>
shares in the quieting work. They make a restful <lb/>
and comfortable serenity and reposefulness. This is <lb/>
disturbed sometimes for a little while: a mob as- <lb/>
sembles to protest against something; it gets noisy <lb/>
&#x2014;noisier&#x2014;still noisier&#x2014;finally <i>too</i> noisy; then <lb/>
the persuasive soldiery come charging down upon it, <lb/>
and in a few minutes all is quiet again, and there is <lb/>
no mob.</p>
<p>There is a Constitution and there is a Parliament. <lb/>
The House draws its membership of 425 deputies <lb/>
from the nineteen or twenty states heretofore men- <lb/>
tioned. These men represent peoples who speak <lb/>
eleven languages. That means eleven distinct varie- <lb/>
ties of jealousies, hostilities, and warring interests. <lb/>
This could be expected to furnish forth a parlia- <lb/>
ment of a pretty inharmonious sort, and make legis- <lb/>
lation difficult at times&#x2014;and it does that. The <lb/>
parliament is split up into many parties&#x2014;the Cler- <lb/>
<pb n="207"/>
icals, the Progressists, the German Nationalists, the <lb/>
Young Czechs, the Social Democrats, the Christian <lb/>
Socialists, and some others&#x2014;and it is difficult to <lb/>
get up working combinations among them. They <lb/>
prefer to fight apart sometimes.</p>
<p>The recent troubles have grown out of Count <lb/>
Badeni's necessities. He could not carry on his <lb/>
government without a majority vote in the House <lb/>
at his back, and in order to secure it he had to make <lb/>
a trade of some sort. He made it with the Czechs <lb/>
&#x2014;the Bohemians. The terms were not easy for <lb/>
him: he must pass a bill making the Czech tongue <lb/>
the official language in Bohemia in place of the <lb/>
German. This created a storm. All the Germans <lb/>
in Austria were incensed. In numbers they form <lb/>
but a fourth part of the empire's population, but <lb/>
they urge that the country's public business should <lb/>
be conducted in one common tongue, and that <lb/>
tongue a world language&#x2014;which German is.</p>
<p>However, Badeni secured his majority. The <lb/>
German element in parliament was apparently <lb/>
become helpless. The Czech deputies were ex- <lb/>
ultant.</p>
<p>Then the music began. Badeni's voyage, instead <lb/>
of being smooth, was disappointingly rough from <lb/>
the start. The government must get the <i>Ausgleich</i> <lb/>
through. It must not fail. Badeni's majority was <lb/>
ready to carry it through; but the minority was <lb/>
determined to obstruct it and delay it until the ob- <lb/>
noxious Czech-language measure should be shelved.</p>
<pb n="208"/>
<p>The <i>Ausgleich</i> is an Adjustment, Arrangement, <lb/>
Settlement, which holds Austria and Hungary to- <lb/>
gether. It dates from 1867, and has to be re- <lb/>
newed every ten years. It establishes the share <lb/>
which Hungary must pay toward the expenses of <lb/>
the imperial government. Hungary is a kingdom <lb/>
(the Emperor of Austria is its King), and has its <lb/>
own parliament and governmental machinery. But <lb/>
it has no foreign office, and it has no army&#x2014;at <lb/>
least its army is a part of the imperial army, is <lb/>
paid out of the imperial treasury, and is under <lb/>
the control of the imperial war office.</p>
<p>The ten-year rearrangement was due a year ago, <lb/>
but failed to connect. At least completely. A <lb/>
year's compromise was arranged. A new arrange- <lb/>
ment must be effected before the last day of this <lb/>
year. Otherwise the two countries become separate <lb/>
entities. The Emperor would still be King of <lb/>
Hungary&#x2014;that is, King of an independent foreign <lb/>
country. There would be Hungarian custom-houses <lb/>
on the Austrian frontier, and there would be a Hun- <lb/>
garian army and a Hungarian foreign office. Both <lb/>
countries would be weakened by this, both would <lb/>
suffer damage.</p>
<p>The Opposition in the House, although in the <lb/>
minority, had a good weapon to fight with in the <lb/>
pending <i>Ausgleich</i>. If it could delay the <i>Ausgleich</i> <lb/>
a few weeks, the government would doubtless have <lb/>
to withdraw the hated language bill or lose Hun- <lb/>
gary.</p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>The Opposition began its fight. Its arms were <lb/>
the Rules of the House. It was soon manifest that <lb/>
by applying these Rules ingeniously it could make <lb/>
the majority helpless, and keep it so as long as it <lb/>
pleased. It could shut off business every now and <lb/>
then with a motion to adjourn. It could require the <lb/>
ayes and noes on the motion, and use up thirty <lb/>
minutes on that detail. It could call for the reading <lb/>
and verification of the minutes of the preceding <lb/>
meeting, and use up half a day in that way. It could <lb/>
require that several of its members be entered upon <lb/>
the list of permitted speakers previously to the open- <lb/>
ing of a sitting; and as there is no time limit, fur- <lb/>
ther delays could thus be accomplished.</p>
<p>These were all lawful weapons, and the men of <lb/>
the Opposition (technically called the Left) were <lb/>
within their rights in using them. They used them <lb/>
to such dire purpose that all parliamentary business <lb/>
was paralyzed. The Right (the government side) <lb/>
could accomplish nothing. Then it had a saving <lb/>
idea. This idea was a curious one. It was to <lb/>
have the President and the Vice-Presidents of the <lb/>
parliament trample the Rules under foot upon oc- <lb/>
casion!</p>
<p>This, for a profoundly embittered minority con- <lb/>
structed out of fire and gun-cotton! It was time <lb/>
for idle strangers to go and ask leave to look <lb/>
down out of a gallery and see what would be the <lb/>
result of it.</p>

<head><smcap>ii. a memorable sitting</smcap></head>
<p>And now took place that memorable sitting of the <lb/>
House which broke two records. It lasted the best <lb/>
part of two days and a night, surpassing by half an <lb/>
hour the longest sitting known to the world's previous <lb/>
parliamentary history, and breaking the long-speech <lb/>
record with Dr. Lecher's twelve-hour effort, the <lb/>
longest flow of unbroken talk that ever came out of <lb/>
one mouth since the world began.</p>
<p>At 8:45, on the evening of the 28th of October, <lb/>
when the House had been sitting a few minutes short <lb/>
of ten hours, Dr. Lecher was granted the floor. It <lb/>
was a good place for theatrical effects. I think that <lb/>
no other Senate House is so shapely as this one, <lb/>
or so richly and showily decorated. Its plan is that <lb/>
of an opera-house. Up toward the straight side of <lb/>
it&#x2014;the stage side&#x2014;rise a couple of terraces of <lb/>
desks for the ministry, and the official clerks or <lb/>
secretaries&#x2014;terraces thirty feet long, and each sup- <lb/>
porting about half a dozen desks with spaces between <lb/>
them. Above these is the President's terrace, against <lb/>
the wall. Along it are distributed the proper accom- <lb/>
modations for the presiding officer and his assistants. <lb/>
The wall is of richly colored marble highly polished, <lb/>
its paneled sweep relieved by fluted columns and <lb/>
pilasters of distinguished grace and dignity, which <lb/>
glow softly and frostily in the electric light. Around <lb/>
the spacious half-circle of the floor bends the great <lb/>
two-storied curve of the boxes, its frontage elaborately <lb/>
ornamented and sumptuously gilded. On the floor <lb/>
<pb n="211"/>
of the House the 425 desks radiate fanwise from the <lb/>
President's tribune.</p>
<p>The galleries are crowded on this particular evening, <lb/>
for word has gone about that the <i>Ausgleich</i> is before <lb/>
the House; that the President, Ritter von Abraham- <lb/>
owicz, has been throttling the Rules; that the <lb/>
Opposition are in an inflammable state in con- <lb/>
sequence, and that the night session is likely to be <lb/>
of an exciting sort.</p>
<p>The gallery guests are fashionably dressed, and <lb/>
the finery of the women makes a bright and pretty <lb/>
show under the strong electric light. But down on <lb/>
the floor there is no costumery.</p>
<p>The deputies are dressed in day clothes; some of <lb/>
the clothes neat and trim, others not; there may be <lb/>
three members in evening dress, but not more. <lb/>
There are several Catholic priests in their long black <lb/>
gowns, and with crucifixes hanging from their necks. <lb/>
No member wears his hat. One may see by these <lb/>
details that the aspects are not those of an evening <lb/>
sitting of an English House of Commons, but rather <lb/>
those of a sitting of our House of Representatives.</p>
<p>In his high place sits the President, Abrahamowicz, <lb/>
object of the Opposition's limitless hatred. He is <lb/>
sunk back in the depths of his arm-chair, and has his <lb/>
chin down. He brings the ends of his spread fingers <lb/>
together in front of his breast, and reflectively taps <lb/>
them together, with the air of one who would like to <lb/>
begin business, but must wait, and be as patient as <lb/>
he can. It makes you think of Richelieu. Now <lb/>
<pb n="212"/>
and then he swings his head up to the left or to the <lb/>
right and answers something which some one has <lb/>
bent down to say to him. Then he taps his fingers <lb/>
again. He looks tired, and maybe a trifle harassed. <lb/>
He is a gray-haired, long, slender man, with a color- <lb/>
less long face, which, in repose, suggests a death- <lb/>
mask; but when not in repose is tossed and rippled <lb/>
by a turbulent smile which washes this way and that, <lb/>
and is not easy to keep up with&#x2014;a pious smile, a <lb/>
holy smile, a saintly smile, a deprecating smile, a <lb/>
beseeching and supplicating smile; and when it is at <lb/>
work the large mouth opens and the flexible lips <lb/>
crumple, and unfold, and crumple again, and move <lb/>
around in a genial and persuasive and angelic way, <lb/>
and expose large glimpses of the teeth; and that <lb/>
interrupts the sacredness of the smile and gives it <lb/>
momentarily a mixed worldly and political and satanic <lb/>
cast. It is a most interesting face to watch. And <lb/>
then the long hands and the body&#x2014;they furnish <lb/>
great and frequent help to the face in the business <lb/>
of adding to the force of the statesman's words.</p>
<p>To change the tense. At the time of which I <lb/>
have just been speaking the crowds in the galleries <lb/>
were gazing at the stage and the pit with rapt interest <lb/>
and expectancy. One half of the great fan of desks <lb/>
was in effect empty, vacant; in the other half several <lb/>
hundred members were bunched and jammed together <lb/>
as solidly as the bristles in a brush; and they also <lb/>
were waiting and expecting. Presently the Chair <lb/>
delivered this utterance:</p>
<pb n="213"/>
<p>"Dr. Lecher has the floor."</p>
<p>Then burst out such another wild and frantic and <lb/>
deafening clamor as has not been heard on this planet <lb/>
since the last time the Comanches surprised a white <lb/>
settlement at midnight. Yells from the Left, counter- <lb/>
yells from the Right, explosions of yells from all <lb/>
sides at once, and all the air sawed and pawed and <lb/>
clawed and cloven by a writhing confusion of gesturing <lb/>
arms and hands. Out of the midst of this thunder <lb/>
and turmoil and tempest rose Dr. Lecher, serene and <lb/>
collected, and the providential length of him enabled <lb/>
his head to show out above it. He began his twelve- <lb/>
hour speech. At any rate, his lips could be seen to <lb/>
move, and that was evidence. On high sat the Presi- <lb/>
dent imploring order, with his long hands put together <lb/>
as in prayer, and his lips visibly but not hearably <lb/>
speaking. At intervals he grasped his bell and swung <lb/>
it up and down with vigor, adding its keen clamor to <lb/>
the storm weltering there below.</p>
<p>Dr. Lecher went on with his pantomime speech, <lb/>
contented, untroubled. Here and there and now and <lb/>
then powerful voices burst above the din, and de- <lb/>
livered an ejaculation that was heard. Then the din <lb/>
ceased for a moment or two, and gave opportunity <lb/>
to hear what the Chair might answer; then the noise <lb/>
broke out again. Apparently the President was being <lb/>
charged with all sorts of illegal exercises of power in <lb/>
the interest of the Right (the government side): <lb/>
among these, with arbitrarily closing an Order of <lb/>
Business before it was finished; with an unfair dis- <lb/>
<pb n="214"/>
tribution of the right to the floor; with refusal of <lb/>
the floor, upon quibble and protest, to members en- <lb/>
titled to it; with stopping a speaker's speech upon <lb/>
quibble and protest; and with other transgressions <lb/>
of the Rules of the House. One of the interrupters <lb/>
who made himself heard was a young fellow of slight <lb/>
build and neat dress, who stood a little apart from <lb/>
the solid crowd and leaned negligently, with folded <lb/>
arms and feet crossed, against a desk. Trim and <lb/>
handsome; strong face and thin features; black hair <lb/>
roughed up; parsimonious mustache; resonant great <lb/>
voice, of good tone and pitch. It is Wolf, capable <lb/>
and hospitable with sword and pistol; fighter of the <lb/>
recent duel with Count Badeni, the head of the <lb/>
government. He shot Badeni through the arm, and <lb/>
then walked over in the politest way and inspected <lb/>
his game, shook hands, expressed regret, and all <lb/>
that. Out of him came early this thundering peal, <lb/>
audible above the storm:</p>
<p>"I demand the floor. I wish to offer a mo- <lb/>
tion."</p>
<p>In the sudden lull which followed, the President <lb/>
answered, "Dr. Lecher has the floor."</p>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i>.</speaker><p>"I move the close of the sitting!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P</i>.</speaker><p>"Representative Lecher has the floor." <lb/>
[Stormy outburst from the Left&#x2014;that is, the <lb/>
Opposition.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i>.</speaker><p>"I demand the floor for the introduction <lb/>
of a formal motion. [Pause.] Mr. President, are <lb/>
you going to grant it, or not? [Crash of approval <lb/>
<pb n="215"/>
from the Left.] I will keep on demanding the floor <lb/>
till I get it."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P.</i></speaker><p>"I call Representative Wolf to order. Dr. <lb/>
Lecher has the floor."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i>.</speaker><p>"Mr. President, are you going to observe <lb/>
the Rules of this House?" [Tempest of applause <lb/>
and confused ejaculations from the Left&#x2014;a boom <lb/>
and roar which long endured, and stopped all busi- <lb/>
ness for the time being.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. von Pessler</i>.</speaker><p>"By the Rules motions are in <lb/>
order, and the Chair <i>must</i> put them to vote."</p>
<p>For answer the President (who is a Pole&#x2014;I make <lb/>
this remark in passing) began to jangle his bell with <lb/>
energy at the moment that that wild pandemonium <lb/>
of voices burst out again.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (hearable above the storm).</speaker><p>"Mr. Presi- <lb/>
dent, I demand the floor. We intend to find out, <lb/>
here and now, which is the hardest, <i>a Pole's skull or <lb/>
a German's!</i>"</p>
<p>This brought out a perfect cyclone of satisfaction <lb/>
from the Left. In the midst of it some one again <lb/>
moved an adjournment. The President blandly <lb/>
answered that Dr. Lecher had the floor. Which was <lb/>
true; and he was speaking, too, calmly, earnestly, <lb/>
and argumentatively; and the official stenographers <lb/>
had left their places and were at his elbows taking <lb/>
down his words, he leaning and orating into their ears <lb/>
&#x2014;a most curious and interesting scene.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. von Pessler</i> (to the Chair).</speaker><p>"Do not drive <lb/>
us to extremities!"</p>
<pb n="216"/>
<p>The tempest burst out again; yells of approval <lb/>
from the Left, catcalls, an ironical laughter from <lb/>
the Right. At this point a new and most effective <lb/>
noisemaker was pressed into service. Each desk has <lb/>
an extension, consisting of a removable board <lb/>
eighteen inches long, six wide, and a half-inch thick. <lb/>
A member pulled one of these out and began to <lb/>
belabor the top of his desk with it. Instantly other <lb/>
members followed suit, and perhaps you can imagine <lb/>
the result. Of all conceivable rackets it is the most <lb/>
ear-splitting, intolerable, and altogether fiendish.</p>
<p>The persecuted President leaned back in his chair, <lb/>
closed his eyes, clasped his hands in his lap, and a <lb/>
look of pathetic resignation crept over his long face. <lb/>
It is the way a country schoolmaster used to look in <lb/>
days long past when he had refused his school a <lb/>
holiday and it had risen against him in ill-mannered <lb/>
riot and violence and insurrection. Twice a motion <lb/>
to adjourn had been offered&#x2014;a motion always in <lb/>
order in other Houses, and doubtless so in this one <lb/>
also. The President had refused to put these motions. <lb/>
By consequence, he was not in a pleasant place now, <lb/>
and was having a right hard time. Votes upon <lb/>
motions, whether carried or defeated, could make <lb/>
endless delay, and postpone the <i>Ausgleich</i> to next <lb/>
century.</p>
<p>In the midst of these sorrowful circumstances and <lb/>
this hurricane of yells and screams and satanic clatter <lb/>
of desk-boards, Representative Dr. Kronawetter un- <lb/>
feelingly reminds the Chair that a motion has been <lb/>
<pb n="217"/>
offered, and adds: "Say yes, or no! What do <lb/>
you sit there for, and give no answer?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P.</i></speaker><p>"After I have given a speaker the floor, I <lb/>
cannot give it to another. After Dr. Lecher is <lb/>
through, I will put your motion." [Storm of in- <lb/>
dignation from the Left.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (to the Chair).</speaker><p>"Thunder and lightning! <lb/>
look at the Rule governing the case!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Kronawetter</i>.</speaker><p>"I move the close of the sitting! <lb/>
And I demand the ayes and noes!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Lecher</i>.</speaker><p>"Mr. President, have I the floor?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P.</i></speaker><p>"You have the floor."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (to the Chair, in a stentorian voice which <lb/>
cleaves its way through the storm).</speaker><p>"It is by such <lb/>
brutalities as these that you drive us to extremities! <lb/>
Are you waiting till some one shall throw into your <lb/>
face the word that shall describe what you are bringing <lb/>
about?<ref target="n12">*</ref><note id="n12" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>That is, <i>revolution</i>.</p></note> [Tempest of insulted fury from the Right.] <lb/>
<i>Is that what you are waiting for, old Grayhead?</i>" <lb/>
[Long-continued clatter of desk-boards from the Left, <lb/>
with shouts of "The vote! the vote!" An ironical <lb/>
shout from the Right, "Wolf is boss!"]</p>
<p>Wolf keeps on demanding the floor for his motion. <lb/>
At length&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P.</i></speaker><p>"I call Representative Wolf to order! Your <lb/>
conduct is unheard-of, sir! You forget that you are <lb/>
in a parliament; you must remember where you are, <lb/>
sir." [Applause from the Right. Dr. Lecher is still <lb/>
<pb n="218"/>
peacefully speaking, the stenographers listening at <lb/>
his lips.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (banging on his desk with his desk-board).</speaker><p>"I demand the floor for my motion! I won't stand <lb/>
this trampling of the Rules under foot&#x2014;no, not if <lb/>
I die for it! I will never yield! You have got to stop <lb/>
me by force. Have I the floor?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P.</i></speaker><p>"Representative Wolf, what kind of behavior <lb/>
is this? I call you to order again. You should have <lb/>
some regard for your dignity."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dr. Lecher speaks on.</speaker><p>Wolf turns upon him with <lb/>
an offensive innuendo.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Lecher</i>.</speaker><p>"Mr. Wolf, I beg you to refrain <lb/>
from that sort of suggestions." [Storm of hand- <lb/>
clapping from the Right.]</p>
<p>This was applause from the enemy, for Lecher <lb/>
himself, like Wolf, was an Obstructionist.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Wolf growls to Lecher:</speaker><p>"You can scribble that <lb/>
applause in your album!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P.</i></speaker><p>"Once more I call Representative Wolf to <lb/>
order! Do not forget that you are a Representative, <lb/>
sir!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (slam-banging with his desk-board).</speaker><p>"I <lb/>
will force this matter! Are you going to grant me <lb/>
the floor, or not?"</p>
<p>And still the sergeant-at-arms did not appear. It <lb/>
was because there wasn't any. It is a curious thing, <lb/>
but the Chair has no effectual means of compelling <lb/>
order.</p>
<p>After some more interruptions:</p></sp>
<pb n="219"/>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (banging with his board).</speaker><p>"I demand the <lb/>
floor. I will not yield!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>P.</i></speaker><p>"I have no recourse against Representative <lb/>
Wolf. In the presence of behavior like this it is to <lb/>
be regretted that such is the case." [A shout from <lb/>
the Right, "Throw him out!"]</p>
<p>It is true, he had no effective recourse. He had <lb/>
an official called an "Ordner," whose help he could <lb/>
invoke in desperate cases, but apparently the Ordner <lb/>
is only a persuader, not a compeller. Apparently <lb/>
he is a sergeant-at-arms who is not loaded; a good <lb/>
enough gun to look at, but not valuable for business.</p>
<p>For another twenty or thirty minutes Wolf went <lb/>
on banging with his board and demanding his rights; <lb/>
then at last the weary President threatened to sum- <lb/>
mon the dread order-maker. But both his manner <lb/>
and his words were reluctant. Evidently it grieved <lb/>
him to have to resort to this dire extremity. He <lb/>
said to Wolf, "If this goes on, I shall feel obliged <lb/>
to summon the Ordner, and beg him to restore <lb/>
order in the House."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i>.</speaker><p>"I'd like to see you do it! Suppose you <lb/>
fetch in a few policemen, too! [Great tumult.] <lb/>
Are you going to put my motion to adjourn, or <lb/>
not?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dr. Lecher continues his speech.</speaker><p>Wolf accom- <lb/>
panies him with his board-clatter.</p>
<p>The President despatches the Ordner, Dr. Lang <lb/>
(himself a deputy), on his order-restoring mission. <lb/>
Wolf, with his board uplifted for defence, confronts <lb/>
<pb n="220"/>
the Ordner with a remark which Boss Tweed might <lb/>
have translated into "Now let's see what you are <lb/>
going to do about it!" [Noise and tumult all over <lb/>
the House.]</p>
<p>Wolf stands upon his rights, and says he will main- <lb/>
tain them till he is killed in his tracks. Then he re- <lb/>
sumes his banging, the President jangles his bell <lb/>
and begs for order, and the rest of the House aug- <lb/>
ments the racket the best it can.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i>.</speaker><p>"I require an adjournment, because I find <lb/>
myself personally threatened. [Laughter from the <lb/>
Right.] Not that I fear for myself; I am only <lb/>
anxious about what will happen to the man who <lb/>
touches me."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Ordner</i>.</speaker><p>"I am not going to fight with you."</p></sp>
<p>Nothing came of the efforts of the angel of peace, <lb/>
and he presently melted out of the scene and dis- <lb/>
appeared. Wolf went on with his noise and with his <lb/>
demands that he be granted the floor, resting his <lb/>
board at intervals to discharge criticisms and epithets <lb/>
at the Chair. Once he reminded the Chairman of <lb/>
his violated promise to grant him (Wolf) the floor, <lb/>
and said, "Whence I came, we call promise-breakers <lb/>
rascals!" And he advised the Chairman to take his <lb/>
conscience to bed with him and use it as a pillow. <lb/>
Another time he said that the Chair was making itself <lb/>
ridiculous before all Europe. In fact, some of Wolf's <lb/>
language was almost unparliamentary. By-and-by he <lb/>
struck the idea of beating out a <i>tune</i> with his board. <lb/>
Later he decided to stop asking for the floor, and <lb/>
<pb n="221"/>
to confer it upon himself. And so he and Dr. <lb/>
Lecher now spoke at the same time, and mingled <lb/>
their speeches with the other noises, and nobody <lb/>
heard either of them. Wolf rested himself now and <lb/>
then from speech-making by reading, in his clarion <lb/>
voice, from a pamphlet.</p>
<p>I will explain that Dr. Lecher was not making <lb/>
a twelve-hour speech for pastime, but for an im- <lb/>
portant purpose. It was the government's intention <lb/>
to push the <i>Ausgleich</i> through its preliminary stages <lb/>
in this one sitting (for which it was the Order of the <lb/>
Day), and then by vote refer it to a select committee. <lb/>
It was the Majority's scheme&#x2014;as charged by the <lb/>
Opposition&#x2014;to drown debate upon the bill by pure <lb/>
noise&#x2014;drown it out and stop it. The debate being <lb/>
thus ended, the vote upon the reference would follow <lb/>
&#x2014;with victory for the government. But into the <lb/>
government's calculations had not entered the <lb/>
possibility of a single-barreled speech which should <lb/>
occupy the entire time-limit of the sitting, and also <lb/>
get itself delivered in spite of all the noise. Goliah <lb/>
was not expecting David. But David was there; <lb/>
and during twelve hours he tranquilly pulled statis- <lb/>
tical, historical, and argumentative pebbles out of his <lb/>
scrip and slung them at the giant; and when he was <lb/>
done he was victor, and the day was saved.</p>
<p>In the English House an obstructionist has held <lb/>
the floor with Bible-readings and other outside <lb/>
matters; but Dr. Lecher could not have that restful <lb/>
and recuperative privilege&#x2014;he must confine himself <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
strictly to the subject before the House. More than <lb/>
once, when the President could not hear him because <lb/>
of the general tumult, he sent persons to listen and <lb/>
report as to whether the orator was speaking to the <lb/>
subject or not.</p>
<p>The subject was a peculiarly difficult one, and it <lb/>
would have troubled any other deputy to stick to it <lb/>
three hours without exhausting his ammunition, <lb/>
because it required a vast and intimate knowledge&#x2014; <lb/>
detailed and particularized knowledge&#x2014;of the com- <lb/>
mercial, railroading, financial, and international bank- <lb/>
ing relations existing between two great sovereignties, <lb/>
Hungary and the Empire. But Dr. Lecher is Presi- <lb/>
dent of the Board of Trade of his city of Br&#x00FC;nn, and <lb/>
was master of the situation. His speech was not <lb/>
formally prepared. He had a few notes jotted down <lb/>
for his guidance; he had his facts in his head; his <lb/>
heart was in his work; and for twelve hours he stood <lb/>
there, undisturbed by the clamor around him, and <lb/>
with grace and ease and confidence poured out the <lb/>
riches of his mind, in closely reasoned arguments, <lb/>
clothed in eloquent and faultless phrasing.</p>
<p>He is a young man of thirty-seven. He is tall <lb/>
and well-proportioned, and has cultivated and forti- <lb/>
fied his muscle by mountain-climbing. If he were a <lb/>
little handsomer he would sufficiently reproduce for <lb/>
me the Chauncey Depew of the great New England <lb/>
dinner nights of some years ago; he has Depew's <lb/>
charm of manner and graces of language and <lb/>
delivery.</p>
<pb n="223"/>
<p>There was but one way for Dr. Lecher to hold the <lb/>
floor&#x2014;he must stay on his legs. If he should sit <lb/>
down to rest a moment, the floor would be taken <lb/>
from him by the enemy in the Chair. When he had <lb/>
been talking three or four hours he himself proposed <lb/>
an adjournment, in order that he might get some rest <lb/>
from his wearing labors; but he limited his motion <lb/>
with the condition that if it was lost he should be <lb/>
allowed to continue his speech, and if it carried he <lb/>
should have the floor at the next sitting. Wolf was <lb/>
now appeased, and withdrew his own thousand-times <lb/>
offered motion, and Dr. Lecher's was voted upon&#x2014; <lb/>
and lost. So he went on speaking.</p>
<p>By one o'clock in the morning, excitement and <lb/>
noise-making had tired out nearly everybody but the <lb/>
orator. Gradually the seats of the Right underwent <lb/>
depopulation; the occupants had slipped out to the <lb/>
refreshment-rooms to eat and drink, or to the cor- <lb/>
ridors to chat. Some one remarked that there was <lb/>
no longer a quorum present, and moved a call of the <lb/>
House. The Chair (Vice-President Dr. Kramarz) <lb/>
refused to put it to vote. There was a small dispute <lb/>
over the legality of this ruling, but the Chair held its <lb/>
ground.</p>
<p>The Left remained on the battle-field to support <lb/>
their champion. He went steadily on with his speech; <lb/>
and always it was strong, virile, felicitous, and to <lb/>
the point. He was earning applause, and this enabled <lb/>
his party to turn that fact to account. Now and then <lb/>
they applauded him a couple of minutes on a stretch, <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
and during that time he could stop speaking and rest <lb/>
his voice without having the floor taken from him.</p>
<p>At a quarter to two a member of the Left de- <lb/>
manded that Dr. Lecher be allowed a recess for rest, <lb/>
and said that the Chairman was "heartless." Dr. <lb/>
Lecher himself asked for ten minutes. The Chair <lb/>
allowed him five. Before the time had run out Dr. <lb/>
Lecher was on his feet again.</p>
<p>Wolf burst out again with a motion to adjourn. <lb/>
Refused by the Chair. Wolf said the whole par- <lb/>
liament wasn't worth a pinch of powder. The <lb/>
Chair retorted that that was true in a case where <lb/>
a single member was able to make all parliamentary <lb/>
business impossible. Dr. Lecher continued his <lb/>
speech.</p>
<p>The members of the Majority went out by detach- <lb/>
ments from time to time and took naps upon sofas <lb/>
in the reception-rooms; and also refreshed them- <lb/>
selves with food and drink&#x2014;in quantities nearly <lb/>
unbelievable&#x2014;but the Minority staid loyally by <lb/>
their champion. Some distinguished deputies of the <lb/>
Majority staid by him, too, compelled thereto by <lb/>
admiration of his great performance. When a man <lb/>
has been speaking eight hours, is it conceivable that <lb/>
he can still be interesting, still fascinating? When <lb/>
Dr. Lecher had been speaking eight hours he was <lb/>
still compactly surrounded by friends who would not <lb/>
leave him and by foes (of all parties) who <i>could</i> not; <lb/>
and all hung enchanted and wondering upon his <lb/>
words, and all testified their admiration with constant <lb/>
<pb n="225"/>
and cordial outbursts of applause. Surely this was <lb/>
a triumph without precedent in history.</p>
<p>During the twelve-hour effort friends brought to <lb/>
the orator three glasses of wine, four cups of coffee, <lb/>
and one glass of beer&#x2014;a most stingy re-enforce- <lb/>
ment of his wasting tissues, but the hostile Chair <lb/>
would permit no addition to it. But no matter, the <lb/>
Chair could not beat that man. He was a garrison <lb/>
holding a fort, and was not to be starved out.</p>
<p>When he had been speaking eight hours his pulse <lb/>
was 72; when he had spoken twelve, it was 100.</p>
<p>He finished his long speech in these terms, as <lb/>
nearly as a permissibly free translation can convey <lb/>
them:</p>
<p>"I will now hasten to close my examination of <lb/>
the subject. I conceive that we of the Left have <lb/>
made it clear to the honorable gentlemen of the other <lb/>
side of the House that we are stirred by no in- <lb/>
temperate enthusiasm for this measure in its present <lb/>
shape&#x2026;.</p>
<p>"What we require, and shall fight for with all <lb/>
lawful weapons, is a formal, comprehensive, and <lb/>
definitive solution and settlement of these vexed <lb/>
matters. We desire the restoration of the earlier <lb/>
condition of things; the cancellation of all this in- <lb/>
capable government's pernicious trades with Hun- <lb/>
gary; and then&#x2014;release from the sorry burden of <lb/>
the Badeni ministry!</p>
<p>"I voice the hope&#x2014;I know not if it will be ful- <lb/>
filled&#x2014;I voice the deep and sincere and patriotic <lb/>
<pb n="226"/>
hope that the committee into whose hands this bill <lb/>
will eventually be committed will take its stand upon <lb/>
high ground, and will return the <i>Ausgleich-Pro- <lb/>
visorium</i> to this House in a form which shall make <lb/>
it the protector and promoter alike of the great <lb/>
interests involved and of the honor of our father- <lb/>
land." After a pause, turning toward the govern- <lb/>
ment benches: "But in any case, gentlemen of the <lb/>
Majority, make sure of this: henceforth, as before, <lb/>
you will find us at our post. The Germans of Austria <lb/>
will neither surrender nor die!"</p>
<p>Then burst a storm of applause which rose and <lb/>
fell, rose and fell, burst out again and again and <lb/>
again, explosion after explosion, hurricane after <lb/>
hurricane, with no apparent promise of ever coming <lb/>
to an end; and meantime the whole Left was surging <lb/>
and weltering about the champion, all bent upon <lb/>
wringing his hand and congratulating him and glori- <lb/>
fying him.</p>
<p>Finally he got away, and went home and ate five <lb/>
loaves and twelve baskets of fishes, read the morning <lb/>
papers, slept three hours, took a short drive, then <lb/>
returned to the House and sat out the rest of the <lb/>
thirty-three-hour session.</p>
<p>To merely <i>stand up</i> in one spot twelve hours on <lb/>
a stretch is a feat which very few men could achieve; <lb/>
to add to the task the utterance of a hundred thousand <lb/>
words would be beyond the possibilities of the most <lb/>
of those few; to superimpose the requirement that <lb/>
the words should be put into the form of a compact, <lb/>
<pb n="227"/>
coherent, and symmetrical oration would probably <lb/>
rule out the rest of the few, bar Dr. Lecher.</p>
</div3>

<head><smcap>iii. curious parliamentary etiquette</smcap></head>
<p>In consequence of Dr. Lecher's twelve-hour speech <lb/>
and the other obstructions furnished by the Minority, <lb/>
the famous thirty-three-hour sitting of the House <lb/>
accomplished nothing. The government side had <lb/>
made a supreme effort, assisting itself with all the <lb/>
helps at hand, both lawful and unlawful, yet had <lb/>
failed to get the <i>Ausgleich</i> into the hands of a com- <lb/>
mittee. This was a severe defeat. The Right was <lb/>
mortified, the Left jubilant.</p>
<p>Parliament was adjourned for a week&#x2014;to let the <lb/>
members cool off, perhaps&#x2014;a sacrifice of precious <lb/>
time, for but two months remained in which to carry <lb/>
the all-important <i>Ausgleich</i> to a consummation.</p>
<p>If I have reported the behavior of the House in- <lb/>
telligibly, the reader has been surprised at it, and has <lb/>
wondered whence these law-makers come and what <lb/>
they are made of; and he has probably supposed <lb/>
that the conduct exhibited at the Long Sitting was <lb/>
far out of the common, and due to special excite- <lb/>
ment and irritation. As to the make-up of the <lb/>
House, it is this: the deputies come from all the <lb/>
walks of life and from all the grades of society. <lb/>
There are princes, counts, barons, priests, peasants, <lb/>
mechanics, laborers, lawyers, judges, physicians, <lb/>
professors, merchants, bankers, shopkeepers. They <lb/>
are religious men, they are earnest, sincere, de- <lb/>
<pb n="228"/>
voted, and they hate the Jews. The title of <lb/>
Doctor is so common in the House that one may <lb/>
almost say that the deputy who does not bear it is <lb/>
by that reason conspicuous. I am assured that it is <lb/>
not a self-granted title, and not an honorary one, but <lb/>
an <i>earned</i> one; that in Austria it is very seldom con- <lb/>
ferred as a mere compliment; that in Austria the <lb/>
degrees of Doctor of Music, Doctor of Philosophy, <lb/>
and so on, are not conferred by the seats of learning; <lb/>
and so, when an Austrian is called Doctor it means <lb/>
that he is either a lawyer or a physician, and that <lb/>
he is not a self-educated man, but is college-bred, <lb/>
and has been diplomaed for merit.</p>
<p>That answers the question of the constitution of <lb/>
the House. Now as to the House's curious manners. <lb/>
The manners exhibited by this convention of Doctors <lb/>
were not at that time being tried as a wholly new ex- <lb/>
periment. I will go back to a previous sitting in <lb/>
order to show that the deputies had already had some <lb/>
practice.</p>
<p>There had been an incident. The dignity of the <lb/>
House had been wounded by improprieties indulged <lb/>
in in its presence by a couple of the members. This <lb/>
matter was placed in the hands of a committee to <lb/>
determine where the guilt lay, and the degree of it, <lb/>
and also to suggest the punishment. The chairman <lb/>
of the committee brought in his report. By this it <lb/>
appeared that, in the course of a speech, Deputy <lb/>
Schrammel said that religion had no proper place <lb/>
in the public schools&#x2014;it was a private matter. <lb/>
<pb n="229"/>
Whereupon Deputy Gregorig shouted, "How about <lb/>
free love!"</p>
<p>To this, Deputy Iro flung out this retort: "Soda- <lb/>
water at the Wimberger!"</p>
<p>This appeared to deeply offend Deputy Gregorig, <lb/>
who shouted back at Iro, "You cowardly blather- <lb/>
skite, say that again!"</p>
<p>The committee had sat three hours. Gregorig <lb/>
had apologized; Iro had explained. Iro explained <lb/>
that he didn't say anything about soda-water at the <lb/>
Wimberger. He explained in writing, and was very <lb/>
explicit: "I declare <i>upon my word of honor</i> that I <lb/>
did not say the words attributed to me."</p>
<p>Unhappily for his word of honor it was proved by <lb/>
the official stenographers and by the testimony of <lb/>
several deputies that he <i>did</i> say them.</p>
<p>The committee did not officially know why the <lb/>
apparently inconsequential reference to soda-water <lb/>
at the Wimberger should move Deputy Gregorig to <lb/>
call the utterer of it a cowardly blatherskite; still, <lb/>
after proper deliberation, it was of the opinion that <lb/>
the House ought to formally censure the whole busi- <lb/>
ness. This verdict seems to have been regarded as <lb/>
sharply severe. I think so because Deputy Dr. <lb/>
Lueger, B&#x00FC;rgermeister of Vienna, felt it a duty to <lb/>
soften the blow to his friend Gregorig by showing <lb/>
that the soda-water remark was not so innocuous as <lb/>
it might look; that indeed Gregorig's tough retort <lb/>
was justifiable&#x2014;and he proceeded to explain why. <lb/>
He read a number of scandalous post-cards which <lb/>
<pb n="230"/>
he intimated had proceeded from Iro, as indicated <lb/>
by the handwriting, though they were anonymous. <lb/>
Some of them were posted to Gregorig at his place <lb/>
of business, and could have been read by all his <lb/>
subordinates; the others were posted <i>to Gregorig's <lb/>
wife</i>. Lueger did not say&#x2014;but everybody knew <lb/>
&#x2014;that the cards referred to a matter of town gossip <lb/>
which made Mr. Gregorig a chief actor in a tavern <lb/>
scene where siphon squirting played a prominent and <lb/>
humorous part, and wherein women had a share.</p>
<p>There were several of the cards; more than several, <lb/>
in fact; no fewer than five were sent in one day. <lb/>
Dr. Lueger read some of them, and described others. <lb/>
Some of them had pictures on them; one a picture <lb/>
of a hog with a monstrous snout, and beside it <lb/>
a squirting soda-siphon; below it some sarcastic <lb/>
doggerel.</p>
<p>Gregorig deals in shirts, cravats, etc. One of the <lb/>
cards bore these words: "Much respected Deputy <lb/>
and collar-sewer&#x2014;or <i>stealer</i>."</p>
<p>Another: "Hurrah for the Christian-Social work <lb/>
among the women-assemblages! Hurrah for the <lb/>
soda-squirter!" Comment by Dr. Lueger: "I <lb/>
cannot venture to read the rest of that one, nor <lb/>
the signature, either."</p>
<p>Another: "Would you mind telling me if &#x2026;"</p>
<p>Comment by Dr. Lueger: "The rest of it is <lb/>
not properly readable."</p>
<p>To Deputy Gregorig's wife: "Much respected <lb/>
Madam Gregorig,&#x2014;The undersigned desires an <lb/>
<pb n="231"/>
invitation to the next soda-squirt." Comment by <lb/>
Dr. Lueger: "Neither the rest of the card nor the <lb/>
signature can I venture to read to the House, so <lb/>
vulgar are they."</p>
<p>The purpose of this card&#x2014;to expose Gregorig <lb/>
to his family&#x2014;was repeated in others of these <lb/>
anonymous missives.</p>
<p>The House, by vote, censured the two improper <lb/>
deputies.</p>
<p>This may have had a modifying effect upon the <lb/>
phraseology of the membership for awhile, and upon <lb/>
its general exuberance also, but it was not for long. <lb/>
As has been seen, it had become lively once more <lb/>
on the night of the Long Sitting. At the next <lb/>
sitting after the long one there was certainly no lack <lb/>
of liveliness. The President was persistently ignor- <lb/>
ing the Rules of the House in the interest of the <lb/>
government side, and the Minority were in an <lb/>
unappeasable fury about it. The ceaseless din <lb/>
and uproar, the shouting and stamping and desk- <lb/>
banging, were deafening, but through it all burst <lb/>
voices now and then that made themselves heard. <lb/>
Some of the remarks were of a very candid sort, <lb/>
and I believe that if they had been uttered in <lb/>
our House of Representatives they would have at- <lb/>
tracted attention. I will insert some samples here. <lb/>
Not in their order, but selected on their merits:</p>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Mayreder</i> (to the President).</speaker><p>"You have <lb/>
lied! You conceded the floor to me; make it good, <lb/>
or you have lied!"</p></sp>
<pb n="232"/>
<sp><speaker><i>Mr. Gl&#x00F6;ckner</i> (to the President).</speaker><p>"Leave! Get <lb/>
out!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (indicating the President).</speaker><p>"There sits a <lb/>
man to whom a certain title belongs!"</p>
<p>Unto Wolf, who is continuously reading, in a <lb/>
powerful voice, from a newspaper, arrive these per- <lb/>
sonal remarks from the Majority: "Oh, shut your <lb/>
mouth!" "Put him out!" "Out with him!" <lb/>
Wolf stops reading a moment to shout at Dr. Lueger, <lb/>
who has the floor, but cannot get a hearing, "Please, <lb/>
Betrayer of the People, begin!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Lueger</i>.</speaker><p>"Meine Herren&#x2014;" ["Oho!" and <lb/>
groans.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i>.</speaker><p>"<i>That's</i> the holy light of the Christian <lb/>
Socialists!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Mr. Kletzenbauer</i> (Christian Socialist).</speaker><p>"Dam <lb/>
&#x2014;nation! are you ever going to quiet down?"</p>
<p>Wolf discharges a galling remark at Mr. Wohl- <lb/>
meyer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wohlmeyer</i> (responding).</speaker><p>"You Jew, you!"</p>
<p>There is a moment's lull, and Dr. Lueger begins <lb/>
his speech. Graceful, handsome man, with winning <lb/>
manners and attractive bearing, a bright and easy <lb/>
speaker, and is said to know how to trim his political <lb/>
sails to catch any favoring wind that blows. He <lb/>
manages to say a few words, then the tempest over- <lb/>
whelms him again.</p>
<p>Wolf stops reading his paper a moment to say a <lb/>
drastic thing about Lueger and his Christian-Social <lb/>
pieties, which sets the C. S.'s in a sort of frenzy.</p></sp>
<pb n="233"/>
<sp><speaker><i>Mr. Vielohlawek</i>.</speaker><p>"You leave the Christian <lb/>
Socialists alone, you word-of-honor-breaker! Ob- <lb/>
struct all you want to, but you leave <i>them</i> alone! <lb/>
You've no business in this House; you belong in a <lb/>
gin-mill!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Mr. Prochazka</i>.</speaker><p>"In a lunatic-asylum, you <lb/>
mean!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Vielohlawek</i>.</speaker><p>"It's a pity that such a man should <lb/>
be leader of the Germans; he disgraces the German <lb/>
name!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Scheicher</i>.</speaker><p>"It's a shame that the like of him <lb/>
should insult us."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Strohbach</i> (to Wolf).</speaker><p>"Contemptible cub&#x2014;we <lb/>
will bounce thee out of this!" [It is inferable that <lb/>
the "thee" is not intended to indicate affection this <lb/>
time, but to re-enforce and emphasize Mr. Stroh- <lb/>
bach's scorn.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Scheicher</i>.</speaker><p>"His insults are of no consequence. <lb/>
He wants his ears boxed."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Lueger</i> (to Wolf).</speaker><p>"You'd better worry a <lb/>
trifle over your Iro's word of honor. You are <lb/>
behaving like a street arab."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Scheicher</i>.</speaker><p>"It's infamous!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Lueger</i>.</speaker><p>"And <i>these</i> shameless creatures are <lb/>
the leaders of the German People's Party!"</p>
<p>Meantime Wolf goes whooping along with his <lb/>
newspaper-readings in great contentment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Pattai</i>.</speaker><p>"Shut up! Shut up! Shut <i>up!</i> You <lb/>
haven't the floor!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Strohbach</i>.</speaker><p>"The miserable cub!"</p></sp>
<pb n="234"/>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Lueger</i> (to Wolf, raising his voice strenuously <lb/>
above the storm).</speaker><p>"You are a wholly honorless <lb/>
street brat!" [A voice, "Fire the rapscallion out!" <lb/>
But Wolf's soul goes marching noisily on, just the <lb/>
same.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Sch&#x00F6;nerer</i> (vast and muscular, and endowed with <lb/>
the most powerful voice in the Reichsrath; comes <lb/>
ploughing down through the standing crowds, red, <lb/>
and choking with anger; halts before Deputy Wohl- <lb/>
meyer, grabs a rule and smashes it with a blow upon <lb/>
a desk, threatens Wohlmeyer's face with his fist, <lb/>
and bellows out some personalities, and a promise).</speaker><p>"Only you wait&#x2014;we'll teach you!" [A whirl- <lb/>
wind of offensive retorts assails him from the band <lb/>
of meek and humble Christian Socialists compacted <lb/>
around their leader, that distinguished religious ex- <lb/>
pert, Dr. Lueger, B&#x00FC;rgermeister of Vienna. Our <lb/>
breath comes in excited gasps now, and we are <lb/>
full of hope. We imagine that we are back fifty <lb/>
years ago in the Arkansas Legislature, and we <lb/>
think we know what is going to happen, and are <lb/>
glad we came, and glad we are up in the gallery, <lb/>
out of the way, where we can see the whole <lb/>
thing and yet not have to supply any of the <lb/>
material for the inquest. However, as it turns <lb/>
out, our confidence is abused, our hopes are mis- <lb/>
placed.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Pattai</i> (wildly excited).</speaker><p>"You quiet down, or <lb/>
we shall turn ourselves loose! There will be a cuffing <lb/>
of ears!"</p></sp>
<pb n="235"/>
<sp><speaker><i>Prochazka</i> (in a fury).</speaker><p>"No&#x2014;<i>not</i> ear-boxing, <lb/>
but genuine <i>blows!</i>"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Vielohlawek</i>.</speaker><p>"I would rather take my hat off to <lb/>
a Jew than to Wolf!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Strohbach</i> (to Wolf).</speaker><p>"Jew-flunky! Here we <lb/>
have been fighting the Jews for ten years, and now <lb/>
you are helping them to power again. How much <lb/>
do you get for it?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Holansky</i>.</speaker><p>"What he wants is a strait-jacket!"</p>
<p>Wolf continues his readings. It is a market re- <lb/>
port now.</p>
<p>Remark flung across the House to Sch&#x00F6;nerer: "<i>Die Grossmutter auf dem Misthaufen erzeugt <lb/>
worden!</i>"</p>
<p>It will be judicious not to translate that. Its flavor <lb/>
is pretty high, in any case, but it becomes particularly <lb/>
gamey when you remember that the first gallery was <lb/>
well stocked with ladies.</p>
<p>Apparently it was a great hit. It fetched thunders <lb/>
of joyous enthusiasm out of the Christian Socialists, <lb/>
and in their rapture they flung biting epithets with <lb/>
wasteful liberality at specially detested members of <lb/>
the Opposition; among others, this one at Sch&#x00F6;nerer: <lb/>
"<i>Bordell in der Krugerstrasse!</i>" Then they added <lb/>
these words, which they whooped, howled, and also <lb/>
even sang, in a deep-voiced chorus: "<i>Schmul Leeb <lb/>
Kohn! Schmul Leeb Kohn! Schmul Leeb Kohn!</i>" <lb/>
and made it splendidly audible above the banging of <lb/>
desk-boards and the rest of the roaring cyclone of <lb/>
fiendish noises. [A gallery witticism comes flitting <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
by from mouth to mouth around the great curve: <lb/>
"The swan-song of Austrian representative gov- <lb/>
ernment!" You can note its progress by the <lb/>
applausive smiles and nods it gets as it skims <lb/>
along.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Kletzenbauer</i>.</speaker><p>"Holofernes, where is Judith?" <lb/>
[Storm of laughter.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Gregorig</i> (the shirt-merchant).</speaker><p>"This Wolf- <lb/>
Theater is costing 6,000 florins!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (with sweetness).</speaker><p>"Notice him, gentlemen; <lb/>
it is Mr. Gregorig." [Laughter.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Vielohlawek</i> (to Wolf).</speaker><p>"You Judas!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Schneider</i>.</speaker><p>"Brothel-Knight!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Chorus of Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"East-German offal-tub!"</p>
<p>And so the war of epithets crashes along, with <lb/>
never-diminishing energy, for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The ladies in the gallery were learning. That was <lb/>
well; for by-and-by ladies will form a part of the <lb/>
membership of all the legislatures in the world; as <lb/>
soon as they can prove competency they will be <lb/>
admitted. At present, men only are competent to <lb/>
legislate; therefore they look down upon women, <lb/>
and would feel degraded if they had to have them <lb/>
for colleagues in their high calling.</p>
<p>Wolf is yelling another market report now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Gessman</i>.</speaker><p>"Shut up, infamous louse-brat!"</p>
<p>During a momentary lull Dr. Lueger gets a hearing <lb/>
for three sentences of his speech. They demand <lb/>
and require that the President shall suppress the four <lb/>
noisiest members of the Opposition.</p></sp>
<pb n="237"/>
<sp><speaker><i>Wolf</i> (with a that-settles-it toss of the head).</speaker><p>"The shifty trickster of Vienna has spoken!"</p>
<p>Iro belonged to Sch&#x00F6;nerer's party. The word-of- <lb/>
honor incident has given it a new name. Gregorig <lb/>
is a Christian Socialist, and hero of the post-cards <lb/>
and the Wimberger soda-squirting incident. He <lb/>
stands vast and conspicuous, and conceited and self- <lb/>
satisfied, and roosterish and inconsequential, at <lb/>
Lueger's elbow, and is proud and cocky to be in <lb/>
such great company. He looks very well indeed; <lb/>
really majestic, and aware of it. He crows out his <lb/>
little empty remark, now and then, and looks as <lb/>
pleased as if he had been delivered of the <i>Ausgleich</i>. <lb/>
Indeed, he does look notably fine. He wears almost <lb/>
the only dress vest on the floor; it exposes a con- <lb/>
tinental spread of white shirt-front; his hands are <lb/>
posed at ease in the lips of his trousers pockets; his <lb/>
head is tilted back complacently; he is attitudinizing; <lb/>
he is playing to the gallery. However, they are all <lb/>
doing that. It is curious to see. Men who only <lb/>
vote, and can't make speeches, and don't know how <lb/>
to invent witty ejaculations, wander about the vacated <lb/>
parts of the floor, and stop in a good place and strike <lb/>
attitudes&#x2014;attitudes suggestive of weighty thought, <lb/>
mostly&#x2014;and glance furtively up at the galleries to <lb/>
see how it works; or a couple will come together <lb/>
and shake hands in an artificial way, and laugh a gay <lb/>
manufactured laugh, and do some constrained and <lb/>
self-conscious attitudinizing; and <i>they</i> steal glances <lb/>
at the galleries to see if they are getting notice. <lb/>
<pb n="238"/>
It is like a scene on the stage&#x2014;by-play by minor <lb/>
actors at the back while the stars do the great work <lb/>
at the front. Even Count Badeni attitudinizes for <lb/>
a moment; strikes a reflective Napoleonic attitude <lb/>
of fine picturesqueness&#x2014;but soon thinks better of <lb/>
it and desists. There are two who do not attitudin- <lb/>
ize&#x2014;poor harried and insulted President Abraham- <lb/>
owicz, who seems wholly miserable, and can find no <lb/>
way to put in the dreary time but by swinging his <lb/>
bell and by discharging occasional remarks which <lb/>
nobody can hear; and a resigned and patient priest, <lb/>
who sits lonely in a great vacancy on Majority <lb/>
territory and munches an apple.</p>
<p>Sch&#x00F6;nerer uplifts his fog-horn of a voice and <lb/>
shakes the roof with an insult discharged at the <lb/>
Majority.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Dr. Lueger</i>.</speaker><p>"The Honorless Party would better <lb/>

<sp><speaker><i>Prochazka</i> (to Sch&#x00F6;nerer).</speaker><p>"Drunken clown!"</p>
<p>During the final hour of the sitting many happy <lb/>
phrases were distributed through the proceedings. <lb/>
Among them were these&#x2014;and they are strikingly <lb/>
good ones:</p></sp>
<p>Blatherskite!</p>
<p>Blackguard!</p>
<p>Scoundrel!</p>
<p>Brothel-daddy!</p>
<pb n="239"/>
<p>This last was the contribution of Dr. Gessman, <lb/>
and gave great satisfaction. And deservedly. It <lb/>
seems to me that it was one of the most sparkling <lb/>
things that was said during the whole evening.</p>
<p>At half-past two in the morning the House ad- <lb/>
journed. The victory was with the Opposition. <lb/>
No; not quite that. The effective part of it was <lb/>
snatched away from them by an unlawful exercise <lb/>
of Presidential force&#x2014;another contribution toward <lb/>
driving the mistreated Minority out of their minds.</p>
<p>At other sittings of the parliament, gentlemen of <lb/>
the Opposition, shaking their fists toward the Presi- <lb/>
dent, addressed him as "Polish Dog." At one <lb/>
sitting an angry deputy turned upon a colleague <lb/>
and shouted,</p>
<p>"<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>!"</p>
<p>You must try to imagine what it was. If I should <lb/>
offer it even in the original it would probably not get <lb/>
by the Magazine editor's blue pencil; to offer a <lb/>
translation would be to waste my ink, of course. <lb/>
This remark was frankly printed in its entirety by <lb/>
one of the Vienna dailies, but the others disguised <lb/>
the toughest half of it with stars.</p>
<p>If the reader will go back over this chapter and <lb/>
gather its array of extraordinary epithets into a bunch <lb/>
and examine them, he will marvel at two things: <lb/>
how this convention of gentlemen could consent to <lb/>
use such gross terms; and why the users were <lb/>
allowed to get out of the place alive. There is no <lb/>
way to understand this strange situation. If every <lb/>
<pb n="240"/>
man in the House were a professional blackguard, <lb/>
and had his home in a sailor boarding-house, one <lb/>
could still not understand it; for although that sort <lb/>
do use such terms, they never <i>take</i> them. These men <lb/>
are not professional blackguards; they are mainly <lb/>
gentlemen, and educated; yet they use the terms, <lb/>
and take them, too. They really seem to attach no <lb/>
consequence to them. One cannot say that they act <lb/>
like schoolboys; for that is only almost true, not <lb/>
entirely. Schoolboys blackguard each other fiercely, <lb/>
and by the hour, and one would think that nothing <lb/>
would ever come of it but noise; but that would <lb/>
be a mistake. Up to a certain limit the result would <lb/>
be noise only, but that limit overstepped, trouble <lb/>
would follow right away. There are certain phrases <lb/>
&#x2014;phrases of a peculiar character&#x2014;phrases of the <lb/>
nature of that reference to Sch&#x00F6;nerer's grandmother, <lb/>
for instance, which not even the most spiritless school- <lb/>
boy in the English-speaking world would allow to <lb/>
pass unavenged. One difference between school- <lb/>
boys and the law-makers of the Reichsrath seems to <lb/>
be that the law-makers have no limit, no danger-line. <lb/>
Apparently they may call each other what they please, <lb/>
and go home unmutilated.</p>
<p>Now, in fact, they did have a scuffle on two <lb/>
occasions, but it was not on account of names <lb/>
called. There has been no scuffle where <i>that</i> was <lb/>
the cause.</p>
<p>It is not to be inferred that the House lacks a sense <lb/>
of honor because it lacks delicacy. That would be <lb/>
<pb n="241"/>
an error. Iro was caught in a lie, and it profoundly <lb/>
disgraced him. The House cut him, turned its back <lb/>
upon him. He resigned his seat; otherwise he would <lb/>
have been expelled. But it was lenient with Gregorig, <lb/>
who had called Iro a cowardly blatherskite in debate. <lb/>
It merely went through the form of mildly censuring <lb/>
him. That did not trouble Gregorig.</p>
<p>The Viennese say of themselves that they are an <lb/>
easy-going, pleasure-loving community, making the <lb/>
best of life, and not taking it very seriously. Never- <lb/>
theless, they are grieved about the ways of their parlia- <lb/>
ment, and say quite frankly that they are ashamed. <lb/>
They claim that the low condition of the parliament's <lb/>
manners is new, not old. A gentleman who was at <lb/>
the head of the government twenty years ago con- <lb/>
firms this, and says that in his time the parliament <lb/>
was orderly and well-behaved. An English gentle- <lb/>
man of long residence here endorses this, and says <lb/>
that a low order of politicians originated the present <lb/>
forms of questionable speech on the stump some <lb/>
years ago, and imported them into the parliament.<ref target="n13">*</ref><note id="n13" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>In that gracious bygone time when a mild and good-tempered <lb/>
spirit was the atmosphere of our House, when the manner of our speak- <lb/>
ers was studiously formal and academic, and the storms and explosions <lb/>
of to-day were wholly unknown," etc.&#x2014;<i>Translation of the opening <lb/>

<head><smcap>iv. the historic climax.</smcap></head>
<p>During the whole of November things went from <lb/>
bad to worse. The all-important <i>Ausgleich</i> remained <lb/>
hard aground, and could not be sparred off. Badeni's <lb/>
government could not withdraw the Language Ordi- <lb/>
nance and keep its majority, and the Opposition <lb/>
could not be placated on easier terms. One night, <lb/>
while the customary pandemonium was crashing <lb/>
and thundering along at its best, a fight broke out. <lb/>
It was a surging, struggling, shoulder-to-shoulder <lb/>
scramble. A great many blows were struck. Twice <lb/>
Sch&#x00F6;nerer lifted one of the heavy ministerial fauteuils <lb/>
&#x2014;some say with one hand&#x2014;and threatened members <lb/>
of the Majority with it, but it was wrenched away <lb/>
from him; a member hammered Wolf over the head <lb/>
with the President's bell, and another member choked <lb/>
him; a professor was flung down and belabored with <lb/>
fists and choked; he held up an open penknife as a <lb/>
defence against the blows; it was snatched from him <lb/>
and flung to a distance; it hit a peaceful Christian <lb/>
Socialist who wasn't doing anything, and brought <lb/>
blood from his hand. This was the only blood <lb/>
drawn. The men who got hammered and choked <lb/>
looked sound and well next day. The fists and the <lb/>
bell were not properly handled, or better results would <lb/>
have been apparent. I am quite sure that the fighters <lb/>
were not in earnest.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving day the sitting was a history- <lb/>
making one. On that day the harried, bedeviled, <lb/>
and despairing government went insane. In order <lb/>
<pb n="243"/>
to free itself from the thraldom of the Opposition it <lb/>
committed this curiously juvenile crime: it moved an <lb/>
important change of the Rules of the House, forbade <lb/>
debate upon the motion, put it to a stand-up vote <lb/>
instead of ayes and noes, and then gravely claimed <lb/>
that it had been adopted; whereas, to even the dullest <lb/>
witness&#x2014;if I without immodesty may pretend to <lb/>
that place&#x2014;it was plain that nothing legitimately <lb/>
to be called a vote had been taken at all.</p>
<p>I think that Saltpeter never uttered a truer thing <lb/>
than when he said, "Whom the gods would destroy <lb/>
they first make mad."</p>
<p>Evidently the government's mind was tottering <lb/>
when this bald insult to the House was the best way <lb/>
it could contrive for getting out of the frying-pan.</p>
<p>The episode would have been funny if the matter <lb/>
at stake had been a trifle; but in the circumstances <lb/>
it was pathetic. The usual storm was raging in the <lb/>
House. As usual, many of the Majority and the <lb/>
most of the Minority were standing up&#x2014;to have a <lb/>
better chance to exchange epithets and make other <lb/>
noises. Into this storm Count Falkenhayn entered, <lb/>
with his paper in his hand; and at once there was a <lb/>
rush to get near him and hear him read his motion. <lb/>
In a moment he was walled in by listeners. The <lb/>
several clauses of his motion were loudly applauded <lb/>
by these allies, and as loudly disapplauded&#x2014;if I <lb/>
may invent a word&#x2014;by such of the Opposition as <lb/>
could hear his voice. When he took his seat the <lb/>
President promptly put the motion&#x2014;persons desiring <lb/>
<pb n="244"/>
to vote in the affirmative, <i>stand up!</i> The House <lb/>
was already standing up; had been standing for an <lb/>
hour; and before a third of it had found out what <lb/>
the President had been saying, he had proclaimed <lb/>
the adoption of the motion! And only a few heard <lb/>
<i>that</i> In fact, when that House is legislating you <lb/>
can't tell it from artillery-practice.</p>
<p>You will realize what a happy idea it was to <lb/>
side-track the lawful ayes and noes and substitute <lb/>
a stand-up vote by this fact: that a little later, <lb/>
when a deputation of deputies waited upon the <lb/>
President and asked him if he was actually will- <lb/>
ing to claim that that measure had been passed, <lb/>
he answered, "Yes&#x2014;and <i>unanimously</i>." It shows <lb/>
that in effect the whole house was on its feet <lb/>
when that trick was sprung.</p>
<p>The "Lex Falkenhayn," thus strangely born, <lb/>
gave the President power to suspend for three days <lb/>
any deputy who should continue to be disorderly <lb/>
after being called to order twice, and it also placed <lb/>
at his disposal such force as might be necessary to <lb/>
make the suspension effective. So the House had a <lb/>
sergeant-at-arms at last, and a more formidable one, <lb/>
as to power, than any other legislature in Christen- <lb/>
dom had ever possessed. The Lex Falkenhayn also <lb/>
gave the House itself authority to suspend members <lb/>
for <i>thirty</i> days.</p>
<p>On these terms the <i>Ausgleich</i> could be put through <lb/>
in an hour&#x2014;apparently. The Opposition would <lb/>
have to sit meek and quiet, and stop obstructing, or <lb/>
<pb n="245"/>
be turned into the street, deputy after deputy, leaving <lb/>
the Majority an unvexed field for its work.</p>
<p>Certainly the thing looked well. The government <lb/>
was out of the frying-pan at last. It congratulated <lb/>
itself, and was almost girlishly happy. Its stock rose <lb/>
suddenly from less than nothing to a premium. It <lb/>
confessed to itself, with pride, that its Lex Falkenhayn <lb/>
was a master-stroke&#x2014;a work of genius.</p>
<p>However, there were doubters; men who were <lb/>
troubled, and believed that a grave mistake had been <lb/>
made. It might be that the Opposition was crushed, <lb/>
and profitably for the country, too; but the <i>manner</i> <lb/>
of it&#x2014;the <i>manner</i> of it! That was the serious part. <lb/>
It could have far-reaching results; results whose <lb/>
gravity might transcend all guessing. It might be <lb/>
the initial step toward a return to government by <lb/>
force, a restoration of the irresponsible methods of <lb/>
obsolete times.</p>
<p>There were no vacant seats in the galleries next <lb/>
day. In fact, standing-room outside the building <lb/>
was at a premium. There were crowds there, and a <lb/>
glittering array of helmeted and brass-buttoned <lb/>
police, on foot and on horseback, to keep them from <lb/>
getting too much excited. No one could guess what <lb/>
was going to happen, but every one felt that <i>some- <lb/>
thing</i> was going to happen, and hoped he might have <lb/>
a chance to see it, or at least get the news of it while <lb/>
it was fresh.</p>
<p>At noon the House was empty&#x2014;for I do not <lb/>
count myself. Half an hour later the two galleries <lb/>
<pb n="246"/>
were solidly packed, the floor still empty. Another <lb/>
half-hour later Wolf entered and passed to his place; <lb/>
then other deputies began to stream in, among them <lb/>
many forms and faces grown familiar of late. By <lb/>
one o'clock the membership was present in full force. <lb/>
A band of Socialists stood grouped against the <lb/>
ministerial desks, in the shadow of the Presidential <lb/>
tribune. It was observable that these official strong- <lb/>
holds were now protected against rushes by bolted <lb/>
gates, and that these were in ward of servants <lb/>
wearing the House's livery. Also the removable <lb/>
desk-boards had been taken away, and nothing left <lb/>
for disorderly members to slat with.</p>
<p>There was a pervading, anxious hush&#x2014;at least <lb/>
what stood very well for a hush in that house. It <lb/>
was believed by many that the Opposition was cowed, <lb/>
and that there would be no more obstruction, no <lb/>
more noise. That was an error.</p>
<p>Presently the President entered by the distant door <lb/>
to the right, followed by Vice-President Fuchs, and <lb/>
the two took their way down past the Polish benches <lb/>
toward the tribune. Instantly the customary storm <lb/>
of noises burst out, and rose higher and higher, and <lb/>
wilder and wilder, and really seemed to surpass any- <lb/>
thing that had gone before it in that place. The <lb/>
President took his seat, and begged for order, but no <lb/>
one could hear him. His lips moved&#x2014;one could <lb/>
see that; he bowed his body forward appealingly, <lb/>
and spread his great hand eloquently over his breast <lb/>
&#x2014;one could see that; but as concerned his uttered <lb/>
<pb n="247"/>
words, he probably could not hear them himself. <lb/>
Below him was that crowd of two dozen Socialists <lb/>
glaring up at him, shaking their fists at him, roaring <lb/>
imprecations and insulting epithets at him. This <lb/>
went on for some time. Suddenly the Socialists <lb/>
burst through the gates and stormed up through the <lb/>
ministerial benches, and a man in a red cravat reached <lb/>
up and snatched the documents that lay on the Presi- <lb/>
dent's desk and flung them abroad. The next <lb/>
moment he and his allies were struggling and fighting <lb/>
with the half-dozen uniformed servants who were <lb/>
there to protect the new gates. Meantime a detail <lb/>
of Socialists had swarmed up the side steps and over- <lb/>
flowed the President and the Vice, and were crowd- <lb/>
ing and shouldering and shoving them out of the <lb/>
place. They crowded them out, and down the steps <lb/>
and across the House, past the Polish benches; and <lb/>
all about them swarmed hostile Poles and Czechs, <lb/>
who resisted them. One could see fists go up and <lb/>
come down, with other signs and shows of a heady <lb/>
fight; then the President and the Vice disappeared <lb/>
through the door of entrance, and the victorious <lb/>
Socialists turned and marched back, mounted the <lb/>
tribune, flung the President's bell and his remaining <lb/>
papers abroad, and then stood there in a compact <lb/>
little crowd, eleven strong, and held the place as if it <lb/>
were a fortress. Their friends on the floor were in <lb/>
a frenzy of triumph, and manifested it in their <lb/>
deafening way. The whole House was on its feet, <lb/>
amazed and wondering.</p>
<pb n="248"/>
<p>It was an astonishing situation, and imposingly <lb/>
dramatic. Nobody had looked for this. The un- <lb/>
expected had happened. What next? But there <lb/>
<i>can</i> be no next; the play is over; the grand climax <lb/>
is reached; the possibilities are exhausted: ring <lb/>
down the curtain.</p>
<p>Not yet. That distant door opens again. And <lb/>
now we see what history will be talking of five <lb/>
centuries hence: a uniformed and helmeted battalion <lb/>
of bronzed and stalwart men marching in double file <lb/>
down the floor of the House&#x2014;a free parliament <lb/>
profaned by an invasion of brute force</p>
<p>It was an odious spectacle&#x2014;odious and awful. <lb/>
For one moment it was an unbelievable thing&#x2014;a <lb/>
thing beyond all credibility; it must be a delusion, a <lb/>
dream, a nightmare. But no, it was real&#x2014;pitifully <lb/>
real, shamefully real, hideously real. These sixty <lb/>
policemen had been soldiers, and they went at their <lb/>
work with the cold unsentimentality of their trade. <lb/>
They ascended the steps of the tribune, laid their <lb/>
hands upon the inviolable persons of the represent- <lb/>
atives of a nation, and dragged and tugged and <lb/>
hauled them down the steps and out at the door; then <lb/>
ranged themselves in stately military array in front <lb/>
of the ministerial <i>estrade</i>, and so stood.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous episode. The memory of it <lb/>
will outlast all the thrones that exist to-day. In the <lb/>
whole history of free parliaments the like of it had <lb/>
been seen but three times before. It takes its im- <lb/>
posing place among the world's unforgettable things <lb/>
<pb n="249"/>
I think that in my lifetime I have not twice seen <lb/>
abiding history made before my eyes, but I know <lb/>
that I have seen it once.</p>
<p>Some of the results of this wild freak followed <lb/>
instantly. The Badeni government came down with <lb/>
a crash; there was a popular outbreak or two in <lb/>
Vienna; there were three or four days of furious <lb/>
rioting in Prague, followed by the establishing there <lb/>
of martial law; the Jews and Germans were harried <lb/>
and plundered, and their houses destroyed; in other <lb/>
Bohemian towns there was rioting&#x2014;in some cases <lb/>
the Germans being the rioters, in others the Czechs <lb/>
&#x2014;and in all cases the Jew had to roast, no matter <lb/>
which side he was on. We are well along in <lb/>
December now;<ref target="n14">*</ref><note id="n14" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>It is the 9th.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> the new Minister-President has not <lb/>

in calling it together again for the present; public <lb/>
opinion believes that parliamentary government and <lb/>
the Constitution are actually threatened with ex- <lb/>
tinction, and that the permanency of the monarchy <lb/>
itself is a not absolutely certain thing!</p>
<p>Yes, the Lex Falkenhayn was a great invention, <lb/>

<head><b>CONCERNING THE JEWS</b></head>
<p><smcap>Some</smcap> months ago I published a magazine article <lb/>
descriptive of a remarkable scene in the <lb/>
Imperial Parliament in Vienna. Since then I have <lb/>
received from Jews in America several letters of in- <lb/>
quiry. They were difficult letters to answer, for <lb/>
they were not very definite. But at last I received a <lb/>
definite one. It is from a lawyer, and he really asks <lb/>
the questions which the other writers probably be- <lb/>
lieved they were asking. By help of this text I will <lb/>
do the best I can to publicly answer this cor- <lb/>
respondent, and also the others&#x2014;at the same time <lb/>
apologizing for having failed to reply privately. <lb/>
The lawyer's letter reads as follows: <lb/>
<q>I have read "Stirring Times in Austria." One point in particular <lb/>
is of vital import to not a few thousand people, including myself, being <lb/>
a point about which I have often wanted to address a question to some <lb/>
disinterested person. The show of military force in the Austrian Parlia- <lb/>
ment, which precipitated the riots, was not introduced by any Jew. No <lb/>
Jew was a member of that body. No Jewish question was involved in <lb/>
the Ausgleich or in the language proposition. No Jew was insulting <lb/>
anybody. In short, no Jew was doing any mischief toward anybody <lb/>
whatsoever. In fact, the Jews were the only ones of the nineteen dif- <lb/>
ferent races in Austria which did not have a party&#x2014;they are absolutely <lb/>
non-participants. Yet in your article you say that in the rioting which <lb/>
followed, all classes of people were unanimous only on one thing, viz., <lb/>
<pb n="251"/>
in being against the Jews. Now will you kindly tell me why, in your <lb/>
judgment, the Jews have thus ever been, and are even now, in these <lb/>
days of supposed intelligence, the butt of baseless, vicious animosities? <lb/>
I dare say that for centuries there has been no more quiet, undisturbing, <lb/>
and well-behaving citizens, as a class, than that same Jew. It seems to <lb/>
me that ignorance and fanaticism cannot alone account for these horri- <lb/>
ble and unjust persecutions.</q>
<q>Tell me, therefore, from your vantage-point of cold view, what in <lb/>
your mind is the cause. Can American Jews do anything to correct it <lb/>
either in America or abroad? Will it ever come to an end? Will a <lb/>
Jew be permitted to live honestly, decently, and peaceably like the rest <lb/>
of mankind? What has become of the golden rule?</q></p>
<p>I will begin by saying that if I thought myself <lb/>
prejudiced against the Jew, I should hold it fairest <lb/>
to leave this subject to a person not crippled in that <lb/>
way. But I think I have no such prejudice. A few <lb/>
years ago a Jew observed to me that there was no <lb/>
uncourteous reference to his people in my books, <lb/>
and asked how it happened. It happened because <lb/>
the disposition was lacking. I am quite sure that <lb/>
(bar one) I have no race prejudices, and I think I <lb/>
have no color prejudices nor caste prejudices nor <lb/>
creed prejudices. Indeed, I know it. I can stand <lb/>
any society. All that I care to know is that a man <lb/>
is a human being&#x2014;that is enough for me; he can't <lb/>
be any worse. I have no special regard for Satan; <lb/>
but I can at least claim that I have no prejudice <lb/>
against him. It may even be that I lean a little his <lb/>
way, on account of his not having a fair show. All <lb/>
religions issue bibles against him, and say the most <lb/>
injurious things about him, but we never hear <i>his</i> <lb/>
side. We have none but the evidence for the prose- <lb/>
<pb n="252"/>
cution, and yet we have rendered the verdict. To <lb/>
my mind, this is irregular. It is un-English; it is <lb/>
un-American; it is French. Without this pre- <lb/>
cedent Dreyfus could not have been condemned. <lb/>
Of course Satan has some kind of a case, it goes <lb/>
without saying. It may be a poor one, but that is <lb/>
nothing; that can be said about any of us. As soon <lb/>
as I can get at the facts I will undertake his re- <lb/>
habilitation myself, if I can find an unpolitic pub- <lb/>
lisher. It is a thing which we ought to be willing to <lb/>
do for any one who is under a cloud. We may not <lb/>
pay him reverence, for that would be indiscreet, but <lb/>
we can at least respect his talents. A person who <lb/>
has for untold centuries maintained the imposing <lb/>
position of spiritual head of four-fifths of the human <lb/>
race, and political head of the whole of it, must be <lb/>
granted the possession of executive abilities of the <lb/>
loftiest order. In his large presence the other popes <lb/>
and politicians shrink to midges for the microscope. <lb/>
I would like to see him. I would rather see him <lb/>
and shake him by the tail than any other member of <lb/>
the European Concert. In the present paper I shall <lb/>
allow myself to use the word Jew as if it stood for <lb/>
both religion and race. It is handy; and besides, <lb/>
that is what the term means to the general world.</p>
<p>In the above letter one notes these points:</p>
<list>
<item>1. The Jew is a well-behaved citizen.</item>
<item>2. Can ignorance and fanaticism <i>alone</i> account <lb/>
for his unjust treatment?</item>
<item>3. Can Jews do anything to improve the situation?</item>
<pb n="253"/>
<item>4. The Jews have no party; they are non- <lb/>
participants.</item>
<item>5. Will the persecution ever come to an end?</item>
<item>6. What has become of the golden rule?</item>
</list>
<p><i>Point No. 1</i>.&#x2014;We must grant proposition No. 1, <lb/>
for several sufficient reasons. The Jew is not a dis- <lb/>
turber of the peace of any country. Even his <lb/>
enemies will concede that. He is not a loafer, he is <lb/>
not a sot, he is not noisy, he is not a brawler nor a <lb/>
rioter, he is not quarrelsome. In the statistics of <lb/>
crime his presence is conspicuously rare&#x2014;in all <lb/>
countries. With murder and other crimes of <lb/>
violence he has but little to do: he is a stranger to <lb/>
the hangman. In the police court's daily long roll <lb/>
of "assaults" and "drunk and disorderlies" his <lb/>
name seldom appears. That the Jewish home is a <lb/>
home in the truest sense is a fact which no one will <lb/>
dispute. The family is knitted together by the <lb/>
strongest affections; its members show each other <lb/>
every due respect; and reverence for the elders is <lb/>
an inviolate law of the house. The Jew is not a <lb/>
burden on the charities of the state nor of the city; <lb/>
these could cease from their functions without <lb/>
affecting him. When he is well enough, he works; <lb/>
when he is incapacitated, his own people take care <lb/>
of him. And not in a poor and stingy way, but <lb/>
with a fine and large benevolence. His race is en- <lb/>
titled to be called the most benevolent of all the <lb/>
races of men. A Jewish beggar is not impossible, <lb/>
perhaps; such a thing may exist, but there are few <lb/>
<pb n="254"/>
men that can say they have seen that spectacle. The <lb/>
Jew has been staged in many uncomplimentary <lb/>
forms, but, so far as I know, no dramatist has done <lb/>
him the injustice to stage him as a beggar. When- <lb/>
ever a Jew has real need to beg, his people save him <lb/>
from the necessity of doing it. The charitable in- <lb/>
stitutions of the Jews are supported by Jewish <lb/>
money, and amply. The Jews make no noise about <lb/>
it; it is done quietly; they do not nag and pester <lb/>
and harass us for contributions; they give us peace, <lb/>
and set us an example&#x2014;an example which we have <lb/>
not found ourselves able to follow; for by nature we <lb/>
are not free givers, and have to be patiently and <lb/>
persistently hunted down in the interest of the un- <lb/>
fortunate.</p>
<p>These facts are all on the credit side of the prop- <lb/>
osition that the Jew is a good and orderly citizen. <lb/>
Summed up, they certify that he is quiet, peaceable, <lb/>
industrious, unaddicted to high crimes and brutal <lb/>
dispositions; that his family life is commendable; <lb/>
that he is not a burden upon public charities; that <lb/>
he is not a beggar; that in benevolence he is above <lb/>
the reach of competition. These are the very <lb/>
quintessentials of good citizenship. If you can add <lb/>
that he is as honest as the average of his neighbors <lb/>
&#x2014; But I think that question is affirmatively <lb/>
answered by the fact that he is a successful business <lb/>
man. The basis of successful business is honesty; <lb/>
a business cannot thrive where the parties to it <lb/>
cannot trust each other. In the matter of numbers <lb/>
<pb n="255"/>
the Jew counts for little in the overwhelming <lb/>
population of New York; but that his honesty <lb/>
counts for much is guaranteed by the fact that the <lb/>
immense wholesale business of Broadway, from the <lb/>
Battery to Union Square, is substantially in his <lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>I suppose that the most picturesque example in <lb/>
history of a trader's trust in his fellow-trader was <lb/>
one where it was not Christian trusting Christian, but <lb/>
Christian trusting Jew. That Hessian Duke who <lb/>
used to sell his subjects to George III. to fight <lb/>
George Washington with got rich at it; and by-and- <lb/>
by, when the wars engendered by the French <lb/>
Revolution made his throne too warm for him, he <lb/>
was obliged to fly the country. He was in a hurry, <lb/>
and had to leave his earnings behind&#x2014;&#x0024;9,000,000. <lb/>
He had to risk the money with some one without <lb/>
security. He did not select a Christian, but a Jew <lb/>
&#x2014;a Jew of only modest means, but of high <lb/>
character; a character so high that it left him lone- <lb/>
some&#x2014;Rothschild of Frankfort. Thirty years later, <lb/>
when Europe had become quiet and safe again, the <lb/>
Duke came back from overseas, and the Jew re- <lb/>
turned the loan, with interest added.<ref target="n15">*</ref><note id="n15" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Here is another piece of picturesque history; and it reminds us <lb/>
that shabbiness and dishonesty are not the monopoly of any race or <lb/>
creed, but are merely human:</p>
<p>"Congress passed a bill to pay &#x0024;379.56 to Moses Pendergrass, of Lib- <lb/>
ertyville, Missouri. The story of the reason of this liberality is patheti- <lb/>
cally interesting, and shows the sort of pickle that an honest man may <lb/>
get into who undertakes to do an honest job of work for Uncle Sam. <lb/>
In 1886 Moses Pendergrass put in a bid for the contract to carry the <lb/>
mail on the route from Knob Lick to Libertyville and Coffman, thirty <lb/>
miles a day, from July 1, 1887, for one year. He got the postmaster at <lb/>
Knob Lick to write the letter for him, and while Moses intended that <lb/>
his bid should be &#x0024;400, his scribe carelessly made it &#x0024;4. Moses got the <lb/>
contract, and did not find out about the mistake until the end of the <lb/>
first quarter, when he got his first pay. When he found at what rate he <lb/>
was working he was sorely cast down, and opened communication with <lb/>
the Post Office Department. The department informed him that he <lb/>
must either carry out his contract or throw it up, and that if he threw it up <lb/>
his bondsmen would have to pay the government &#x0024;1,459.85 damages. <lb/>
So Moses carried out his contract, walked thirty miles every week-day <lb/>
for a year, and carried the mail, and received for his labor &#x0024;4&#x2014;or, to <lb/>
be accurate, &#x0024;6.84; for, the route being extended after his bid was <lb/>
accepted, the pay was proportionately increased. Now, after ten years, <lb/>
a bill was finally passed to pay to Moses the difference between what he <lb/>
earned in that unlucky year and what he received."</p>
<p>The <i>Sun</i>, which tells the above story, says that bills were introduced <lb/>
in three or four Congresses for Moses's relief, and that committees re- <lb/>
peatedly investigated his claim.</p>
<p>It took six Congresses, containing in their persons the compressed <lb/>
virtues of 70,000,000 of people, and cautiously and carefully giving ex- <lb/>
pression to those virtues in the fear of God and the next election, eleven <lb/>
years to find out some way to cheat a fellow-Christian out of about &#x0024;13 <lb/>
on his honestly executed contract, and out of nearly &#x0024;300 due him on <lb/>
its enlarged terms. And they succeeded. During the same time they <lb/>
paid out &#x0024;1,000,000,000 in pensions&#x2014;a third of it unearned and unde- <lb/>
served. This indicates a splendid all-around competency in theft, for it <lb/>
starts with farthings, and works its industries all the way up to ship- <lb/>
loads. It may be possible that the Jews can beat this, but the man that <lb/>
bets on it is taking chances.</p></note></p>
<pb n="256"/>
<p>The Jew has his other side. He has some dis- <lb/>
creditable ways, though he has not a monopoly of <lb/>
them, because he cannot get entirely rid of vexatious <lb/>
Christian competition. We have seen that he seldom <lb/>
transgresses the laws against crimes of violence. <lb/>
<pb n="257"/>
Indeed, his dealings with courts are almost restricted <lb/>
to matters connected with commerce. He has a <lb/>
reputation for various small forms of cheating, and <lb/>
for practicing oppressive usury, and for burning <lb/>
himself out to get the insurance, and arranging for <lb/>
cunning contracts which leave him an exit but lock <lb/>
the other man in, and for smart evasions which find <lb/>
him safe and comfortable just within the strict letter <lb/>
of the law, when court and jury know very well that <lb/>
he has violated the spirit of it. He is a frequent and <lb/>
faithful and capable officer in the civil service, but he <lb/>
is charged with an unpatriotic disinclination to stand <lb/>
by the flag as a soldier&#x2014;like the Christian Quaker.</p>
<p>Now if you offset these discreditable features by <lb/>
the creditable ones summarized in a preceding para- <lb/>
graph beginning with the words, "These facts are all <lb/>
on the credit side," and strike a balance, what must <lb/>
the verdict be? This, I think: that, the merits and <lb/>
demerits being fairly weighed and measured on both <lb/>
sides, the Christian can claim no superiority over the <lb/>
Jew in the matter of good citizenship.</p>
<p>Yet, in all countries, from the dawn of history, <lb/>
the Jew has been persistently and implacably hated, <lb/>
and with frequency persecuted.</p>
<p><i>Point No. 2</i>.&#x2014;"Can fanaticism <i>alone</i> account for <lb/>
this?"</p>
<p>Years ago I used to think that it was responsible <lb/>
for nearly all of it, but latterly I have come to think <lb/>
that this was an error. Indeed, it is now my con- <lb/>
viction that it is responsible for hardly any of it.</p>
<pb n="258"/>
<p>In this connection I call to mind Genesis, chapter <lb/>
xlvii.</p>
<p>We have all thoughtfully&#x2014;or unthoughtfully&#x2014; <lb/>
read the pathetic story of the years of plenty and <lb/>
the years of famine in Egypt, and how Joseph, with <lb/>
that opportunity, made a corner in broken hearts, <lb/>
and the crusts of the poor, and human liberty&#x2014;a <lb/>
corner whereby he took a nation's money all away, <lb/>
to the last penny; took a nation's live-stock all <lb/>
away, to the last hoof; took a nation's land away, <lb/>
to the last acre; then took the nation itself, buying <lb/>
it for bread, man by man, woman by woman, child <lb/>
by child, till all were slaves; a corner which took <lb/>
everything, left nothing; a corner so stupendous <lb/>
that, by comparison with it, the most gigantic <lb/>
corners in subsequent history are but baby things, <lb/>
for it dealt in hundreds of millions of bushels, and <lb/>
its profits were reckonable by hundreds of millions <lb/>
of dollars, and it was a disaster so crushing that its <lb/>
effects have not wholly disappeared from Egypt to- <lb/>
day, more than three thousand years after the event.</p>
<p>Is it presumable that the eye of Egypt was upon <lb/>
Joseph, the foreign Jew, all this time? I think it <lb/>
likely. Was it friendly? We must doubt it. Was <lb/>
Joseph establishing a character for his race which <lb/>
would survive long in Egypt? And in time would <lb/>
his name come to be familiarly used to express that <lb/>
character&#x2014;like Shylock's? It is hardly to be <lb/>
doubted. Let us remember that this was <i>centuries <lb/>
before the crucifixion</i>.</p>
<pb n="259"/>
<p>I wish to come down eighteen hundred years later <lb/>
and refer to a remark made by one of the Latin <lb/>
historians. I read it in a translation many years <lb/>
ago, and it comes back to me now with force. It <lb/>
was alluding to a time when people were still living <lb/>
who could have seen the Saviour in the flesh. <lb/>
Christianity was so new that the people of Rome <lb/>
had hardly heard of it, and had but confused notions <lb/>
of what it was. The substance of the remark was <lb/>
this: Some Christians were persecuted in Rome <lb/>
through error, they being "<i>mistaken for Jews</i>."</p>
<p>The meaning seems plain. These pagans had <lb/>
nothing against Christians, but they were quite ready <lb/>
to persecute Jews. For some reason or other they <lb/>
hated a Jew before they even knew what a Christian <lb/>
was. May I not assume, then, that the persecution <lb/>
of Jews is a thing which <i>antedates</i> Christianity and <lb/>
was not born of Christianity? I think so. What <lb/>
was the origin of the feeling?</p>
<p>When I was a boy, in the back settlements of the <lb/>
Mississippi Valley, where a gracious and beautiful <lb/>
Sunday-school simplicity and unpracticality pre- <lb/>
vailed, the "Yankee" (citizen of the New England <lb/>
States) was hated with a splendid energy. But re- <lb/>
ligion had nothing to do with it. In a trade, the <lb/>
Yankee was held to be about five times the match <lb/>
of the Westerner. His shrewdness, his insight, <lb/>
his judgment, his knowledge, his enterprise, and his <lb/>
formidable cleverness in applying these forces were <lb/>
frankly confessed, and most competently cursed.</p>
<pb n="260"/>
<p>In the cotton States, after the war, the simple and <lb/>
ignorant negroes made the crops for the white <lb/>
planter on shares. The Jew came down in force, set <lb/>
up shop on the plantation, supplied all the negro's <lb/>
wants on credit, and at the end of the season was <lb/>
proprietor of the negro's share of the present crop <lb/>
and of part of his share of the next one. Before <lb/>
long, the whites detested the Jew, and it is doubtful <lb/>
if the negro loved him.</p>
<p>The Jew is being legislated out of Russia. The <lb/>
reason is not concealed. The movement was in- <lb/>
stituted because the Christian peasant and villager <lb/>
stood no chance against his commercial abilities. <lb/>
He was always ready to lend money on a crop, and <lb/>
sell vodka and other necessaries of life on credit <lb/>
while the crop was growing. When settlement day <lb/>
came he owned the crop; and next year or year <lb/>
after he owned the farm, like Joseph.</p>
<p>In the dull and ignorant England of John's time <lb/>
everybody got into debt to the Jew. He gathered <lb/>
all lucrative enterprises into his hands; he was the <lb/>
king of commerce; he was ready to be helpful in all <lb/>
profitable ways; he even financed crusades for the <lb/>
rescue of the Sepulchre. To wipe out his account <lb/>
with the nation and restore business to its natural <lb/>
and incompetent channels he had to be banished the <lb/>
realm.</p>
<p>For the like reasons Spain had to banish him <lb/>
four hundred years ago, and Austria about a couple <lb/>
of centuries later.</p>
<pb n="261"/>
<p>In all the ages Christian Europe has been obliged <lb/>
to curtail his activities. If he entered upon a <lb/>
mechanical trade, the Christian had to retire from it. <lb/>
If he set up as a doctor, he was the best one, and <lb/>
he took the business. If he exploited agriculture, <lb/>
the other farmers had to get at something else. <lb/>
Since there was no way to successfully compete <lb/>
with him in any vocation, the law had to step in <lb/>
and save the Christian from the poorhouse. Trade <lb/>
after trade was taken away from the Jew by statute <lb/>
till practically none was left. He was forbidden to <lb/>
engage in agriculture; he was forbidden to practice <lb/>
law; he was forbidden to practice medicine, except <lb/>
among Jews; he was forbidden the handicrafts. <lb/>
Even the seats of learning and the schools of science <lb/>
had to be closed against this tremendous antagonist. <lb/>
Still, almost bereft of employments, he found ways <lb/>
to make money, even ways to get rich. Also ways <lb/>
to invest his takings well, for usury was not denied <lb/>
him. In the hard conditions suggested, the Jew <lb/>
without brains could not survive, and the Jew with <lb/>
brains had to keep them in good training and well <lb/>
sharpened up, or starve. Ages of restriction to the <lb/>
one tool which the law was not able to take from <lb/>
him&#x2014;his brain&#x2014;have made that tool singularly <lb/>
competent; ages of compulsory disuse of his hands <lb/>
have atrophied them, and he never uses them now. <lb/>
This history has a very, very commercial look, a <lb/>
most sordid and practical commercial look, the busi- <lb/>
ness aspect of a Chinese cheap-labor crusade. <lb/>
<pb n="262"/>
Religious prejudices may account for one part of it, <lb/>
but not for the other nine.</p>
<p>Protestants have persecuted Catholics, but they <lb/>
did not take their livelihoods away from them. The <lb/>
Catholics have persecuted the Protestants with <lb/>
bloody and awful bitterness, but they never closed <lb/>
agriculture and the handicrafts against them. Why <lb/>
was that? That has the candid look of genuine <lb/>
religious persecution, not a trade-union boycott in a <lb/>
religious disguise.</p>
<p>The Jews are harried and obstructed in Austria <lb/>
and Germany, and lately in France; but England <lb/>
and America give them an open field and yet <lb/>
survive. Scotland offers them an unembarrassed <lb/>
field too, but there are not many takers. There are <lb/>
a few Jews in Glasgow, and one in Aberdeen; but <lb/>
that is because they can't earn enough to get away. <lb/>
The Scotch pay themselves that compliment, but it <lb/>
is authentic.</p>
<p>I feel convinced that the Crucifixion has not much <lb/>
to do with the world's attitude toward the Jew; that <lb/>
the reasons for it are older than that event, as sug- <lb/>
gested by Egypt's experience and by Rome's regret <lb/>
for having persecuted an unknown quantity called a <lb/>
Christian, under the mistaken impression that she <lb/>
was merely persecuting a Jew. <i>Merely</i> a Jew&#x2014;a <lb/>
skinned eel who was used to it, presumably. I am <lb/>
persuaded that in Russia, Austria, and Germany <lb/>
nine-tenths of the hostility to the Jew comes from <lb/>
the average Christian's inability to compete success- <lb/>
<pb n="263"/>
fully with the average Jew in business&#x2014;in either <lb/>
straight business or the questionable sort.</p>
<p>In Berlin, a few years ago, I read a speech which <lb/>
frankly urged the expulsion of the Jews from <lb/>
Germany; and the agitator's <i>reason</i> was as frank as <lb/>
his proposition. It was this: <i>that eighty-five per <lb/>
cent</i>. of the successful lawyers of Berlin were Jews, <lb/>
and that about the same percentage of the great and <lb/>
lucrative businesses of all sorts in Germany were in <lb/>
the hands of the Jewish race! Isn't it an amazing <lb/>
confession? It was but another way of saying that <lb/>
in a population of 48,000,000, of whom only 500,- <lb/>
000 were registered as Jews, eighty-five per cent. of <lb/>
the brains and honesty of the whole was lodged in <lb/>
the Jews. I must insist upon the honesty&#x2014;it is an <lb/>
essential of successful business, taken by and large. <lb/>
Of course it does not rule out rascals entirely, even <lb/>
among Christians, but it is a good working rule, <lb/>
nevertheless. The speaker's figures may have been <lb/>
inexact, but <i>the motive of persecution</i> stands out as <lb/>
clear as day.</p>
<p>The man claimed that in Berlin the banks, the <lb/>
newspapers, the theaters, the great mercantile, <lb/>
shipping, mining, and manufacturing interests, the <lb/>
big army and city contracts, the tramways, and <lb/>
pretty much all other properties of high value, and <lb/>
<i>also</i> the small businesses&#x2014;were in the hands of <lb/>
the Jews. He said the Jew was pushing the Christian <lb/>
to the wall all along the line; that it was all a <lb/>
Christian could do to scrape together a living; and <lb/>
<pb n="264"/>
that the Jew <i>must</i> be banished, and soon&#x2014;there was <lb/>
no other way of saving the Christian. Here in <lb/>
Vienna, last autumn, an agitator said that all these <lb/>
disastrous details were true of Austria-Hungary <lb/>
also; and in fierce language he demanded the ex- <lb/>
pulsion of the Jews. When politicians come out <lb/>
without a blush and read the baby act in this frank <lb/>
way, <i>unrebuked</i>, it is a very good indication that <lb/>
they have a market back of them, and know where <lb/>
to fish for votes.</p>
<p>You note the crucial point of the mentioned <lb/>
agitation; the argument is that the Christian cannot <lb/>
<i>compete</i> with the Jew, and that hence his very bread <lb/>
is in peril. To human beings this is a much more <lb/>
hate-inspiring thing than is any detail connected <lb/>
with religion. With most people, of a necessity, <lb/>
bread and meat take first rank, religion second. I <lb/>
am convinced that the persecution of the Jew is not <lb/>
due in any large degree to religious prejudice.</p>
<p>No, the Jew is a money-getter; and in getting his <lb/>
money he is a very serious obstruction to less <lb/>
capable neighbors who are on the same quest. I <lb/>
think that that is the trouble. In estimating worldly <lb/>
values the Jew is not shallow, but deep. With <lb/>
precocious wisdom he found out in the morning of <lb/>
time that some men worship rank, some worship <lb/>
heroes, some worship power, some worship God, <lb/>
and that over these ideals they dispute and cannot <lb/>
unite&#x2014;but that they all worship money; so he <lb/>
made it the end and aim of his life to get it. He <lb/>
<pb n="265"/>
was at it in Egypt thirty-six centuries ago; he was <lb/>
at it in Rome when that Christian got persecuted by <lb/>
mistake for him; he has been at it ever since. The <lb/>
cost to him has been heavy; his success has made <lb/>
the whole human race his enemy&#x2014;but it has paid, <lb/>
for it has brought him envy, and that is the only <lb/>
thing which men will sell both soul and body to get. <lb/>
He long ago observed that a millionaire commands <lb/>
respect, a two-millionaire homage, a multi-millionaire <lb/>
the deepest deeps of adoration. We all know that <lb/>
feeling; we have seen it express itself. We have <lb/>
noticed that when the average man mentions the <lb/>
name of a multi-millionaire he does it with that <lb/>
mixture in his voice of awe and reverence and lust <lb/>
which burns in a Frenchman's eye when it falls on <lb/>
another man's centime.</p>
<p><i>Point No. 4</i>.&#x2014;"The Jews have no party; they <lb/>
are non-participants."</p>
<p>Perhaps you have let the secret out and given <lb/>
yourself away. It seems hardly a credit to the race <lb/>
that it is able to say that; or to you, sir, that you <lb/>
can say it without remorse; more, that you should <lb/>
offer it as a plea against maltreatment, injustice, and <lb/>
oppression. Who gives the Jew the right, who <lb/>
gives any race the right, to sit still, in a free <lb/>
country, and let somebody else look after its safety? <lb/>
The oppressed Jew was entitled to all pity in the <lb/>
former times under brutal autocracies, for he was <lb/>
weak and friendless, and had no way to help his <lb/>
case. But he has ways now, and he has had them <lb/>
<pb n="266"/>
for a century, but I do not see that he has tried to <lb/>
make serious use of them. When the Revolution <lb/>
set him free in France it was an act of grace&#x2014;the <lb/>
grace of other people; he does not appear in it as <lb/>
a helper. I do not know that he helped when Eng- <lb/>
land set him free. Among the Twelve Sane Men of <lb/>
France who have stepped forward with great Zola at <lb/>
their head to fight (and win, I hope and believe<ref target="n16">*</ref><note id="n16" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The article was written in the summer of 1898.&#x2014;<smcap>Ed</smcap>.</p></note>) <lb/>
the battle for the most infamously misused Jew of <lb/>
modern times, do you find a great or rich or <lb/>
illustrious Jew helping? In the United States he <lb/>
was created free in the beginning&#x2014;he did not need <lb/>
to help, of course. In Austria, and Germany, and <lb/>
France he has a vote, but of what considerable use <lb/>
is it to him? He doesn't seem to know how to <lb/>
apply it to the best effect. With all his splendid <lb/>
capacities and all his fat wealth he is to-day not <lb/>
politically important in any country. In America, <lb/>
as early as 1854, the ignorant Irish hod-carrier, who <lb/>
had a spirit of his own and a way of exposing it to <lb/>
the weather, made it apparent to all that he must be <lb/>
politically reckoned with; yet fifteen years before <lb/>
that we hardly knew what an Irishman looked like. <lb/>
As an intelligent force, and numerically, he has <lb/>
always been away down, but he has governed the <lb/>
country just the same. It was because he was <lb/>
<i>organized</i>. It made his vote valuable&#x2014;in fact, <lb/>
essential.</p>
<p>You will say the Jew is everywhere numerically <lb/>
<pb n="267"/>
feeble. That is nothing to the point&#x2014;with the <lb/>
Irishman's history for an object-lesson. But I am <lb/>
coming to your numerical feebleness presently. In <lb/>
all parliamentary countries you could no doubt elect <lb/>
Jews to the legislatures&#x2014;and even <i>one</i> member in <lb/>
such a body is sometimes a force which counts. <lb/>
How deeply have you concerned yourselves about <lb/>
this in Austria, France, and Germany? Or even in <lb/>
America for that matter? You remark that the Jews <lb/>
were not to blame for the riots in this Reichsrath <lb/>
here, and you add with satisfaction that there wasn't <lb/>
one in that body. That is not strictly correct; if it <lb/>
were, would it not be in order for you to explain it <lb/>
and apologize for it, not try to make a merit of it? <lb/>
But I think that the Jew was by no means in as large <lb/>
force there as he ought to have been, with his <lb/>
chances. Austria opens the suffrage to him on fairly <lb/>
liberal terms, and it must surely be his own fault <lb/>
that he is so much in the background politically.</p>
<p>As to your numerical weakness. I mentioned <lb/>
some figures awhile ago&#x2014;500,000&#x2014;as the Jewish <lb/>
population of Germany. I will add some more&#x2014; <lb/>
6,000,000 in Russia, 5,000,000 in Austria, 250,000 <lb/>
in the United States. I take them from memory; I <lb/>
read them in the Encyclop&#x00E6;dia Britannica about ten <lb/>
years ago. Still, I am entirely sure of them. If <lb/>
those statistics are correct, my argument is not as <lb/>
strong as it ought to be as concerns America, but it <lb/>
still has strength. It is plenty strong enough as <lb/>
concerns Austria, for ten years ago 5,000,000 was <lb/>
<pb n="268"/>
nine per cent. of the empire's population. The <lb/>
Irish would govern the Kingdom of Heaven if they <lb/>
had a strength there like that.</p>
<p>I have some suspicions; I got them at second <lb/>
hand, but they have remained with me these ten or <lb/>
twelve years. When I read in the E. B. that the <lb/>
Jewish population of the United States was 250,000, <lb/>
I wrote the editor, and explained to him that I was <lb/>
personally acquainted with more Jews than that in <lb/>
my country, and that his figures were without doubt <lb/>
a misprint for 25,000,000. I also added that I was <lb/>
personally acquainted with <i>that</i> many there; but <lb/>
that was only to raise his confidence in me, for it <lb/>
was not true. His answer miscarried, and I never <lb/>
got it; but I went around talking about the matter, <lb/>
and people told me they had reason to suspect that <lb/>
for business reasons many Jews whose dealings were <lb/>
mainly with the Christians did not report themselves <lb/>
as Jews in the census. It looked plausible; it looks <lb/>
plausible yet. Look at the city of New York; and <lb/>
look at Boston, and Philadelphia, and New Orleans, <lb/>
and Chicago, and Cincinnati, and San Francisco&#x2014; <lb/>
how your race swarms in those places!&#x2014;and <lb/>
everywhere else in America, down to the least little <lb/>
village. Read the signs on the marts of commerce <lb/>
and on the shops: Goldstein (gold stone), Edelstein <lb/>
(precious stone), Blumenthal (flower-vale), Rosen- <lb/>
thal (rose-vale), Veilchenduft (violet odor), Sing- <lb/>
vogel (song-bird), Rosenzweig (rose branch), and <lb/>
all the amazing list of beautiful and enviable names <lb/>
<pb n="269"/>
which Prussia and Austria glorified you with so long <lb/>
ago. It is another instance of Europe's coarse and <lb/>
cruel persecution of your race; not that it was <lb/>
coarse and cruel to outfit it with pretty and poetical <lb/>
names like those, but that it was coarse and cruel to <lb/>
make it <i>pay</i> for them or else take such hideous and <lb/>
often indecent names that to-day their owners never <lb/>
use them; or, if they do, only on official papers. <lb/>
And it was the many, not the few, who got the <lb/>
odious names, they being too poor to bribe the <lb/>
officials to grant them better ones.</p>
<p>Now why was the race renamed? I have been told <lb/>
that in Prussia it was given to using fictitious names, <lb/>
and often changing them, so as to beat the tax- <lb/>
gatherer, escape military service, and so on; and <lb/>
that finally the idea was hit upon of furnishing all <lb/>
the inmates of a house with <i>one and the same sur- <lb/>
name</i>, and then holding the house responsible right <lb/>
along for those inmates, and accountable for any <lb/>
disappearances that might occur; it made the Jews <lb/>
keep track of <i>each other</i>, for self-interest's sake, and <lb/>
saved the government the trouble.<ref target="n17">*</ref><note id="n17" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>In Austria the renaming was merely done because the Jews in <lb/>
some newly acquired regions had no surnames, but were mostly named <lb/>
Abraham and Moses, and therefore the tax-gatherer could not tell <lb/>
t'other from which, and was likely to lose his reason over the matter. <lb/>
The renaming was put into the hands of the War Department, and a <lb/>
charming mess the graceless young lieutenants made of it. To them a <lb/>
Jew was of no sort of consequence, and they labeled the race in a way <lb/>
to make the angels weep. As an example take these two! <i>Abraham <lb/>
Bellyache</i> and <i>Schmul Godbedamned.&#x2014;Culled from "Namens Stu- <lb/>
dien," by Karl Emil Franzos</i>.</p></note></p>
<pb n="270"/>
<p>If that explanation of how the Jews of Prussia <lb/>
came to be renamed is correct, if it is true that they <lb/>
fictitiously registered themselves to gain certain ad- <lb/>
vantages, it may possibly be true that in America <lb/>
they refrain from registering themselves as Jews to <lb/>
fend off the damaging prejudices of the Christian <lb/>
customer. I have no way of knowing whether this <lb/>
notion is well founded or not. There may be other <lb/>
and better ways of explaining why only that poor <lb/>
little 250,000 of our Jews got into the Encyclop&#x00E6;dia. <lb/>
I may, of course, be mistaken, but I am strongly <lb/>
of the opinion that we have an immense Jewish <lb/>
population in America.</p>
<p><i>Point No. 3</i>.&#x2014;"Can Jews do anything to im- <lb/>
prove the situation?"</p>
<p>I think so. If I may make a suggestion without <lb/>
seeming to be trying to teach my grandmother how <lb/>
to suck eggs, I will offer it. In our days we have <lb/>
learned the value of combination. We apply it <lb/>
everywhere&#x2014;in railway systems, in trusts, in trade <lb/>
unions, in Salvation Armies, in minor politics, in <lb/>
major politics, in European Concerts. Whatever <lb/>
our strength may be, big or little, we <i>organize</i> it. <lb/>
We have found out that that is the only way to get <lb/>
the most out of it that is in it. We know the weak- <lb/>
ness of individual sticks, and the strength of the <lb/>
concentrated fagot. Suppose you try a scheme like <lb/>
this, for instance. In England and America put <lb/>
every Jew on the census-book <i>as</i> a Jew (in case you <lb/>
have not been doing that). Get up volunteer <lb/>
<pb n="271"/>
regiments composed of Jews solely, and, when the <lb/>
drum beats, fall in and go to the front, so as to re- <lb/>
move the reproach that you have few Mass&#x00E9;nas <lb/>
among you, and that you feed on a country but <lb/>
don't like to fight for it. Next, in politics, organize <lb/>
your strength, band together, and deliver the casting <lb/>
vote where you can, and where you can't, compel as <lb/>
good terms as possible. You huddle to yourselves <lb/>
already in all countries, but you huddle to no <lb/>
sufficient purpose, politically speaking. You do not <lb/>
seem to be organized, except for your charities. <lb/>
There you are omnipotent; there you compel your <lb/>
due of recognition&#x2014;you do not have to beg for it. <lb/>
It shows what you can do when you band together <lb/>
for a definite purpose.</p>
<p>And then from America and England you can <lb/>
encourage your race in Austria, France, and Ger- <lb/>
many, and materially help it. It was a pathetic tale <lb/>
that was told by a poor Jew in Galicia a fortnight <lb/>
ago during the riots, after he had been raided by <lb/>
the Christian peasantry and despoiled of everything <lb/>
he had. He said his vote was of no value to him, <lb/>
and he wished he could be excused from casting it, <lb/>
for indeed casting it was a sure <i>damage</i> to him, since <lb/>
no matter which party he voted for, the other party <lb/>
would come straight and take its revenge out of him. <lb/>
Nine per cent. of the population of the empire, <lb/>
these Jews, and apparently they cannot put a <lb/>
plank into any candidate's platform! If you will <lb/>
send our Irish lads over here I think they will <lb/>
<pb n="272"/>
organize your race and change the aspect of the <lb/>
Reichsrath.</p>
<p>You seem to think that the Jews take no hand in <lb/>
politics here, that they are "absolutely non- <lb/>
participants." I am assured by men competent to <lb/>
speak that this is a very large error, that the Jews <lb/>
are exceedingly active in politics all over the em- <lb/>
pire, but that they scatter their work and their votes <lb/>
among the numerous parties, and thus lose the ad- <lb/>
vantages to be had by concentration. I think that <lb/>
in America they scatter too, but you know more <lb/>
about that than I do.</p>
<p>Speaking of concentration, Dr. Herzl has a clear <lb/>
insight into the value of that. Have you heard of <lb/>
his plan? He wishes to gather the Jews of the world <lb/>
together in Palestine, with a government of their <lb/>
own&#x2014;under the suzerainty of the Sultan, I sup- <lb/>
pose. At the convention of Berne, last year, there <lb/>
were delegates from everywhere, and the proposal <lb/>
was received with decided favor. I am not the <lb/>
Sultan, and I am not objecting; but if that con- <lb/>
centration of the cunningest brains in the world was <lb/>
going to be made in a free country (bar Scotland), <lb/>
I think it would be politic to stop it. It will not be <lb/>
well to let that race find out its strength. If the <lb/>
horses knew theirs, we should not ride any more.</p>
<p><i>Point No. 5</i>.&#x2014;"Will the persecution of the Jews <lb/>
ever come to an end?"</p>
<p>On the score of religion, I think it has already <lb/>
come to an end. On the score of race prejudice <lb/>
<pb n="273"/>
and trade, I have the idea that it will continue. <lb/>
That is, here and there in spots about the world, <lb/>
where a barbarous ignorance and a sort of mere <lb/>
animal civilization prevail; but I do not think that <lb/>
elsewhere the Jew need now stand in any fear of <lb/>
being robbed and raided. Among the high civil- <lb/>
izations he seems to be very comfortably situated <lb/>
indeed, and to have more than his proportionate <lb/>
share of the prosperities going. It has that look in <lb/>
Vienna. I suppose the race prejudice cannot be <lb/>
removed; but he can stand that; it is no particular <lb/>
matter. By his make and ways he is substantially <lb/>
a foreigner wherever he may be, and even the angels <lb/>
dislike a foreigner. I am using this word foreigner <lb/>
in the German sense&#x2014;<i>stranger</i>. Nearly all of us <lb/>
have an antipathy to a stranger, even of our own <lb/>
nationality. We pile gripsacks in a vacant seat to <lb/>
keep him from getting it; and a dog goes further, <lb/>
and does as a savage would&#x2014;challenges him on the <lb/>
spot. The German dictionary seems to make no <lb/>
distinction between a stranger and a foreigner; in its <lb/>
view a stranger <i>is</i> a foreigner&#x2014;a sound position, I <lb/>
think. You will always be by ways and habits and <lb/>
predilections substantially strangers&#x2014;foreigners&#x2014; <lb/>
wherever you are, and that will probably keep the <lb/>
race prejudice against you alive.</p>
<p>But you were the favorites of Heaven originally, <lb/>
and your manifold and unfair prosperities convince <lb/>
me that you have crowded back into that snug place <lb/>
again. Here is an incident that is significant. Last <lb/>
<pb n="274"/>
week in Vienna a hail-storm struck the prodigious <lb/>
Central Cemetery and made wasteful destruction <lb/>
there. In the Christian part of it, according to the <lb/>
official figures, 621 window panes were broken; more <lb/>
than 900 singing-birds were killed; five great trees <lb/>
and many small ones were torn to shreds and the <lb/>
shreds scattered far and wide by the wind; the orna- <lb/>
mental plants and other decorations of the graves <lb/>
were ruined, and more than a hundred tomb-lanterns <lb/>
shattered; and it took the cemetery's whole force <lb/>
of 300 laborers more than three days to clear away <lb/>
the storm's wreckage. In the report occurs this <lb/>
remark&#x2014;and in its italics you can hear it grit its <lb/>
Christian teeth: "&#x2026;. lediglich die <i>israelitische</i> <lb/>
Abtheilung des Friedhofes vom Hagelwetter <i>ganz- <lb/>
lich verschont</i> worden war." Not a hailstone hit the <lb/>
Jewish reservation! Such nepotism makes me tired.</p>
<p><i>Point No. 6</i>.&#x2014;"What has become of the golden <lb/>
rule?"</p>
<p>It exists, it continues to sparkle, and is well taken <lb/>
care of. It is Exhibit A in the Church's assets, and <lb/>
we pull it out every Sunday and give it an airing. <lb/>
But you are not permitted to try to smuggle it into <lb/>
this discussion, where it is irrelevant and would not <lb/>
feel at home. It is strictly religious furniture, like <lb/>
an acolyte, or a contribution-plate, or any of those <lb/>
things. It has never been intruded into business; <lb/>
and Jewish persecution is not a religious passion, it <lb/>
is a business passion.</p>
<p><i>To conclude</i>.&#x2014;If the statistics are right, the Jews <lb/>
<pb n="275"/>
constitute but <i>one per cent</i>. of the human race. It <lb/>
suggests a nebulous dim puff of star dust lost in the <lb/>
blaze of the Milky Way. Properly the Jew ought <lb/>
hardly to be heard of; but he is heard of, has <lb/>
always been heard of. He is as prominent on the <lb/>
planet as any other people, and his commercial <lb/>
importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the <lb/>
smallness of his bulk. His contributions to the <lb/>
world's list of great names in literature, science, art, <lb/>
music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are <lb/>
also away out of proportion to the weakness of his <lb/>
numbers. He has made a marvelous fight in this <lb/>
world, in all the ages; and has done it with his <lb/>
hands tied behind him. He could be vain of him- <lb/>
self, and be excused for it. The Egyptian, the <lb/>
Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet <lb/>
with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff <lb/>
and passed away; the Greek and the Roman <lb/>
followed, and made a vast noise, and they are gone; <lb/>
other peoples have sprung up and held their torch <lb/>
high for a time, but it burned out, and they sit in <lb/>
twilight now, or have vanished. The Jew saw them <lb/>
all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, <lb/>
exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no <lb/>
weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no <lb/>
dulling of his alert and aggressive mind. All things <lb/>
are mortal but the Jew; all other forces pass, but he <lb/>
remains. What is the secret of his immortality?</p>

<p><smcap>I resume</smcap> by cable-telephone where I left off <lb/>
yesterday. For many hours, now, this vast city <lb/>
&#x2014;along with the rest of the globe, of course&#x2014;has <lb/>
talked of nothing but the extraordinary episode <lb/>
mentioned in my last report. In accordance with <lb/>
your instructions, I will now trace the romance from <lb/>
its beginnings down to the culmination of yesterday <lb/>
&#x2014;or to-day; call it which you like. By an odd <lb/>
chance, I was a personal actor in a part of this <lb/>
drama myself. The opening scene plays in Vienna. <lb/>
Date, one o'clock in the morning, March 31, 1898. <lb/>
I had spent the evening at a social entertainment. <lb/>
About midnight I went away, in company with <lb/>
the military attach&#x00E9;s of the British, Italian, and <lb/>
American embassies, to finish with a late smoke. <lb/>
This function had been appointed to take place in <lb/>
the house of Lieutenant Hillyer, the third attach&#x00E9; <lb/>
mentioned in the above list. When we arrived there <lb/>
we found several visitors in the room: young <lb/>
Szczepanik;<ref target="n18">*</ref><note id="n18" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Pronounced (approximately) Ze<i>pan</i>nik.</p></note> Mr. K., his financial backer; Mr. W., <lb/>
<pb n="277"/>
the latter's secretary; and Lieutenant Clayton of the <lb/>
United States army. War was at that time threat- <lb/>
ening between Spain and our country, and Lieutenant <lb/>
Clayton had been sent to Europe on military busi- <lb/>
ness. I was well acquainted with young Szczepanik <lb/>
and his two friends, and I knew Mr. Clayton slightly. <lb/>
I had met him at West Point years before, when he <lb/>
was a cadet. It was when General Merritt was <lb/>
superintendent. He had the reputation of being an <lb/>
able officer, and also of being quick-tempered and <lb/>
plain-spoken.</p>
<p>This smoking-party had been gathered together <lb/>
partly for business. This business was to consider <lb/>
the availability of the telelectroscope for military <lb/>
service. It sounds oddly enough now, but it is <lb/>
nevertheless true that at that time the invention was <lb/>
not taken seriously by any one except its inventor. <lb/>
Even his financial supporter regarded it merely as <lb/>
a curious and interesting toy. Indeed, he was so <lb/>
convinced of this that he had actually postponed its <lb/>
use by the general world to the end of the dying <lb/>
century by granting a two years' exclusive lease of <lb/>
it to a syndicate, whose intent was to exploit it at <lb/>
the Paris World's Fair.</p>
<p>When we entered the smoking-room we found <lb/>
Lieutenant Clayton and Szczepanik engaged in a <lb/>
warm talk over the telelectroscope in the German <lb/>
tongue. Clayton was saying:</p>
<p>"Well, you know <i>my</i> opinion of it, anyway!" and he <lb/>
brought his fist down with emphasis upon the table.</p>
<pb n="278"/>
<p>"And I do not value it," retorted the young in- <lb/>
ventor, with provoking calmness of tone and manner.</p>
<p>Clayton turned to Mr. K., and said:</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> cannot see why you are wasting money on <lb/>
this toy. In my opinion, the day will never come <lb/>
when it will do a farthing's worth of real service for <lb/>
any human being."</p>
<p>"That may be; yes, that may be; still, I have <lb/>
put the money in it, and am content. I think, <lb/>
myself, that it is only a toy; but Szczepanik claims <lb/>
more for it, and I know him well enough to believe <lb/>
that he can see farther than I can&#x2014;either with his <lb/>
telelectroscope or without it."</p>
<p>The soft answer did not cool Clayton down; it <lb/>
seemed only to irritate him the more; and he re- <lb/>
peated and emphasized his conviction that the in- <lb/>
vention would never do any man a farthing's worth <lb/>
of real service. He even made it a "brass" farthing, <lb/>
this time. Then he laid an English farthing on the <lb/>
table, and added:</p>
<p>"Take that, Mr. K., and put it away; and if ever <lb/>
the telelectroscope does any man an actual service, <lb/>
&#x2014;mind, a <i>real</i> service,&#x2014;please mail it to me as a <lb/>
reminder, and I will take back what I have been <lb/>
saying. Will you?"</p>
<p>"I will;" and Mr. K. put the coin in his pocket.</p>
<p>Mr. Clayton now turned toward Szczepanik, and <lb/>
began with a taunt&#x2014;a taunt which did not reach a <lb/>
finish; Szczepanik interrupted it with a hardy retort, <lb/>
and followed this with a blow. There was a brisk <lb/>
<pb n="279"/>
fight for a moment or two; then the attach&#x00E9;s <lb/>
separated the men.</p>
<p>The scene now changes to Chicago. Time, the <lb/>
autumn of 1901. As soon as the Paris contract <lb/>
released the telelectroscope, it was delivered to <lb/>
public use, and was soon connected with the tele- <lb/>
phonic systems of the whole world. The improved <lb/>
"limitless-distance" telephone was presently in- <lb/>
troduced, and the daily doings of the globe made <lb/>
visible to everybody, and audibly discussable, too, <lb/>
by witnesses separated by any number of leagues.</p>
<p>By and by Szczepanik arrived in Chicago. Clay- <lb/>
ton (now captain) was serving in that military de- <lb/>
partment at the time. The two men resumed the <lb/>
Viennese quarrel of 1898. On three different <lb/>
occasions they quarreled, and were separated by <lb/>
witnesses. Then came an interval of two months, <lb/>
during which time Szczepanik was not seen by any <lb/>
of his friends, and it was at first supposed that he <lb/>
had gone off on a sight-seeing tour and would soon <lb/>
be heard from. But no; no word came from him. <lb/>
Then it was supposed that he had returned to <lb/>
Europe. Still, time drifted on, and he was not <lb/>
heard from. Nobody was troubled, for he was like <lb/>
most inventors and other kinds of poets, and went <lb/>
and came in a capricious way, and often without <lb/>
notice.</p>
<p>Now comes the tragedy. On the 29th of <lb/>
December, in a dark and unused compartment of <lb/>
the cellar under Captain Clayton's house, a corpse <lb/>
<pb n="280"/>
was discovered by one of Clayton's maid-servants. <lb/>
It was easily identified as Szczepanik's. The man <lb/>
had died by violence. Clayton was arrested, in- <lb/>
dicted, and brought to trial, charged with this <lb/>
murder. The evidence against him was perfect in <lb/>
every detail, and absolutely unassailable. Clayton <lb/>
admitted this himself. He said that a reasonable <lb/>
man could not examine this testimony with a dis- <lb/>
passionate mind and not be convinced by it; yet <lb/>
the man would be in error, nevertheless. Clayton <lb/>
swore that he did not commit the murder, and that <lb/>
he had had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>As your readers will remember, he was con- <lb/>
demned to death. He had numerous and powerful <lb/>
friends, and they worked hard to save him, for none <lb/>
of them doubted the truth of his assertion. I did <lb/>
what little I could to help, for I had long since <lb/>
become a close friend of his, and thought I knew <lb/>
that it was not in his character to inveigle an enemy <lb/>
into a corner and assassinate him. During 1902 <lb/>
and 1903 he was several times reprieved by the <lb/>
governor; he was reprieved once more in the be- <lb/>
ginning of the present year, and the execution-day <lb/>
postponed to March 31st.</p>
<p>The governor's situation has been embarrassing, <lb/>
from the day of the condemnation, because of the <lb/>
fact that Clayton's wife is the governor's niece. <lb/>
The marriage took place in 1899, when Clayton was <lb/>
thirty-four and the girl twenty-three, and has been a <lb/>
happy one. There is one child, a little girl three <lb/>
<pb n="281"/>
years old. Pity for the poor mother and child <lb/>
kept the mouths of grumblers closed at first; but <lb/>
this could not last forever,&#x2014;for in America politics <lb/>
has a hand in everything,&#x2014;and by and by the <lb/>
governor's political opponents began to call at- <lb/>
tention to his delay in allowing the law to take its <lb/>
course. These hints have grown more and more <lb/>
frequent of late, and more and more pronounced. <lb/>
As a natural result, his own party grew nervous. <lb/>
Its leaders began to visit Springfield and hold long <lb/>
private conferences with him. He was now between <lb/>
two fires. On the one hand, his niece was imploring <lb/>
him to pardon her husband; on the other were the <lb/>
leaders, insisting that he stand to his plain duty as <lb/>
chief magistrate of the State, and place no further <lb/>
bar to Clayton's execution. Duty won in the <lb/>
struggle, and the governor gave his word that he <lb/>
would not again respite the condemned man. This <lb/>
was two weeks ago. Mrs. Clayton now said:</p>
<p>"Now that you have given your word, my last <lb/>
hope is gone, for I know you will never go back <lb/>
from it. But you have done the best you could for <lb/>
John, and I have no reproaches for you. You love <lb/>
him, and you love me, and we both know that if you <lb/>
could honorably save him, you would do it. I will <lb/>
go to him now, and be what help I can to him, and <lb/>
get what comfort I may out of the few days that are <lb/>
left to us before the night comes which will have no <lb/>
end for me in life. You will be with me that day? <lb/>
You will not let me bear it alone?"</p>
<pb n="282"/>
<p>"I will take you to him myself, poor child, and <lb/>
I will be near you to the last."</p>
<p>By the governor's command, Clayton was now <lb/>
allowed every indulgence he might ask for which <lb/>
could interest his mind and soften the hardships of <lb/>
his imprisonment. His wife and child spent the <lb/>
days with him; I was his companion by night. He <lb/>
was removed from the narrow cell which he had <lb/>
occupied during such a dreary stretch of time, and <lb/>
given the chief warden's roomy and comfortable <lb/>
quarters. His mind was always busy with the <lb/>
catastrophe of his life, and with the slaughtered <lb/>
inventor, and he now took the fancy that he would <lb/>
like to have the telelectroscope and divert his mind <lb/>
with it. He had his wish. The connection was <lb/>
made with the international telephone-station, and <lb/>
day by day, and night by night, he called up one <lb/>
corner of the globe after another, and looked upon <lb/>
its life, and studied its strange sights, and spoke <lb/>
with its people, and realized that by grace of this <lb/>
marvelous instrument he was almost as free as the <lb/>
birds of the air, although a prisoner under locks <lb/>
and bars. He seldom spoke, and I never inter- <lb/>
rupted him when he was absorbed in this amuse- <lb/>
ment. I sat in his parlor and read and smoked, and <lb/>
the nights were very quiet and reposefully sociable, <lb/>
and I found them pleasant. Now and then I would <lb/>
hear him say, "Give me Yedo"; next, "Give me <lb/>
Hong-Kong"; next, "Give me Melbourne." And <lb/>
I smoked on, and read in comfort, while he wandered <lb/>
<pb n="283"/>
about the remote under-world, where the sun was <lb/>
shining in the sky, and the people were at their daily <lb/>
work. Sometimes the talk that came from those far <lb/>
regions through the microphone attachment in- <lb/>
terested me, and I listened.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#x2014;I keep calling it yesterday, which is <lb/>
quite natural, for certain reasons&#x2014;the instrument <lb/>
remained unused, and that, also, was natural, for it <lb/>
was the eve of the execution-day. It was spent in <lb/>
tears and lamentations and farewells. The governor <lb/>
and the wife and child remained until a quarter past <lb/>
eleven at night, and the scenes I witnessed were <lb/>
pitiful to see. The execution was to take place at <lb/>
four in the morning. A little after eleven a sound <lb/>
of hammering broke out upon the still night, and <lb/>
there was a glare of light, and the child cried out, <lb/>
"What is that, papa?" and ran to the window be- <lb/>
fore she could be stopped, and clapped her small <lb/>
hands, and said: "Oh, come and see, mama&#x2014;such <lb/>
a pretty thing they are making!" The mother <lb/>
knew&#x2014;and fainted. It was the gallows!</p>
<p>She was carried away to her lodging, poor <lb/>
woman, and Clayton and I were alone&#x2014;alone, and <lb/>
thinking, brooding, dreaming. We might have been <lb/>
statues, we sat so motionless and still. It was a <lb/>
wild night, for winter was come again for a moment, <lb/>
after the habit of this region in the early spring. <lb/>
The sky was starless and black, and a strong wind <lb/>
was blowing from the lake. The silence in the room <lb/>
was so deep that all outside sounds seemed exag- <lb/>
<pb n="284"/>
gerated by contrast with it. These sounds were <lb/>
fitting ones; they harmonized with the situation and <lb/>
the conditions: the boom and thunder of sudden <lb/>
storm-gusts among the roofs and chimneys, then the <lb/>
dying down into moanings and wailings about the <lb/>
eaves and angles; now and then a gnashing and <lb/>
lashing rush of sleet along the window-panes; and <lb/>
always the muffled and uncanny hammering of the <lb/>
gallows-builders in the courtyard. After an age of <lb/>
this, another sound&#x2014;far off, and coming smothered <lb/>
and faint through the riot of the tempest&#x2014;a bell <lb/>
tolling twelve! Another age, and it tolled again. <lb/>
By and by, again. A dreary, long interval after <lb/>
this, then the spectral sound floated to us once more <lb/>
&#x2014;one, two, three; and this time we caught our <lb/>
breath: sixty minutes of life left!</p>
<p>Clayton rose, and stood by the window, and <lb/>
looked up into the black sky, and listened to the <lb/>
thrashing sleet and the piping wind; then he said: <lb/>
"That a dying man's last of earth should be&#x2014;this!" <lb/>
After a little he said: "I must see the sun again&#x2014; <lb/>
the sun!" and the next moment he was feverishly <lb/>
calling: "China! Give me China&#x2014;Peking!"</p>
<p>I was strangely stirred, and said to myself: "To <lb/>
think that it is a mere human being who does this <lb/>
unimaginable miracle&#x2014;turns winter into summer, <lb/>
night into day, storm into calm, gives the freedom <lb/>
of the great globe to a prisoner in his cell, and the <lb/>
sun in his naked splendor to a man dying in <lb/>
Egyptian darkness!"</p>
<pb n="285"/>
<p>I was listening.</p>
<p>"What light! what brilliancy! what radiance! &#x2026; <lb/>
This is Peking?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The time?"</p>
<p>"Mid-afternoon."</p>
<p>"What is the great crowd for, and in such <lb/>
gorgeous costumes? What masses and masses of <lb/>
rich color and barbaric magnificence! And how <lb/>
they flash and glow and burn in the flooding sun- <lb/>
light! What <i>is</i> the occasion of it all?"</p>
<p>"The coronation of our new emperor&#x2014;the <lb/>
Czar."</p>
<p>"But I thought that that was to take place <lb/>
yesterday."</p>
<p>"This <i>is</i> yesterday&#x2014;to you."</p>
<p>"Certainly it is. But my mind is confused, these <lb/>
days; there are reasons for it&#x2026; Is this the be- <lb/>
ginning of the procession?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no; it began to move an hour ago."</p>
<p>"Is there much more of it still to come?"</p>
<p>"Two hours of it. Why do you sigh?"</p>
<p>"Because I should like to see it all."</p>
<p>"And why can't you?"</p>
<p>"I have to go&#x2014;presently."</p>
<p>"You have an engagement?"</p>
<p>After a pause, softly: "Yes." After another <lb/>
pause: "Who are these in the splendid pavilion?"</p>
<p>"The imperial family, and visiting royalties from <lb/>
here and there and yonder in the earth."</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>"And who are those in the adjoining pavilions to <lb/>
the right and left?"</p>
<p>"Ambassadors and their families and suites to the <lb/>
right; unofficial foreigners to the left."</p>
<p>"If you will be so good, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p><i>Boom!</i> That distant bell again, tolling the half- <lb/>
hour faintly through the tempest of wind and sleet. <lb/>
The door opened, and the governor and the mother <lb/>
and child entered&#x2014;the woman in widow's weeds! <lb/>
She fell upon her husband's breast in a passion of <lb/>
sobs, and I&#x2014;I could not stay; I could not bear it. <lb/>
I went into the bedchamber, and closed the door. <lb/>
I sat there waiting&#x2014;waiting&#x2014;waiting, and listen- <lb/>
ing to the rattling sashes and the blustering of the <lb/>
storm. After what seemed a long, long time, I <lb/>
heard a rustle and movement in the parlor, and <lb/>
knew that the clergyman and the sheriff and the <lb/>
guard were come. There was some low-voiced <lb/>
talking; then a hush; then a prayer, with a sound <lb/>
of sobbing; presently, footfalls&#x2014;the departure for <lb/>
the gallows; then the child's happy voice: "Don't <lb/>
cry <i>now</i>, mama, when we've got papa again, and <lb/>
taking him home."</p>
<p>The door closed; they were gone. I was ashamed: <lb/>
I was the only friend of the dying man that had no <lb/>
spirit, no courage. I stepped into the room, and <lb/>
said I would be a man and would follow. But we <lb/>
are made as we are made, and we cannot help it. I <lb/>
did not go.</p>
<p>I fidgeted about the room nervously, and presently <lb/>
<pb n="287"/>
went to the window, and softly raised it,&#x2014;drawn <lb/>
by that dread fascination which the terrible and the <lb/>
awful exert,&#x2014;and looked down upon the courtyard. <lb/>
By the garish light of the electric lamps I saw the <lb/>
little group of privileged witnesses, the wife crying <lb/>
on her uncle's breast, the condemned man standing <lb/>
on the scaffold with the halter around his neck, his <lb/>
arms strapped to his body, the black cap on his <lb/>
head, the sheriff at his side with his hand on the <lb/>
drop, the clergyman in front of him with bare head <lb/>
and his book in his hand.</p>
<p>"<i>I am the resurrection and the life&#x2014;</i>"</p>
<p>I turned away. I could not listen; I could not <lb/>
look. I did not know whither to go or what to do. <lb/>
Mechanically, and without knowing it, I put my eye <lb/>
to that strange instrument, and there was Peking <lb/>
and the Czar's procession! The next moment I was <lb/>
leaning out of the window, gasping, suffocating, <lb/>
trying to speak, but dumb from the very imminence <lb/>
of the necessity of speaking. The preacher could <lb/>
speak, but I, who had such need of words&#x2014;</p>
<p>"<i>And may God have mercy upon your soul. <lb/>
Amen.</i>"</p>
<p>The sheriff drew down the black cap, and laid his <lb/>
hand upon the lever. I got my voice.</p>
<p>"Stop, for God's sake! The man is innocent. <lb/>
Come here and see Szczepanik face to face!"</p>
<p>Hardly three minutes later the governor had my <lb/>
place at the window, and was saying:</p>
<p>"Strike off his bonds and set him free!"</p>
<pb n="288"/>
<p>Three minutes later all were in the parlor again. <lb/>
The reader will imagine the scene; I have no need <lb/>
to describe it. It was a sort of mad orgy of joy.</p>
<p>A messenger carried word to Szczepanik in the <lb/>
pavilion, and one could see the distressed amaze- <lb/>
ment dawn in his face as he listened to the tale. <lb/>
Then he came to his end of the line, and talked with <lb/>
Clayton and the governor and the others; and the <lb/>
wife poured out her gratitude upon him for saving <lb/>
her husband's life, and in her deep thankfulness she <lb/>
kissed him at twelve thousand miles' range.</p>
<p>The telelectrophonoscopes of the globe were put <lb/>
to service now, and for many hours the kings and <lb/>
queens of many realms (with here and there a re- <lb/>
porter) talked with Szczepanik, and praised him; <lb/>
and the few scientific societies which had not already <lb/>
made him an honorary member conferred that grace <lb/>
upon him.</p>
<p>How had he come to disappear from among us? <lb/>
It was easily explained. He had not grown used to <lb/>
being a world-famous person, and had been forced <lb/>
to break away from the lionizing that was robbing <lb/>
him of all privacy and repose. So he grew a beard, <lb/>
put on colored glasses, disguised himself a little in <lb/>
other ways, then took a fictitious name, and went <lb/>
off to wander about the earth in peace.</p>
<p>Such is the tale of the drama which began with <lb/>
an inconsequential quarrel in Vienna in the spring <lb/>
of 1898, and came near ending as a tragedy in the <lb/>
spring of 1904.</p>

<p><smcap>Now</smcap> that the after developments of the Clayton <lb/>
case have run their course and reached a <lb/>
finish, I will sum them up. Clayton's romantic <lb/>
escape from a shameful death steeped all this region <lb/>
in an enchantment of wonder and joy&#x2014;during the <lb/>
proverbial nine days. Then the sobering process <lb/>
followed, and men began to take thought, and to <lb/>
say: "But <i>a man was killed</i>, and Clayton killed <lb/>
him." Others replied: "That is true: we have <lb/>
been overlooking that important detail; we have <lb/>
been led away by excitement."</p>
<p>The feeling soon became general that Clayton <lb/>
ought to be tried again. Measures were taken <lb/>
<pb n="290"/>
accordingly, and the proper representations con- <lb/>
veyed to Washington; for in America, under the <lb/>
new paragraph added to the Constitution in 1899, <lb/>
second trials are not State affairs, but national, and <lb/>
must be tried by the most august body in the land <lb/>
&#x2014;the Supreme Court of the United States. The <lb/>
justices were, therefore, summoned to sit in Chicago. <lb/>
The session was held day before yesterday, and <lb/>
was opened with the usual impressive formalities, <lb/>
the nine judges appearing in their black robes, and <lb/>
the new chief justice (Lemaitre) presiding. In <lb/>
opening the case, the chief justice said:</p>
<p>"It is my opinion that this matter is quite simple. <lb/>
The prisoner at the bar was charged with murdering <lb/>
the man Szczepanik; he was tried for murdering the <lb/>
man Szczepanik; he was fairly tried, and justly con- <lb/>
demned and sentenced to death for murdering the <lb/>
man Szczepanik. It turns out that the man Szcze- <lb/>
panik was not murdered at all. By the decision of <lb/>
the French courts in the Dreyfus matter, it is <lb/>
established beyond cavil or question that the de- <lb/>
cisions of courts are permanent and cannot be re- <lb/>
vised. We are obliged to respect and adopt this <lb/>
precedent. It is upon precedents that the enduring <lb/>
edifice of jurisprudence is reared. The prisoner at <lb/>
the bar has been fairly and righteously condemned to <lb/>
death for the murder of the man Szczepanik, and, in <lb/>
my opinion, there is but one course to pursue in the <lb/>
matter: he must be hanged."</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Crawford said:</p>
<pb n="291"/>
<p>"But, your Excellency, he was pardoned on the <lb/>
scaffold for that."</p>
<p>"The pardon is not valid, and cannot stand, <lb/>
because he was pardoned for killing a man whom he <lb/>
had not killed. A man cannot be pardoned for a <lb/>
crime which he has not committed; it would be an <lb/>
absurdity."</p>
<p>"But, your Excellency, he did kill a man."</p>
<p>"That is an extraneous detail; we have nothing <lb/>
to do with it. The court cannot take up this crime <lb/>
until the prisoner has expiated the other one."</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Halleck said:</p>
<p>"If we order his execution, your Excellency, we <lb/>
shall bring about a miscarriage of justice; for the <lb/>
governor will pardon him again."</p>
<p>"He will not have the power. He cannot pardon <lb/>
a man for a crime which he has not committed. As <lb/>
I observed before, it would be an absurdity."</p>
<p>After a consultation, Mr. Justice Wadsworth said:</p>
<p>"Several of us have arrived at the conclusion, <lb/>
your Excellency, that it would be an error to hang <lb/>
the prisoner for killing Szczepanik, but only for <lb/>
killing the other man, since it is proven that he did <lb/>
not kill Szczepanik."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, it is proven that he <i>did</i> kill <lb/>
Szczepanik. By the French precedent, it is plain <lb/>
that we must abide by the finding of the court."</p>
<p>"But Szczepanik is still alive."</p>
<p>"So is Dreyfus."</p>
<p>In the end it was found impossible to ignore or <lb/>
<pb n="292"/>
get around the French precedent. There could be <lb/>
but one result: Clayton was delivered over to the <lb/>
executioner. It made an immense excitement; the <lb/>
State rose as one man and clamored for Clayton's <lb/>
pardon and re-trial. The governor issued the <lb/>
pardon, but the Supreme Court was in duty bound <lb/>
to annul it, and did so, and poor Clayton was <lb/>
hanged yesterday. The city is draped in black, and, <lb/>
indeed, the like may be said of the State. All <lb/>
America is vocal with scorn of "French justice," <lb/>
and of the malignant little soldiers who invented it <lb/>
and inflicted it upon the other Christian lands.</p>

<head><b>AT THE APPETITE CURE</b></head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> establishment's name is Hochberghaus. It <lb/>
is in Bohemia, a short day's journey from <lb/>
Vienna, and being in the Austrian empire is, of <lb/>
course, a health resort. The empire is made up of <lb/>
health resorts; it distributes health to the whole <lb/>
world. Its waters are all medicinal. They are <lb/>
bottled and sent throughout the earth; the natives <lb/>
themselves drink beer. This is self-sacrifice, appar- <lb/>
ently&#x2014;but outlanders who have drunk Vienna beer <lb/>
have another idea about it. Particularly the Pilse- <lb/>
ner which one gets in a small cellar up an obscure <lb/>
back lane in the First Bezirk&#x2014;the name has escaped <lb/>
me, but the place is easily found: You inquire for <lb/>
the Greek church; and when you get to it, go right <lb/>
along by&#x2014;the next house is that little beer-mill. <lb/>
It is remote from all traffic and all noise; it is always <lb/>
Sunday there. There are two small rooms, with low <lb/>
ceilings supported by massive arches; the arches and <lb/>
ceilings are whitewashed, otherwise the rooms would <lb/>
pass for cells in the dungeons of a bastile. The <lb/>
furniture is plain and cheap, there is no ornamen- <lb/>
tation anywhere; yet it is a heaven for the self- <lb/>
sacrificers, for the beer there is incomparable; there <lb/>
<pb n="294"/>
is nothing like it elsewhere in the world. In the first <lb/>
room you will find twelve or fifteen ladies and gentle- <lb/>
men of civilian quality; in the other one a dozen <lb/>
generals and ambassadors. One may live in Vienna <lb/>
many months and not hear of this place; but having <lb/>
once heard of it and sampled it the sampler will <lb/>
afterward infest it.</p>
<p>However, this is all incidental&#x2014;a mere passing <lb/>
note of gratitude for blessings received&#x2014;it has <lb/>
nothing to do with my subject. My subject is health <lb/>
resorts. All unhealthy people ought to domicile <lb/>
themselves in Vienna, and use that as a base, <lb/>
making flights from time to time to the outlying <lb/>
resorts, according to need. A flight to Marien- <lb/>
bad to get rid of fat; a flight to Carlsbad to get <lb/>
rid of rheumatism; a flight to Kaltenleutgeben to <lb/>
take the water cure and get rid of the rest of the <lb/>
diseases. It is all so handy. You can stand in <lb/>
Vienna and toss a biscuit into Kaltenleutgeben, <lb/>
with a twelve-inch gun. You can run out thither <lb/>
at any time of the day; you go by the phenom- <lb/>
enally slow trains, and yet inside of an hour you <lb/>
have exchanged the glare and swelter of the city <lb/>
for wooded hills, and shady forest paths, and soft <lb/>
cool airs, and the music of birds, and the repose <lb/>
and peace of paradise.</p>
<p>And there are plenty of other health resorts at <lb/>
your service and convenient to get at from Vienna; <lb/>
charming places, all of them; Vienna sits in the <lb/>
center of a beautiful world of mountains with now <lb/>
<pb n="295"/>
and then a lake and forests; in fact, no other city <lb/>
is so fortunately situated.</p>
<p>There are abundance of health resorts, as I have <lb/>
said. Among them this place&#x2014;Hochberghaus. It <lb/>
stands solitary on the top of a densely wooded <lb/>
mountain, and is a building of great size. It is <lb/>
called the Appetite Anstallt, and people who have <lb/>
lost their appetites come here to get them restored. <lb/>
When I arrived I was taken by Professor Haimberger <lb/>
to his consulting-room and questioned:</p>
<p>"It is six o'clock. When did you eat last?"</p>
<p>"At noon."</p>
<p>"What did you eat?"</p>
<p>"Next to nothing."</p>
<p>"What was on the table?"</p>
<p>"The usual things."</p>
<p>"Chops, chickens, vegetables, and so on?"</p>
<p>"Yes; but don't mention them&#x2014;I can't bear <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>"Are you tired of them?"</p>
<p>"Oh, utterly. I wish I might never hear of them <lb/>
again."</p>
<p>"The mere sight of food offends you, does it?"</p>
<p>"More, it revolts me."</p>
<p>The doctor considered awhile, then got out a long <lb/>
menu and ran his eye slowly down it.</p>
<p>"I think," said he, "that what you need to eat <lb/>
is&#x2014;but here, choose for yourself."</p>
<p>I glanced at the list, and my stomach threw a <lb/>
handspring. Of all the barbarous layouts that were <lb/>
<pb n="296"/>
ever contrived, this was the most atrocious. At the <lb/>
top stood "tough, underdone, overdue tripe, <lb/>
garnished with garlic"; half-way down the bill stood <lb/>
"young cat; old cat; scrambled cat"; at the <lb/>
bottom stood "sailor-boots, softened with tallow&#x2014; <lb/>
served raw." The wide intervals of the bill were <lb/>
packed with dishes calculated to insult a cannibal. <lb/>
I said:</p>
<p>"Doctor, it is not fair to joke over so serious a <lb/>
case as mine. I came here to get an appetite, not to <lb/>
throw away the remnant that's left."</p>
<p>He said gravely: "I am not joking, why should <lb/>
I joke?"</p>
<p>"But I can't eat these horrors."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>He said it with a na&#x00EF;vet&#x00E9; that was admirable, <lb/>
whether it was real or assumed.</p>
<p>"Why not? Because&#x2014;why, doctor, for months <lb/>
I have seldom been able to endure anything more <lb/>
substantial than omelettes and custards. These un- <lb/>
speakable dishes of yours&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, you will come to like them. They are very <lb/>
good. And you <i>must</i> eat them. It is the rule of <lb/>
the place, and is strict. I cannot permit any de- <lb/>
parture from it."</p>
<p>I said smiling: "Well, then, doctor, you will have <lb/>
to permit the departure of the patient. I am <lb/>
going."</p>
<p>He looked hurt, and said in a way which changed <lb/>
the aspect of things:</p>
<pb n="297"/>
<p>"I am sure you would not do me that injustice, <lb/>
I accepted you in good faith&#x2014;you will not shame <lb/>
that confidence. This appetite-cure is my whole <lb/>
living. If you should go forth from it with the sort <lb/>
of appetite which you now have, it could become <lb/>
known, and you can see, yourself, that people would <lb/>
say my cure failed in your case and hence can fail <lb/>
in other cases. You will not go; you will not do <lb/>
me this hurt."</p>
<p>I apologized and said I would stay.</p>
<p>"That is right. I was sure you would not go; <lb/>
it would take the food from my family's mouths."</p>
<p>"Would they mind that? Do they eat these fiend- <lb/>
ish things?"</p>
<p>"They? My family?" His eyes were full of <lb/>
gentle wonder. "Of course not."</p>
<p>"Oh, they don't! Do you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"I see. It's another case of a physician who <lb/>
doesn't take his own medicine."</p>
<p>"I don't need it. It is six hours since you <lb/>
lunched. Will you have supper now&#x2014;or later?"</p>
<p>"I am not hungry, but now is as good a time as <lb/>
any, and I would like to be done with it and have it <lb/>
off my mind. It is about my usual time, and regularity <lb/>
is commanded by all the authorities. Yes, I will try <lb/>
to nibble a little now&#x2014;I wish a light horsewhipping <lb/>
would answer instead."</p>
<p>The professor handed me that odious menu.</p>
<p>"Choose&#x2014;or will you have it later?"</p>
<pb n="298"/>
<p>"Oh, dear me, show me to my room; I forgot <lb/>
your hard rule."</p>
<p>"Wait just a moment before you finally decide. <lb/>
There is another rule. If you choose now, the order <lb/>
will be filled at once; but if you wait, you will have <lb/>
to await my pleasure. You cannot get a dish from <lb/>
that entire bill until I consent."</p>
<p>"All right. Show me to my room, and send the <lb/>
cook to bed; there is not going to be any hurry."</p>
<p>The professor took me up one flight of stairs and <lb/>
showed me into a most inviting and comfortable apart- <lb/>
ment consisting of parlor, bedchamber, and bath- <lb/>
room.</p>
<p>The front windows looked out over a far-reaching <lb/>
spread of green glades and valleys, and tumbled hills <lb/>
clothed with forests&#x2014;a noble solitude unvexed by <lb/>
the fussy world. In the parlor were many shelves <lb/>
filled with books. The professor said he would now <lb/>
leave me to myself; and added:</p>
<p>"Smoke and read as much as you please, drink <lb/>
all the water you like. When you get hungry, ring <lb/>
and give your order, and I will decide whether it shall <lb/>
be filled or not. Yours is a stubborn, bad case, and <lb/>
I think the first fourteen dishes in the bill are each <lb/>
and all too delicate for its needs. I ask you as a <lb/>
favor to restrain yourself and not call for them."</p>
<p>"Restrain myself, is it? Give yourself no uneasi- <lb/>
ness. You are going to save money by me. The <lb/>
idea of coaxing a sick man's appetite back with this <lb/>
buzzard-fare is clear insanity."</p>
<pb n="299"/>
<p>I said it with bitterness, for I felt outraged by this <lb/>
calm, cold talk over these heartless new engines of <lb/>
assassination. The doctor looked grieved, but not <lb/>
offended. He laid the bill of fare on the commode <lb/>
at my bed's head, "so that it would be handy," <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"Yours is not the worst case I have encountered, <lb/>
by any means; still it is a bad one and requires <lb/>
robust treatment; therefore I shall be gratified if you <lb/>
will restrain yourself and skip down to No. 15 and <lb/>
begin with that."</p>
<p>Then he left me and I began to undress, for I was <lb/>
dog-tired and very sleepy. I slept fifteen hours and <lb/>
woke up finely refreshed at ten the next morning. <lb/>
Vienna coffee! It was the first thing I thought of&#x2014; <lb/>
that unapproachable luxury&#x2014;that sumptuous coffee- <lb/>
house coffee, compared with which all other European <lb/>
coffee and all American hotel coffee is mere fluid <lb/>
poverty. I rang, and ordered it; also Vienna bread, <lb/>
that delicious invention. The servant spoke through <lb/>
the wicket in the door and said&#x2014;but you know what <lb/>
he said. He referred me to the bill of fare. I <lb/>
allowed him to go&#x2014;I had no further use for him.</p>
<p>After the bath I dressed and started for a walk, <lb/>
and got as far as the door. It was locked on the <lb/>
outside. I rang and the servant came and explained <lb/>
that it was another rule. The seclusion of the patient <lb/>
was required until after the first meal. I had not <lb/>
been particularly anxious to get out before; but it <lb/>
was different now. Being locked in makes a person <lb/>
<pb n="300"/>
wishful to get out. I soon began to find it difficult <lb/>
to put in the time. At two o'clock I had been <lb/>
twenty-six hours without food. I had been growing <lb/>
hungry for some time; I recognized that I was <lb/>
not only hungry now, but hungry with a strong <lb/>
adjective in front of it. Yet I was not hungry <lb/>
enough to face the bill of fare.</p>
<p>I must put in the time somehow. I would read <lb/>
and smoke. I did it; hour by hour. The books <lb/>
were all of one breed&#x2014;shipwrecks; people lost in <lb/>
deserts; people shut up in caved-in mines; people <lb/>
starving in besieged cities. I read about all the <lb/>
revolting dishes that ever famishing men had stayed <lb/>
their hunger with. During the first hours these things <lb/>
nauseated me; hours followed in which they did not <lb/>
so affect me; still other hours followed in which I <lb/>
found myself smacking my lips over some tolerably <lb/>
infernal messes. When I had been without food <lb/>
forty-five hours I ran eagerly to the bell and ordered <lb/>
the second dish in the bill, which was a sort of <lb/>
dumplings containing a compost made of caviar and <lb/>
tar.</p>
<p>It was refused me. During the next fifteen hours <lb/>
I visited the bell every now and then and ordered a <lb/>
dish that was further down the list. Always a re- <lb/>
fusal. But I was conquering prejudice after prej- <lb/>
udice, right along; I was making sure progress; I <lb/>
was sreeping up on No. 15 with deadly certainty, <lb/>
and my heart beat faster and faster, my hopes rose <lb/>
higher and higher.</p>
<pb n="301"/>
<p>At last when food had not passed my lips for <lb/>
sixty hours, victory was mine, and I ordered No. <lb/>
15:</p>
<p>"Soft-boiled spring chicken&#x2014;in the egg; six <lb/>
dozen, hot and fragrant!"</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes it was there; and the doctor <lb/>
along with it, rubbing his hands with joy. He said <lb/>
with great excitement:</p>
<p>"It's a cure, it's a cure! I knew I could do it. <lb/>
Dear sir, my grand system never fails&#x2014;never. <lb/>
You've got your appetite back&#x2014;you know you <lb/>
have; say it and make me happy."</p>
<p>"Bring on your carrion&#x2014;I can eat anything in <lb/>
the bill!"</p>
<p>"Oh, this is noble, this is splendid&#x2014;but I knew <lb/>
I could do it, the system never fails. How are the <lb/>
birds?"</p>
<p>"Never was anything so delicious in the world; <lb/>
and yet as a rule I don't care for game. But don't <lb/>
interrupt me, don't&#x2014;I can't spare my mouth, I <lb/>
really can't."</p>
<p>Then the doctor said:</p>
<p>"The cure is perfect. There is no more doubt <lb/>
nor danger. Let the poultry alone; I can trust you <lb/>
with a beefsteak, now."</p>
<p>The beefsteak came&#x2014;as much as a basketful of <lb/>
it&#x2014;with potatoes, and Vienna bread and coffee; <lb/>
and I ate a meal then that was worth all the costly <lb/>
preparation I had made for it. And dripped tears <lb/>
of gratitude into the gravy all the time&#x2014;gratitude <lb/>
<pb n="302"/>
to the doctor for putting a little plain common sense <lb/>
into me when I had been empty of it so many, many <lb/>
years.</p>

<head>II</head>
<p>Thirty years ago Haimberger went off on a long <lb/>
voyage in a sailing-ship. There were fifteen pas- <lb/>
sengers on board. The table-fare was of the regula- <lb/>
tion pattern of the day: At 7 in the morning, a cup <lb/>
of bad coffee in bed; at 9, breakfast: bad coffee, <lb/>
with condensed milk; soggy rolls, crackers, salt fish; <lb/>
at 1 P. M., luncheon: cold tongue, cold ham, cold <lb/>
corned beef, soggy cold rolls, crackers; 5 P. M., <lb/>
dinner: thick pea soup, salt fish, hot corned beef <lb/>
and sauerkraut, boiled pork and beans, pudding; <lb/>
9 till 11 P. M., supper: tea, with condensed <lb/>
milk, cold tongue, cold ham, pickles, sea biscuit, <lb/>
pickled oysters, pickled pig's feet, grilled bones, <lb/>
golden buck.</p>
<p>At the end of the first week eating had ceased, <lb/>
nibbling had taken its place. The passengers came <lb/>
to the table, but it was partly to put in the time, and <lb/>
partly because the wisdom of the ages commanded <lb/>
them to be regular in their meals. They were tired <lb/>
of the coarse and monotonous fare, and took no <lb/>
interest in it, had no appetite for it. All day <lb/>
and every day they roamed the ship half hungry, <lb/>
plagued by their gnawing stomachs, moody, untalk- <lb/>
ative, miserable. Among them were three confirmed <lb/>
dyspeptics. These became shadows in the course <lb/>
of three weeks. There was also a bedridden invalid; <lb/>
<pb n="303"/>
he lived on boiled rice; he could not look at the <lb/>
regular dishes.</p>
<p>Now came shipwreck and life in open boats, <lb/>
with the usual paucity of food. Provisions ran lower <lb/>
and lower. The appetites improved, then. When <lb/>
nothing was left but raw ham and the ration of that <lb/>
was down to two ounces a day per person, the <lb/>
appetites were perfect. At the end of fifteen days <lb/>
the dyspeptics, the invalid and the most delicate <lb/>
ladies in the party were chewing sailor-boots in <lb/>
ecstasy, and only complaining because the supply of <lb/>
them was limited. Yet these were the same people <lb/>
who couldn't endure the ship's tedious corned beef <lb/>
and sauerkraut and other crudities. They were <lb/>
rescued by an English vessel. Within ten days the <lb/>
whole fifteen were in as good condition as they had <lb/>
been when the shipwreck occurred.</p>
<p>"They had suffered no damage by their adven- <lb/>
ture," said the professor. "Do you note that?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do you note it well?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;I think I do."</p>
<p>"But you don't. You hesitate. You don't <lb/>
rise to the importance of it. I will say it again <lb/>
&#x2014;with emphasis&#x2014;<i>not one of them suffered any <lb/>
damage</i>."</p>
<p>"Now I begin to see. Yes, it was indeed re- <lb/>
markable."</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind. It was perfectly natural. <lb/>
There was no reason why they should suffer damage. <lb/>
<pb n="304"/>
They were undergoing Nature's Appetite Cure, the <lb/>
best and wisest in the world."</p>
<p>"Is that where you got your idea?"</p>
<p>"That is where I got it."</p>
<p>"It taught those people a valuable lesson."</p>
<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't I? You seem to think it taught <lb/>
you one."</p>
<p>"That is nothing to the point. I am not a <lb/>
fool."</p>
<p>"I see. Were they fools?"</p>
<p>"They were human beings."</p>
<p>"Is it the same thing?"</p>
<p>"Why do you ask? You know it yourself. As <lb/>
regards his health&#x2014;and the rest of the things&#x2014; <lb/>
the average man is what his environment and his <lb/>
superstitions have made him; and their function is <lb/>
to make him an ass. He can't add up three or four <lb/>
new circumstances together and perceive what they <lb/>
mean; it is beyond him. He is not capable of <lb/>
observing for himself. He has to get everything <lb/>
at second-hand. If what are miscalled the lower <lb/>
animals were as silly as man is, they would all perish <lb/>
from the earth in a year."</p>
<p>"Those passengers learned no lesson, then?"</p>
<p>"Not a sign of it. They went to their regular <lb/>
meals in the English ship, and pretty soon they were <lb/>
nibbling again&#x2014;nibbling, appetiteless, disgusted <lb/>
with the food, moody, miserable, half hungry, their <lb/>
outraged stomachs cursing and swearing and whining <lb/>
<pb n="305"/>
and supplicating all day long. And in vain, for they <lb/>
were the stomachs of fools."</p>
<p>"Then as I understand it, your scheme is&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Quite simple. Don't eat till you are hungry. <lb/>
If the food fails to taste good, fails to satisfy you, <lb/>
rejoice you, comfort you, don't eat again until <lb/>
you are <i>very</i> hungry. Then it will rejoice you&#x2014; <lb/>
and do you good, too."</p>
<p>"And I observe no regularity, as to hours?"</p>
<p>"When you are conquering a bad appetite&#x2014;no. <lb/>
After it is conquered, regularity is no harm, so long <lb/>
as the appetite remains good. As soon as the <lb/>
appetite wavers, apply the corrective again&#x2014;which <lb/>
is starvation, long or short according to the needs of <lb/>
the case."</p>
<p>"The best diet, I suppose&#x2014;I mean the whole- <lb/>
somest<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>"</p>
<p>"All diets are wholesome. Some are wholesomer <lb/>
than others, but all the ordinary diets are wholesome <lb/>
enough for the people who use them. Whether the <lb/>
food be fine or coarse, it will taste good and it will <lb/>
nourish if a watch be kept upon the appetite and a <lb/>
little starvation introduced every time it weakens. <lb/>
Nansen was used to fine fare, but when his meals <lb/>
were restricted to bear-meat months at a time he <lb/>
suffered no damage and no discomfort, because his <lb/>
appetite was kept at par through the difficulty of <lb/>
getting his bear-meat regularly."</p>
<p>"But doctors arrange carefully considered and <lb/>
delicate diets for invalids."</p>
<pb n="306"/>
<p>"They can't help it. The invalid is full of in- <lb/>
herited superstitions and won't starve himself. He <lb/>
believes it would certainly kill him."</p>
<p>"It would weaken him, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"Nothing to hurt. Look at the invalids in our <lb/>
shipwreck. They lived fifteen days on pinches of <lb/>
raw ham, a suck at sailor-boots, and general <lb/>
starvation. It weakened them, but it didn't hurt <lb/>
them. It put them in fine shape to eat heartily of <lb/>
hearty food and build themselves up to a condition <lb/>
of robust health. But they did not perceive that; <lb/>
they lost their opportunity; they remained invalids; <lb/>
it served them right. Do you know the tricks that <lb/>
the health-resort doctors play?"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"My system disguised&#x2014;covert starvation. <lb/>
Grape-cure, bath-cure, mud-cure&#x2014;it is all the same. <lb/>
The grape and the bath and the mud make a show <lb/>
and do a trifle of the work&#x2014;the real work is done <lb/>
by the surreptitious starvation. The patient ac- <lb/>
customed to four meals and late hours&#x2014;at both <lb/>
ends of the day&#x2014;now consider what he has to do <lb/>
at a health resort. He gets up at 6 in the morning. <lb/>
Eats one egg. Tramps up and down a promenade <lb/>
two hours with the other fools. Eats a butterfly. <lb/>
Slowly drinks a glass of filtered sewage that smells <lb/>
like a buzzard's breath. Promenades another two <lb/>
hours, but alone; if you speak to him he says <lb/>
anxiously, 'My water!&#x2014;I am walking off my <lb/>
water!&#x2014;please don't interrupt,' and goes stumping <lb/>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>HE EATS A BUTTERFLY</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="307"/>
along again. Eats a candied rose-leaf. Lies at rest <lb/>
in the silence and solitude of his room for hours; <lb/>
mustn't speak, mustn't read, mustn't smoke. The <lb/>
doctor comes and feels of his heart, now, and his <lb/>
pulse, and thumps his breast and his back and his <lb/>
stomach, and listens for results through a penny <lb/>
flageolet; then orders the man's bath&#x2014;half a degree, <lb/>
R&#x00E9;aumur, cooler than yesterday. After the bath, <lb/>
another egg. A glass of sewage at 3 or 4 in the <lb/>
afternoon, and promenade solemnly with the other <lb/>
freaks. Dinner at 6&#x2014;half a doughnut and a cup <lb/>
of tea. Walk again. Half-past 8, supper&#x2014;more <lb/>
butterfly; at 9, to bed. Six weeks of this r&#x00E9;gime <lb/>
&#x2014;think of it. It starves a man out and puts him in <lb/>
splendid condition. It would have the same effect <lb/>
in London, New York, Jericho&#x2014;anywhere."</p>
<p>"How long does it take to put a person in con- <lb/>
dition here?"</p>
<p>"It ought to take but a day or two; but in fact <lb/>
it takes from one to six weeks, according to the <lb/>
character and mentality of the patient."</p>
<p>"How is that?"</p>
<p>"Do you see that crowd of women playing foot- <lb/>
ball, and boxing, and jumping fences yonder? They <lb/>
have been here six or seven weeks. They were <lb/>
spectral poor weaklings when they came. They <lb/>
were accustomed to nibbling at dainties and delicacies <lb/>
at set hours four times a day, and they had no <lb/>
appetite for anything. I questioned them, and then <lb/>
locked them into their rooms, the frailest ones to <lb/>
<pb n="308"/>
starve nine or ten hours, the others twelve or fifteen. <lb/>
Before long they began to beg; and indeed they <lb/>
suffered a good deal. They complained of nausea, <lb/>
headache, and so on. It was good to see them eat <lb/>
when the time was up. They could not remember <lb/>
when the devouring of a meal had afforded them <lb/>
such rapture&#x2014;that was their word. Now, then, <lb/>
that ought to have ended their cure, but it didn't. <lb/>
They were free to go to any meals in the house, and <lb/>
they chose their accustomed four. Within a day or <lb/>
two I had to interfere. Their appetites were <lb/>
weakening. I made them knock out a meal. That <lb/>
set them up again. Then they resumed the four. I <lb/>
begged them to learn to knock out a meal themselves, <lb/>
without waiting for me. Up to a fortnight ago they <lb/>
couldn't; they really hadn't manhood enough; but <lb/>
they were gaining it, and now I think they are safe. <lb/>
They drop out a meal every now and then of their <lb/>
own accord. They are in fine condition now, and <lb/>
they might safely go home, I think, but their con- <lb/>
fidence is not quite perfect yet, so they are waiting <lb/>
awhile."</p>
<p>"Other cases are different?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Sometimes a man learns the whole <lb/>
trick in a week. Learns to regulate his appetite and <lb/>
keep it in perfect order. Learns to drop out a meal <lb/>
with frequency and not mind it."</p>
<p>"But why drop the entire meal out? Why not a <lb/>
part of it?"</p>
<p>"It's a poor device, and inadequate. If the <lb/>
<pb n="309"/>
stomach doesn't call vigorously&#x2014;with a shout, as <lb/>
you may say&#x2014;it is better not to pester it but just <lb/>
give it a real rest. Some people can eat more meals <lb/>
than others, and still thrive. There are all sorts of <lb/>
people, and all sorts of appetites. I will show you <lb/>
a man presently who was accustomed to nibble at <lb/>
eight meals a day. It was beyond the proper gait <lb/>
of his appetite by two. I have got him down to <lb/>
six a day, now, and he is all right, and enjoys life. <lb/>
How many meals do you effect per day?"</p>
<p>"Formerly&#x2014;for twenty-two years&#x2014;a meal and <lb/>
a half; during the past two years, two and a half: <lb/>
coffee and a roll at 9, luncheon at 1, dinner at 7:30 <lb/>
or 8."</p>
<p>"Formerly a meal and a half&#x2014;that is, coffee <lb/>
and a roll at 9, dinner in the evening, nothing <lb/>
between&#x2014;is that it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why did you add a meal?"</p>
<p>"It was the family's idea. They were uneasy. <lb/>
They thought I was killing myself."</p>
<p>"You found a meal and a half per day enough, <lb/>
all through the twenty-two years?"</p>
<p>"Plenty."</p>
<p>"Your present poor condition is due to the extra <lb/>
meal. Drop it out. You are trying to eat oftener <lb/>
than your stomach demands. You don't gain, you <lb/>
lose. You eat less food now, in a day, on two and <lb/>
a half meals, than you formerly ate on one and a <lb/>
half."</p>
<pb n="310"/>
<p>"True&#x2014;a good deal less; for in those old days <lb/>
my dinner was a very sizable thing."</p>
<p>"Put yourself on a single meal a day, now&#x2014; <lb/>
dinner&#x2014;for a few days, till you secure a good, <lb/>
sound, regular, trustworthy appetite, then take to <lb/>
your one and a half permanently, and don't listen to <lb/>
the family any more. When you have any ordinary <lb/>
ailment, particularly of a feverish sort, eat nothing <lb/>
at all during twenty-four hours. That will cure it. <lb/>
It will cure the stubbornest cold in the head, too. <lb/>
No cold in the head can survive twenty-four hours <lb/>
on modified starvation."</p>
<p>"I know it. I have proved it many a time."</p>

<head><b>MARK TWAIN <lb/>
A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH</b></head>
<byline><smcap>By</smcap> SAMUEL E. MOFFETT</byline>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> 1835 the creation of the Western empire of <lb/>
America had just begun. In the whole region <lb/>
west of the Mississippi, which now contains 21,- <lb/>
000,000 people&#x2014;nearly twice the entire popula- <lb/>
tion of the United States at that time&#x2014;there were <lb/>
less than half a million white inhabitants. There <lb/>
were only two states beyond the great river, Loui- <lb/>
siana and Missouri. There were only two con- <lb/>
siderable groups of population, one about New <lb/>
Orleans, the other about St. Louis. If we omit <lb/>
New Orleans, which is east of the river, there was <lb/>
only one place in all that vast domain with any <lb/>
pretension to be called a city. That was St. <lb/>
Louis, and that metropolis, the wonder and pride <lb/>
of all the Western country, had no more than <lb/>
10,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>It was in this frontier region, on the extreme fringe <lb/>
of settlement "that just divides the desert from the <lb/>
sown," that Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born, <lb/>
November 30, 1835, in the hamlet of Florida, Mis- <lb/>
souri. His parents had come there to be in the <lb/>
<pb n="315"/>
thick of the Western boom, and by a fate for <lb/>
which no lack of foresight on their part was to <lb/>
blame, they found themselves in a place which <lb/>
succeeded in accumulating 125 inhabitants in the <lb/>
next sixty years. When we read of the west- <lb/>
ward sweep of population and wealth in the United <lb/>
States, it seems as if those who were in the van <lb/>
of that movement must have been inevitably car- <lb/>
ried on to fortune. But that was a tide full of <lb/>
eddies and back currents, and Mark Twain's parents <lb/>
possessed a faculty for finding them that appears <lb/>
nothing less than miraculous. The whole Western <lb/>
empire was before them where to choose. They <lb/>
could have bought the entire site of Chicago for a <lb/>
pair of boots. They could have taken up a farm <lb/>
within the present city limits of St. Louis. What <lb/>
they actually did was to live for a time in Columbia, <lb/>
Kentucky, with a small property in land, and six <lb/>
inherited slaves, then to move to Jamestown, on the <lb/>
Cumberland plateau of Tennessee, a place that was <lb/>
then no farther removed from the currents of the <lb/>
world's life than Uganda, but which no resident of <lb/>
that or any other part of Central Africa would now <lb/>
regard as a serious competitor, and next to migrate <lb/>
to Missouri, passing St. Louis and settling first in <lb/>
Florida, and afterward in Hannibal. But when the <lb/>
whole map was blank the promise of fortune glowed <lb/>
as rosily in these regions as anywhere else. Florida <lb/>
had great expectations when Jackson was President. <lb/>
When John Marshall Clemens took up 80,000 acres <lb/>
<pb n="316"/>
of land in Tennessee, he thought he had established <lb/>
his children as territorial magnates. That phantom <lb/>
vision of wealth furnished later one of the motives <lb/>
of "The Gilded Age." It conferred no other <lb/>
benefit.</p>
<p>If Samuel Clemens missed a fortune he inherited <lb/>
good blood. On both sides his family had been <lb/>
settled in the South since early colonial times. His <lb/>
father, John Marshall Clemens, of Virginia, was a <lb/>
descendant of Gregory Clemens, who became one of <lb/>
the judges that condemned Charles I. to death, was <lb/>
excepted from the amnesty after the Restoration in <lb/>
consequence, and lost his head. A cousin of John <lb/>
M. Clemens, Jeremiah Clemens, represented Alabama <lb/>
in the United States Senate from 1849 to 1853.</p>
<p>Through his mother, Jane Lampton (Lambton), <lb/>
the boy was descended from the Lambtons of Dur- <lb/>
ham, whose modern English representatives still <lb/>
possess the lands held by their ancestors of the same <lb/>
name since the twelfth century. Some of her for- <lb/>
bears on the maternal side, the Montgomerys, went <lb/>
with Daniel Boone to Kentucky, and were in the thick <lb/>
of the romantic and tragic events that accompanied <lb/>
the settlement of the "Dark and Bloody Ground," <lb/>
and she herself was born there twenty-nine years after <lb/>
the first log cabin was built within the limits of the <lb/>
present commonwealth. She was one of the earliest, <lb/>
prettiest, and brightest of the many belles that have <lb/>
given Kentucky such an enviable reputation as a <lb/>
nursery of fair women, and her vivacity and wit left <lb/>
<pb n="317"/>
no doubt in the minds of her friends concerning the <lb/>
source of her son's genius.</p>
<p>John Marshall Clemens, who had been trained for <lb/>
the bar in Virginia, served for some years as a mag- <lb/>
istrate at Hannibal, holding for a time the position <lb/>
of county judge. With his death, in March, 1847, <lb/>
Mark Twain's formal education came to an end, and <lb/>
his education in real life began. He had always been <lb/>
a delicate boy, and his father, in consequence, had <lb/>
been lenient in the matter of enforcing attendance at <lb/>
school, although he had been profoundly anxious <lb/>
that his children should be well educated. His wish <lb/>
was fulfilled, although not in the way he had expected. <lb/>
It is a fortunate thing for literature that Mark Twain <lb/>
was never ground into smooth uniformity under the <lb/>
scholastic emery wheel. He has made the world his <lb/>
university, and in men, and books, and strange places, <lb/>
and all the phases of an infinitely varied life, has <lb/>
built an education broad and deep, on the foundations <lb/>
of an undisturbed individuality.</p>
<p>His high school was a village printing-office, where <lb/>
his elder brother Orion was conducting a newspaper. <lb/>
The thirteen-year-old boy served in all capacities, <lb/>
and in the occasional absences of his chief he reveled <lb/>
in personal journalism, with original illustrations <lb/>
hacked on wooden blocks with a jackknife, to an <lb/>
extent that riveted the town's attention, "but not its <lb/>
admiration," as his brother plaintively confessed. <lb/>
The editor spoke with feeling, for he had to take the <lb/>
consequences of these exploits on his return.</p>
<pb n="318"/>
<p>From his earliest childhood young Clemens had <lb/>
been of an adventurous disposition. Before he was <lb/>
thirteen, he had been extracted three times from the <lb/>
Mississippi, and six times from Bear Creek, in a sub- <lb/>
stantially drowned condition, but his mother, with <lb/>
the high confidence in his future that never deserted <lb/>
her, merely remarked: "People who are born to be <lb/>
hanged are safe in the water." By 1853 the Han- <lb/>
nibal tether had become too short for him. He <lb/>
disappeared from home and wandered from one <lb/>
Eastern printing-office to another. He saw the <lb/>
World's Fair at New York, and other marvels, <lb/>
and supported himself by setting type. At the <lb/>
end of this <i>Wanderjahr</i> financial stress drove him <lb/>
back to his family. He lived at St. Louis, Mus- <lb/>
catine, and Keokuk until 1857, when he induced <lb/>
the great Horace Bixby to teach him the mystery <lb/>
of steamboat piloting. The charm of all this <lb/>
warm, indolent existence in the sleepy river towns <lb/>
has colored his whole subsequent life. In "Tom <lb/>
Sawyer," "Huckleberry Finn," "Life on the <lb/>
Mississippi," and "Pudd'nhead Wilson," every <lb/>
phase of that vanished estate is lovingly dwelt upon.</p>
<p>Native character will always make itself felt, but <lb/>
one may wonder whether Mark Twain's humor would <lb/>
have developed in quite so sympathetic and buoyant <lb/>
a vein if he had been brought up in Ecclefechan <lb/>
instead of in Hannibal, and whether Carlyle might <lb/>
not have been a little more human if he had spent his <lb/>
boyhood in Hannibal instead of in Ecclefechan.</p>
<pb n="319"/>
<p>A Mississippi pilot in the later fifties was a <lb/>
personage of imposing grandeur. He was a miracle <lb/>
of attainments; he was the absolute master of his <lb/>
boat while it was under way, and just before his <lb/>
fall he commanded a salary precisely equal to that <lb/>
earned at that time by the Vice-President of the <lb/>
United States or a Justice of the Supreme Court. <lb/>
The best proof of the superlative majesty and desira- <lb/>
bility of his position is the fact that Samuel Clemens <lb/>
deliberately subjected himself to the incredible labor <lb/>
necessary to attain it&#x2014;a labor compared with which <lb/>
the efforts needed to acquire the degree of Doctor of <lb/>
Philosophy at a University are as light as a sum- <lb/>
mer course of modern novels. To appreciate the <lb/>
full meaning of a pilot's marvelous education, one <lb/>
must read the whole of "Life on the Mississippi," <lb/>
but this extract may give a partial idea of a <lb/>
single feature of that training&#x2014;the cultivation of <lb/>
the memory:</p>
<p>"First of all, there is one faculty which a pilot <lb/>
must incessantly cultivate until he has brought it to <lb/>
absolute perfection. Nothing short of perfection <lb/>
will do. That faculty is memory. He cannot stop <lb/>
with merely thinking a thing is so and so; he must <lb/>
<i>know</i> it; for this is eminently one of the exact sci- <lb/>
ences. With what scorn a pilot was looked upon, in <lb/>
the old times, if he ever ventured to deal in that <lb/>
feeble phrase 'I think,' instead of the vigorous one <lb/>
'I know!' One cannot easily realize what a tre- <lb/>
mendous thing it is to know every trivial detail of <lb/>
<pb n="320"/>
twelve hundred miles of river, and know it with <lb/>
absolute exactness. If you will take the longest <lb/>
street in New York, and travel up and down it, <lb/>
conning its features patiently until you know every <lb/>
house, and window, and door, and lamp-post, and <lb/>
big and little sign by heart, and know them so <lb/>
accurately that you can instantly name the one <lb/>
you are abreast of when you are set down at <lb/>
random in that street in the middle of an inky <lb/>
black night, you will then have a tolerable notion <lb/>
of the amount and the exactness of a pilot's knowl- <lb/>
edge who carries the Mississippi River in his head. <lb/>
And then, if you will go on until you know every <lb/>
street crossing, the character, size, and position of <lb/>
the crossing-stones, and the varying depth of mud <lb/>
in each of those numberless places, you will have <lb/>
some idea of what the pilot must know in order to <lb/>
keep a Mississippi steamer out of trouble. Next, if <lb/>
you will take half of the signs in that long street and <lb/>
<i>change their places</i> once a month, and still manage to <lb/>
know their new positions accurately on dark nights, <lb/>
and keep up with these repeated changes without <lb/>
making any mistakes, you will understand what is <lb/>
required of a pilot's peerless memory by the fickle <lb/>
Mississippi.</p>
<p>"I think a pilot's memory is about the most <lb/>
wonderful thing in the world. To know the Old <lb/>
and New Testaments by heart, and be able to recite <lb/>
them glibly, forward or backward, or begin at random <lb/>
anywhere in the book and recite both ways, and <lb/>
<pb n="321"/>
never trip or make a mistake, is no extravagant mass <lb/>
of knowledge, and no marvelous facility, compared <lb/>
to a pilot's massed knowledge of the Mississippi, and <lb/>
his marvelous facility in handling it&#x2026;</p>
<p>"And how easily and comfortably the pilot's mem- <lb/>
ory does its work; how placidly effortless is its way; <lb/>
how <i>unconsciously</i> it lays up its vast stores, hour by <lb/>
hour, day by day, and never loses or mislays a single <lb/>
valuable package of them all! Take an instance. <lb/>
Let a leadsman say: 'Half twain! half twain! half <lb/>
twain! half twain! half twain!' until it becomes as <lb/>
monotonous as the ticking of a clock; let con- <lb/>
versation be going on all the time, and the pilot be <lb/>
doing his share of the talking, and no longer con- <lb/>
sciously listening to the leadsman; and in the midst <lb/>
of this endless string of half twains let a single <lb/>
'quarter twain!' be interjected, without emphasis, <lb/>
and then the half twain cry go on again, just as <lb/>
before: two or three weeks later that pilot can <lb/>
describe with precision the boat's position in the river <lb/>
when that quarter twain was uttered, and give you <lb/>
such a lot of head marks, stern marks, and side marks <lb/>
to guide you that you ought to be able to take the <lb/>
boat there and put her in that same spot again your- <lb/>
self! The cry of 'Quarter twain' did not really <lb/>
take his mind from his talk, but his trained faculties <lb/>
instantly photographed the bearings, noted the change <lb/>
of depth, and laid up the important details for future <lb/>
reference without requiring any assistance from him <lb/>
in the matter."</p>
<pb n="322"/>
<p>Young Clemens went through all that appalling <lb/>
training, stored away in his head the bewildering mass <lb/>
of knowledge a pilot's duties required, received the <lb/>
license that was the diploma of the river university, <lb/>
entered into regular employment, and regarded him- <lb/>
self as established for life, when the outbreak of the <lb/>
Civil War wiped out his occupation at a stroke, and <lb/>
made his weary apprenticeship a useless labor. The <lb/>
commercial navigation of the lower Mississippi was <lb/>
stopped by a line of fire, and black, squat gunboats, <lb/>
their sloping sides plated with railroad iron, took the <lb/>
place of the gorgeous white side-wheelers, whose <lb/>
pilots had been the envied aristocrats of the river <lb/>
towns. Clemens was in New Orleans when Louisiana <lb/>
seceded, and started North the next day. The boat <lb/>
ran a blockade every day of her trip, and on the last <lb/>
night of the voyage the batteries at the Jefferson <lb/>
barracks, just below St. Louis, fired two shots through <lb/>
her chimneys.</p>
<p>Brought up in a slaveholding atmosphere, Mark <lb/>
Twain naturally sympathized at first with the South. <lb/>
In June he joined the Confederates in Ralls County, <lb/>
Missouri, as a Second Lieutenant under General Tom <lb/>
Harris. His military career lasted for two weeks. <lb/>
Narrowly missing the distinction of being captured <lb/>
by Colonel Ulysses S. Grant, he resigned, explaining <lb/>
that he had become "incapacitated by fatigue" <lb/>
through persistent retreating. In his subsequent <lb/>
writings he has always treated his brief experience of <lb/>
warfare as a burlesque episode, although the official <lb/>
<pb n="323"/>
reports and correspondence of the Confederate com- <lb/>
manders speak very respectfully of the work of the <lb/>
raw countrymen of the Harris Brigade. The elder <lb/>
Clemens brother, Orion, was <i>persona grata</i> to the <lb/>
Administration of President Lincoln, and received in <lb/>
consequence an appointment as the first Secretary of <lb/>
the new Territory of Nevada. He offered his speedily <lb/>
reconstructed junior the position of private secretary <lb/>
to himself, "with nothing to do and no salary." <lb/>
The two crossed the plains in the overland coach in <lb/>
eighteen days&#x2014;almost precisely the time it will take <lb/>
to go from New York to Vladivostok when the <lb/>
Trans-Siberian Railway is finished.</p>
<p>A year of variegated fortune hunting among the <lb/>
silver mines of the Humboldt and Esmeralda regions <lb/>
followed. Occasional letters written during this time <lb/>
to the leading newspaper of the Territory, the Virginia <lb/>
City <i>Territorial Enterprise</i>, attracted the attention <lb/>
of the proprietor, Mr. J. T. Goodman, a man of <lb/>
keen and unerring literary instinct, and he offered <lb/>
the writer the position of local editor on his staff. <lb/>
With the duties of this place were combined those <lb/>
of legislative correspondent at Carson City, the <lb/>
capital. The work of young Clemens created a sen- <lb/>
sation among the lawmakers. He wrote a weekly <lb/>
letter, spined with barbed personalities. It ap- <lb/>
peared every Sunday, and on Mondays the legis- <lb/>
lative business was obstructed with the complaints of <lb/>
members who rose to questions of privilege, and ex- <lb/>
pressed their opinion of the correspondent with <lb/>
<pb n="324"/>
acerbity. This encouraged him to give his letters <lb/>
more individuality by signing them. For this pur- <lb/>
pose he adopted the old Mississippi leadsman's call <lb/>
for two fathoms (twelve feet)&#x2014;"Mark Twain."</p>
<p>At that particular period dueling was a passing <lb/>
fashion on the Comstock. The refinements of <lb/>
Parisian civilization had not penetrated there, and a <lb/>
Washoe duel seldom left more than one survivor. <lb/>
The weapons were always Colt's navy revolvers&#x2014; <lb/>
distance, fifteen paces; fire and advance; six shots <lb/>
allowed. Mark Twain became involved in a quarrel <lb/>
with Mr. Laird, the editor of the Virginia <i>Union</i>, and <lb/>
the situation seemed to call for a duel. Neither <lb/>
combatant was an expert with the pistol, but Mark <lb/>
Twain was fortunate enough to have a second who <lb/>
was. The men were practicing in adjacent gorges, <lb/>
Mr. Laird doing fairly well, and his opponent hitting <lb/>
everything but the mark. A small bird lit on a sage <lb/>
bush thirty yards away, and Mark Twain's second <lb/>
fired and knocked off its head. At that moment the <lb/>
enemy came over the ridge, saw the dead bird, <lb/>
observed the distance, and learned from Gillis, the <lb/>
humorist's second, that the feat had been performed <lb/>
by Mark Twain, for whom such an exploit was <lb/>
nothing remarkable. They withdrew for consulta- <lb/>
tion, and then offered a formal apology, after which <lb/>
peace was restored, leaving Mark Twain with the <lb/>
honors of war.</p>
<p>However, this incident was the means of effecting <lb/>
another change in his life. There was a new law <lb/>
<pb n="325"/>
which prescribed two years' imprisonment for any <lb/>
one who should send, carry, or accept a challenge. <lb/>
The fame of the proposed duel had reached the <lb/>
capital, eighteen miles away, and the governor <lb/>
wrathfully gave orders for the arrest of all concerned, <lb/>
announcing his intention of making an example that <lb/>
would be remembered. A friend of the duelists <lb/>
heard of their danger, outrode the officers of the <lb/>
law, and hurried the parties over the border into <lb/>
California.</p>
<p>Mark Twain found a berth as city editor of the San <lb/>
Francisco <i>Morning Call</i>, but he was not adapted to <lb/>
routine newspaper work, and in a couple of years he <lb/>
made another bid for fortune in the mines. He tried <lb/>
the "pocket mines" of California, this time, at <lb/>
Jackass Gulch, in Calaveras County, but was fortunate <lb/>
enough to find no pockets. Thus he escaped the <lb/>
hypnotic fascination that has kept some intermittently <lb/>
successful pocket miners willing prisoners in Sierra <lb/>
cabins for life, and in three months he was back in <lb/>
San Francisco, penniless, but in the line of literary <lb/>
promotion. He wrote letters for the Virginia <i>Enter- <lb/>
prise</i> for a time, but tiring of that, welcomed an <lb/>
assignment to visit Hawaii for the Sacramento <i>Union</i>, <lb/>
and write about the sugar interests. It was in <lb/>
Honolulu that he accomplished one of his greatest <lb/>
feats of "straight newspaper work." The clipper <lb/>
<i>Hornet</i> had been burned on "the line," and when <lb/>
the skeleton survivors arrived, after a passage of <lb/>
forty-three days in an open boat on ten days' pro- <lb/>
<pb n="326"/>
visions, Mark Twain gathered their stories, worked <lb/>
all day and all night, and threw a complete account <lb/>
of the horror aboard a schooner that had already <lb/>
cast off. It was the only full account that reached <lb/>
California, and it was not only a clean "scoop" of <lb/>
unusual magnitude, but an admirable piece of literary <lb/>
art. The <i>Union</i> testified its appreciation by paying <lb/>
the correspondent ten times the current rates for it.</p>
<p>After six months in the Islands, Mark Twain re- <lb/>
turned to California, and made his first venture upon <lb/>
the lecture platform. He was warmly received, and <lb/>
delivered several lectures with profit. In 1867 he <lb/>
went East by way of the Isthmus, and joined the <lb/>
Quaker City excursion to Europe and the Holy Land, <lb/>
as correspondent of the <i>Alta California</i>, of San <lb/>
Francisco. During this tour of five or six months <lb/>
the party visited the principal ports of the Mediter- <lb/>
ranean and the Black Sea. From this trip grew <lb/>
"The Innocents Abroad," the creator of Mark <lb/>
Twain's reputation as a literary force of the first <lb/>
order. "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras <lb/>
County" had preceded it, but "The Innocents" <lb/>
gave the author his first introduction to international <lb/>
literature. A hundred thousand copies were sold <lb/>
the first year, and as many more later.</p>
<p>Four years of lecturing followed&#x2014;distasteful, but <lb/>
profitable. Mark Twain always shrank from the <lb/>
public exhibition of himself on the platform, but he <lb/>
was a popular favorite there from the first. He was <lb/>
one of a little group, including Henry Ward Beecher <lb/>
<pb n="327"/>
and two or three others, for whom every lyceum com- <lb/>
mittee in the country was bidding, and whose capture <lb/>
at any price insured the success of a lecture course.</p>
<p>The Quaker City excursion had a more important <lb/>
result than the production of "The Innocents <lb/>
Abroad." Through her brother, who was one of <lb/>
the party, Mr. Clemens became acquainted with <lb/>
Miss Olivia L. Langdon, the daughter of Jervis <lb/>
Langdon, of Elmira, New York, and this acquaint- <lb/>
ance led, in February, 1870, to one of the most ideal <lb/>
marriages in literary history.</p>
<p>Four children came of this union. The eldest, <lb/>
Langdon, a son, was born in November, 1870, and <lb/>
died in 1872. The second, Susan Olivia, a daughter, <lb/>
was born in the latter year, and lived only twenty- <lb/>
four years, but long enough to develop extraordinary <lb/>
mental gifts and every grace of character. Two <lb/>
other daughters, Clara Langdon and Jean, were born <lb/>
in 1874 and 1880, respectively, and still live (1899).</p>
<p>Mark Twain's first home as a man of family was <lb/>
in Buffalo, in a house given to the bride by her father <lb/>
as a wedding present. He bought a third interest <lb/>
in a daily newspaper, the Buffalo <i>Express</i>, and <lb/>
joined its staff. But his time for jogging in harness <lb/>
was past. It was his last attempt at regular news- <lb/>
paper work, and a year of it was enough. He had <lb/>
become assured of a market for anything he might <lb/>
produce, and he could choose his own place and <lb/>
time for writing.</p>
<p>There was a tempting literary colony at Hartford; <lb/>
<pb n="328"/>
the place was steeped in an atmosphere of antique <lb/>
peace and beauty, and the Clemens family were <lb/>
captivated by its charm. They moved there in <lb/>
October, 1871, and soon built a house which was <lb/>
one of the earliest fruits of the artistic revolt against <lb/>
the mid-century Philistinism of domestic architecture <lb/>
in America. For years it was an object of wonder <lb/>
to the simple-minded tourist. The facts that its <lb/>
rooms were arranged for the convenience of those <lb/>
who were to occupy them, and that its windows, <lb/>
gables, and porches were distributed with an eye to <lb/>
the beauty, comfort, and picturesqueness of that <lb/>
particular house, instead of following the traditional <lb/>
lines laid down by the carpenters and contractors <lb/>
who designed most of the dwellings of the period, <lb/>
distracted the critics, and gave rise to grave dis- <lb/>
cussions in the newspapers throughout the country <lb/>
of "Mark Twain's practical joke."</p>
<p>The years that followed brought a steady literary <lb/>
development. "Roughing It," which was written <lb/>
in 1872, and scored a success hardly second to that <lb/>
of "The Innocents," was, like that, simply a <lb/>
humorous narrative of personal experiences, varie- <lb/>
gated by brilliant splashes of description; but with <lb/>
"The Gilded Age," which was produced in the same <lb/>
year, in collaboration with Mr. Charles Dudley <lb/>
Warner, the humorist began to evolve into the <lb/>
philosopher. "Tom Sawyer," appearing in 1876, <lb/>
was a veritable manual of boy nature, and its sequel, <lb/>
"Huckleberry Finn," which was published nine years <lb/>
<pb n="329"/>
later, was not only an advanced treatise in the same <lb/>
science, but a most moving study of the workings <lb/>
of the untutored human soul, in boy and man. <lb/>
"The Prince and the Pauper," 1882, "A Connecti- <lb/>
cut Yankee at King Arthur's Court" (1890), and <lb/>
"Pudd'nhead Wilson" (first published serially in <lb/>
1893-94), were all alive with a comprehensive and <lb/>
passionate sympathy to which their humor was quite <lb/>
subordinate, although Mark Twain never wrote, and <lb/>
probably never will write, a book that could be read <lb/>
without laughter. His humor is as irrepressible as <lb/>
Lincoln's, and like that, it bubbles out on the most <lb/>
solemn occasions; but still, again like Lincoln's, it <lb/>
has a way of seeming, in spite of the surface in- <lb/>
congruity, to belong there. But it was in the <lb/>
"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc," whose <lb/>
anonymous serial publication in 1894-95 betrayed <lb/>
some critics of reputation into the absurdity of <lb/>
attributing it to other authors, notwithstanding the <lb/>
characteristic evidences of its paternity that obtruded <lb/>
themselves on every page, that Mark Twain became <lb/>
most distinctly a prophet of humanity. Here, at <lb/>
last, was a book with nothing ephemeral about it&#x2014; <lb/>
one that will reach the elemental human heart as well <lb/>
among the flying machines of the next century, as it <lb/>
does among the automobiles of to-day, or as it would <lb/>
have done among the stage coaches of a hundred <lb/>
years ago.</p>
<p>And side by side with this spiritual growth had <lb/>
come a growth in knowledge and in culture. The <lb/>
<pb n="330"/>
Mark Twain of "The Innocents," keen-eyed, quick <lb/>
of understanding, and full of fresh, eager interest in <lb/>
all Europe had to show, but frankly avowing that he <lb/>
"did not know what in the mischief the Renaissance <lb/>
was," had developed into an accomplished scholar <lb/>
and a man of the world for whom the globe had few <lb/>
surprises left. The Mark Twain of 1895 might con- <lb/>
ceivably have written "The Innocents Abroad," <lb/>
although it would have required an effort to put him- <lb/>
self in the necessary frame of mind, but the Mark <lb/>
Twain of 1869 could no more have written "Joan <lb/>
of Arc" than he could have deciphered the Maya <lb/>
hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>In 1873 the family spent some months in England <lb/>
and Scotland, and Mr. Clemens lectured for a few <lb/>
weeks in London. Another European journey <lb/>
followed in 1878.</p>
<p>"A Tramp Abroad" was the result of this <lb/>
tour, which lasted eighteen months. "The Prince <lb/>
and the Pauper," "Life on the Mississippi," and <lb/>
"Huckleberry Finn" appeared in quick succes- <lb/>
sion in 1882, 1883, and 1885. Considerably more <lb/>
amusing than anything the humorist ever wrote was <lb/>
the fact that the trustees of some village libraries in <lb/>
New England solemnly voted that "Huckleberry <lb/>
Finn," whose power of moral uplift has hardly been <lb/>
surpassed by any book of our time, was too demoral- <lb/>
izing to be allowed on their shelves.</p>
<p>All this time fortune had been steadily favorable, <lb/>
and Mark Twain had been spoken of by the press, <lb/>
<pb n="331"/>
sometimes with admiration, as an example of the <lb/>
financial success possible in literature, and sometimes <lb/>
with uncharitable envy, as a haughty millionaire, <lb/>
forgetful of his humble friends. But now began the <lb/>
series of unfortunate investments that swept away <lb/>
the accumulations of half a lifetime of hard work, <lb/>
and left him loaded with debts incurred by other <lb/>
men. In 1885 he financed the publishing house of <lb/>
Charles L. Webster &amp; Company in New York. The <lb/>
firm began business with the prestige of a brilliant <lb/>
<i>coup</i>. It secured the publication of the Memoirs <lb/>
of General Grant, which achieved a sale of more <lb/>
than 600,000 volumes. The first check received <lb/>
by the Grant heirs was for &#x0024;200,000, and this was <lb/>
followed a few months later by one for &#x0024;150,000. <lb/>
These are the largest checks ever paid for an author's <lb/>
work on either side of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, <lb/>
Mr. Clemens was spending great sums on a type- <lb/>
setting machine of such seductive ingenuity as to <lb/>
captivate the imagination of everybody who saw it. <lb/>
It worked to perfection, but it was too complicated <lb/>
and expensive for commercial use, and after sinking <lb/>
a fortune in it between 1886 and 1889, Mark Twain <lb/>
had to write off the whole investment as a dead loss.</p>
<p>On top of this the publishing house, which had <lb/>
been supposed to be doing a profitable business, <lb/>
turned out to have been incapably conducted, and <lb/>
all the money that came into its hands was lost. <lb/>
Mark Twain contributed &#x0024;65,000 in efforts to save <lb/>
its life, but to no purpose, and when it finally failed, <lb/>
<pb n="332"/>
he found that it had not only absorbed everything <lb/>
he had put in, but had incurred liabilities of &#x0024;96,000, <lb/>
of which less than one-third was covered by assets.</p>
<p>He could easily have avoided any legal liability for <lb/>
the debts, but as the credit of the company had been <lb/>
based largely upon his name, he felt bound in honor <lb/>
to pay them. In 1895-96 he took his wife and <lb/>
second daughter on a lecturing tour around the <lb/>
world, wrote "Following the Equator," and cleared <lb/>
off the obligations of the house in full.</p>
<p>The years 1897, 1898, and 1899 were spent in <lb/>
England, Switzerland, and Austria. Vienna took <lb/>
the family to its heart, and Mark Twain achieved <lb/>
such a popularity among all classes there as is rarely <lb/>
won by a foreigner anywhere. He saw the manu- <lb/>
facture of a good deal of history in that time. It <lb/>
was his fortune, for instance, to be present in the <lb/>
Austrian Reichsrath on the memorable occasion when <lb/>
it was invaded by sixty policemen, and sixteen <lb/>
refractory members were dragged roughly out of <lb/>
the hall. That momentous event in the progress <lb/>
of parliamentary government profoundly impressed <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>Mark Twain, although so characteristically Amer- <lb/>
ican in every fiber, does not appeal to Americans <lb/>
alone, nor even to the English-speaking race. His <lb/>
work has stood the test of translation into French, <lb/>
German, Russian, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian, and <lb/>
Magyar. That is pretty good evidence that it <lb/>
possesses the universal quality that marks the master. <lb/>
<pb n="333"/>
Another evidence of its fidelity to human nature is <lb/>
the readiness with which it lends itself to dramatiza- <lb/>
tion. "The Gilded Age," "Tom Sawyer," "The <lb/>
Prince and the Pauper," and "Pudd'nhead Wilson" <lb/>
have all been successful on the stage.</p>
<p>In the thirty-eight years of his literary activity <lb/>
Mark Twain has seen generation after generation of <lb/>
"American humorists" rise, expand into sudden <lb/>
popularity, and disappear, leaving hardly a memory <lb/>
behind. If he has not written himself out like them, <lb/>
if his place in literature has become every year more <lb/>
assured, it is because his "humor" has been some- <lb/>
thing radically different from theirs. It has been <lb/>
irresistibly laughter-provoking, but its sole end has <lb/>
never been to make people laugh. Its more im- <lb/>
portant purpose has been to make them think and <lb/>
feel. And with the progress of the years Mark <lb/>
Twain's own thoughts have become finer, his own <lb/>
feelings deeper and more responsive. Sympathy <lb/>
with the suffering, hatred of injustice and oppression, <lb/>
and enthusiasm for all that tends to make the world <lb/>
a more tolerable place for mankind to live in, have <lb/>
grown with his accumulating knowledge of life as it <lb/>
is. That is why Mark Twain has become a classic, <lb/>
not only at home, but in all lands whose people read <lb/>
and think about the common joys and sorrows of <lb/>
humanity.</p>
