<head><smcap>tom seeks new adventures</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Do</smcap> you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all <lb/>
them adventures? I mean the adventures we had <lb/>
down the river, and the time we set the darky Jim free <lb/>
and Tom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn't. It only <lb/>
just p'isoned him for more. That was all the effect it <lb/>
had. You see, when we three came back up the river <lb/>
in glory, as you may say, from that long travel, and <lb/>
the village received us with a torchlight procession and <lb/>
speeches, and everybody hurrah'd and shouted, it <lb/>
made us heroes, and that was what Tom Sawyer had <lb/>
always been hankering to be.</p>
<p>For a while he <i>was</i> satisfied. Everybody made <lb/>
much of him, and he tilted up his nose and stepped <lb/>
around the town as though he owned it. Some called <lb/>
him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled <lb/>
him up fit to bust. You see he laid over me and Jim <lb/>
considerable, because we only went down the river on <lb/>
a raft and came back by the steamboat, but Tom went <lb/>
<pb n="8"/>
by the steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and <lb/>
Jim a good deal, but land! they just knuckled to the <lb/>
dirt before TOM.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know; maybe he might have been <lb/>
satisfied if it hadn't been for old Nat Parsons, which <lb/>
was postmaster, and powerful long and slim, and kind <lb/>
o' good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account <lb/>
of his age, and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. <lb/>
For as much as thirty years he'd been the only man in <lb/>
the village that had a reputation&#x2014;I mean a reputation <lb/>
for being a traveler, and of course he was mortal proud <lb/>
of it, and it was reckoned that in the course of that <lb/>
thirty years he had told about that journey over a <lb/>
million times and enjoyed it every time. And now <lb/>
comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and sets everybody <lb/>
admiring and gawking over <i>his</i> travels, and it just give <lb/>
the poor old man the high strikes. It made him sick <lb/>
to listen to Tom, and to hear the people say "My <lb/>
land!" "Did you ever!" "My goodness sakes <lb/>
alive!" and all such things; but he couldn't pull away <lb/>
from it, any more than a fly that's got its hind leg fast <lb/>
in the molasses. And always when Tom come to a <lb/>
rest, the poor old cretur would chip in on <i>his</i> same old <lb/>
travels and work them for all they were worth; but <lb/>
they were pretty faded, and didn't go for much, and it <lb/>
was pitiful to see. And then Tom would take another <lb/>
innings, and then the old man again&#x2014;and so on, and <lb/>
so on, for an hour and more, each trying to beat out <lb/>
the other.</p>
<p>You see, Parsons' travels happened like this: When <lb/>
<pb n="9"/>
he first got to be postmaster and was green in the busi- <lb/>
ness, there come a letter for somebody he didn't know, <lb/>
and there wasn't any such person in the village. Well, <lb/>
he didn't know what to do, nor how to act, and there <lb/>
the letter stayed and stayed, week in and week out, till <lb/>
the bare sight of it gave him a conniption. The postage <lb/>
wasn't paid on it, and that was another thing to worry <lb/>
about. There wasn't any way to collect that ten cents, <lb/>
and he reckon'd the gov'ment would hold him respon- <lb/>
sible for it and maybe turn him out besides, when they <lb/>
found he hadn't collected it. Well, at last he couldn't <lb/>
stand it any longer. He couldn't sleep nights, he <lb/>
couldn't eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet <lb/>
he da'sn't ask anybody's advice, for the very person <lb/>
he asked for advice might go back on him and let the <lb/>
gov'ment know about the letter. He had the letter <lb/>
buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he <lb/>
happened to see a person standing over the place it'd <lb/>
give him the cold shivers, and loaded him up with <lb/>
suspicions, and he would sit up that night till the town <lb/>
was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and <lb/>
get it out and bury it in another place. Of course, <lb/>
people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads <lb/>
and whispering, because, the way he was looking and <lb/>
acting, they judged he had killed somebody or done <lb/>
something terrible, they didn't know what, and if he <lb/>
had been a stranger they would've lynched him.</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying, it got so he couldn't stand it <lb/>
any longer; so he made up his mind to pull out for <lb/>
Washington, and just go to the President of the United <lb/>
<pb n="10"/>
States and make a clean breast of the whole thing, not <lb/>
keeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and <lb/>
lay it before the whole gov'ment, and say, "Now, <lb/>
there she is&#x2014;do with me what you're a mind to; <lb/>
though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man <lb/>
and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and <lb/>
leaving behind me a family that must starve and yet <lb/>
hadn't had a thing to do with it, which is the whole <lb/>
truth and I can swear to it."</p>
<p>So he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboat- <lb/>
ing, and some stage-coaching, but all the rest of the <lb/>
way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get <lb/>
to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of vil- <lb/>
lages and four cities. He was gone 'most eight weeks, <lb/>
and there never was such a proud man in the village as <lb/>
he when he got back. His travels made him the greatest <lb/>
man in all that region, and the most talked about; and <lb/>
people come from as much as thirty miles back in the <lb/>
country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, <lb/>
just to look at him&#x2014;and there they'd stand and gawk, <lb/>
and he'd gabble. You never see anything like it.</p>
<p>Well, there wasn't any way now to settle which was <lb/>
the greatest traveler; some said it was Nat, some said <lb/>
it was Tom. Everybody allowed that Nat had seen <lb/>
the most longitude, but they had to give in that what- <lb/>
ever Tom was short in longitude he had made up in <lb/>
latitude and climate. It was about a stand-off; so both <lb/>
of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures, <lb/>
and try to get ahead <i>that</i> way. That bullet-wound in <lb/>
Tom's leg was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck</p>
<pb n="11"/>
<gap desc="page 11" reason="missing"/>
<pb n="12"/>
<gap desc="page 12" reason="missing"/>
<pb n="13"/>
<p>had the hack he wouldn't 'a' got there in time, nor <lb/>
anywhere near it.</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer <lb/>
had to work his bullet-wound mighty lively to hold his <lb/>
own against it.</p>
<p>Well, by and by Tom's glory got to paling down <lb/>
gradu'ly, on account of other things turning up for the <lb/>
people to talk about&#x2014;first a horse-race, and on top of <lb/>
that a house afire, and on top of that the circus, and <lb/>
on top of that the eclipse; and that started a revival, <lb/>
same as it always does, and by that time there wasn't <lb/>
any more talk about Tom, so to speak, and you never <lb/>
see a person so sick and disgusted.</p>
<p>Pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right <lb/>
along day in and day out, and when I asked him what <lb/>
<i>was</i> he in such a state about, he said it 'most broke his <lb/>
heart to think how time was slipping away, and him <lb/>
getting older and older, and no wars breaking out and <lb/>
no way of making a name for himself that he could <lb/>
see. Now that is the way boys is always thinking, but <lb/>
he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it <unclear/></p>
<p>So then he set to work to get up <unclear/> <lb/>
celebrated; and pretty soon he st<unclear/> <lb/>
take me and Jim in. Tom Sa<unclear/> <lb/>
generous that way. There <unclear/> <lb/>
mighty good and friend<unclear/> <lb/>
thing, but when a good <unclear/> <lb/>
way they don't say a <unclear/> <lb/>
all. That warn't ever<unclear/> <lb/>
that for him. There'<unclear/> <lb/>
<pb n="14"/>
hankering and groveling around you when you've got <lb/>
an apple and beg the core off of you; but when they've <lb/>
got one, and you beg for the core and remind them <lb/>
how you give them a core one time, they say thank <lb/>
you 'most to death, but there ain't a-going to be no <lb/>
core. But I notice they always git come up with; all <lb/>
you got to do is to wait.</p>
<p>Well, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom <lb/>
told us what it was. It was a crusade.</p>
<p>"What's a crusade?" I says.</p>
<p>He looked scornful, the way he's always done when <lb/>
he was ashamed of a person, and says:</p>
<p>"Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don't <lb/>
know what a crusade is?"</p>
<p>"No," says I, "I don't. And I don't care to, <lb/>
nuther. I've lived till now and done without it, and <lb/>
had my health, too. But as soon as you tell me, I'll <lb/>
know, and that's soon enough. I don't see any use in <lb/>
finding out things and clogging up my head with them <lb/>
when I mayn't ever have any occasion to use 'em. <lb/>
There was Lance Williams, he learned how to talk <lb/>
<unclear/> here till one come and dug his grave for him. <lb/>
<unclear/> But I can tell you one <lb/>
<unclear/> if it's a patent-right, there's <lb/>
<unclear/> he&#x2014;"</p>
<p><unclear/> "I never see such an <lb/>
<unclear/> of war."</p>
<p><unclear/> his mind. But no, he <lb/>
<unclear/> right on, perfectly <lb/>
<unclear/></p>
<pb n="15"/>
<p>"A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from <lb/>
the paynim."</p>
<p>"Which Holy Land?"</p>
<p>"Why, <i>the</i> Holy Land&#x2014;there ain't but one."</p>
<p>"What do <i>we</i> want of it?"</p>
<p>"Why, can't you understand? It's in the hands of <lb/>
the paynim, and it's our duty to take it away from <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>"How did we come to let them git hold of it?"</p>
<p>"We didn't come to let them git hold of it. They <lb/>
always had it."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, then it must belong to them, don't it?"</p>
<p>"Why of course it does. Who said it didn't?"</p>
<p>I studied over it, but couldn't seem to git at the <lb/>
right of it, no way. I says:</p>
<p>"It's too many for me, Tom Sawyer. If I had a <lb/>
farm and it was mine, and another person wanted it, <lb/>
would it be right for him to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks! you don't know enough to come in <lb/>
when it rains, Huck Finn. It ain't a farm, it's entirely <lb/>
different. You see, it's like this. They own the land, <lb/>
just the mere land, and that's all they <i>do</i> own; but it <lb/>
was our folks, our Jews and Christians, that made it <lb/>
holy, and so they haven't any business to be there <lb/>
defiling it. It's a shame, and we ought not to stand it <lb/>
a minute. We ought to march against them and take <lb/>
it away from them."</p>
<p>"Why, it does seem to me it's the most mixed-up <lb/>
thing I ever see! Now, if I had a farm and another <lb/>
person&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="16"/>
<p>"Don't I tell you it hasn't got anything to do with <lb/>
farming? Farming is business, just common low-down <lb/>
business: that's all it is, it's all you can say for it; but <lb/>
this is higher, this is religious, and totally different."</p>
<p>"Religious to go and take the land away from <lb/>
people that owns it?"</p>
<p>"Certainly; it's always been considered so."</p>
<p>Jim he shook his head, and says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, I reckon dey's a mistake about it <lb/>
somers&#x2014;dey mos' sholy is. I's religious myself, en <lb/>
I knows plenty religious people, but I hain't run across <lb/>
none dat acts like dat."</p>
<p>It made Tom hot, and he says:</p>
<p>"Well, it's enough to make a body sick, such <lb/>
mullet-headed ignorance! If either of you'd read any- <lb/>
thing about history, you'd know that Richard Cur de <lb/>
Loon, and the Pope, and Godfrey de Bulleyn, and lots <lb/>
more of the most noble-hearted and pious people in <lb/>
the world, hacked and hammered at the paynims for <lb/>
more than two hundred years trying to take their land <lb/>
away from them, and swum neck-deep in blood the <lb/>
whole time&#x2014;and yet here's a couple of sap-headed <lb/>
country yahoos out in the backwoods of Missouri set- <lb/>
ting themselves up to know more about the rights and <lb/>
wrongs of it than they did! Talk about cheek!"</p>
<p>Well, of course, that put a more different light on it, <lb/>
and me and Jim felt pretty cheap and ignorant, and <lb/>
wished we hadn't been quite so chipper. I couldn't <lb/>
say nothing, and Jim he couldn't for a while; then he <lb/>
says:</p>
<pb n="17"/>
<p>"Well, den, I reckon it's all right; beca'se ef dey <lb/>
didn't know, dey ain't no use for po' ignorant folks <lb/>
like us to be trying to know; en so, ef it's our duty, <lb/>
we got to go en tackle it en do de bes' we can. Same <lb/>
time, I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom. <lb/>
De hard part gwine to be to kill folks dat a body hain't <lb/>
been 'quainted wid and dat hain't done him no harm. <lb/>
Dat's it, you see. Ef we wuz to go 'mongst 'cm, jist <lb/>
we three, en say we's hungry, en ast 'em for a bite to <lb/>
eat, why, maybe dey's jist like yuther people. Don't <lb/>
you reckon dey is? Why, <i>dey'd</i> give it, I know dey <lb/>
would, en den&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Then what?"</p>
<p>"Well, Mars Tom, my idea is like dis. It ain't no <lb/>
use, we <i>can't</i> kill dem po' strangers dat ain't doin' us <lb/>
no harm, till we've had practice&#x2014;I knows it perfectly <lb/>
well, Mars Tom&#x2014;'deed I knows it perfectly well. But <lb/>
ef we takes a' axe or two, jist you en me en Huck, en <lb/>
slips acrost de river to-night arter de moon's gone <lb/>
down, en kills dat sick fam'ly dat's over on the Sny, <lb/>
en burns dey house down, en&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, you make me tired!" says Tom. "I don't <lb/>
want to argue any more with people like you and Huck <lb/>
Finn, that's always wandering from the subject, and <lb/>
ain't got any more sense than to try to reason out a <lb/>
thing that's pure theology by the laws that protect real <lb/>
estate!"</p>
<p>Now that's just where Tom Sawyer warn't fair. Jim <lb/>
didn't mean no harm, and I didn't mean no harm. <lb/>
We knowed well enough that he was right and we was <lb/>
<pb n="18"/>
wrong, and all we was after was to get at the <i>how</i> of <lb/>
it, and that was all; and the only reason he couldn't <lb/>
explain it so we could understand it was because we <lb/>
was ignorant&#x2014;yes, and pretty dull, too, I ain't deny- <lb/>
ing that; but, land! that ain't no crime, I should think.</p>
<p>But he wouldn't hear no more about it&#x2014;just said if <lb/>
we had tackled the thing in the proper spirit, he would <lb/>
'a' raised a couple of thousand knights and put them <lb/>
in steel armor from head to heel, and made me a lieu- <lb/>
tenant and Jim a sutler, and took the command himself <lb/>
and brushed the whole paynim outfit into the sea like <lb/>
flies and come back across the world in a glory like <lb/>
sunset. But he said we didn't know enough to take <lb/>
the chance when we had it, and he wouldn't ever offer <lb/>
it again. And he didn't. When he once got set, you <lb/>
couldn't budge him.</p>
<p>But I didn't care much. I am peaceable, and don't <lb/>
get up rows with people that ain't doing nothing to <lb/>
me. I allowed if the paynim was satisfied I was, and <lb/>
we would let it stand at that.</p>
<p>Now Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scott's <lb/>
book, which he was always reading. And it <i>was</i> a <lb/>
wild notion, because in my opinion he never could've <lb/>
raised the men, and if he did, as like as not he would've <lb/>
got licked. I took the book and read all about it, and <lb/>
as near as I could make it out, most of the folks that <lb/>
shook farming to go crusading had a mighty rocky <lb/>
time of it.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the balloon ascension</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Well</smcap>, Tom got up one thing after another, but <lb/>
they all had tender spots about 'em somewheres, <lb/>
and he had to shove 'em aside. So at last he was <lb/>
about in despair. Then the St. Louis papers begun to <lb/>
talk a good deal about the balloon that was going to <lb/>
sail to Europe, and Tom sort of thought he wanted <lb/>
to go down and see what it looked like, but couldn't <lb/>
make up his mind. But the papers went on talking, <lb/>
and so he allowed that maybe if he didn't go he <lb/>
mightn't ever have another chance to see a balloon; <lb/>
and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going <lb/>
down to see it, and that decided him, of course. He <lb/>
wasn't going to have Nat Parsons coming back brag- <lb/>
ging about seeing the balloon, and him having to listen <lb/>
to it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go <lb/>
too, and we went.</p>
<p>It was a noble big balloon, and had wings and fans <lb/>
and all sorts of things, and wasn't like any balloon you <lb/>
see in pictures. It was away out toward the edge of <lb/>
town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street; and <lb/>
there was a big crowd around it, making fun of it, and <lb/>
<pb n="20"/>
making fun of the man,&#x2014;a lean pale feller with that <lb/>
soft kind of moonlight in his eyes, you know,&#x2014;and <lb/>
they kept saying it wouldn't go. It made him hot to <lb/>
hear them, and he would turn on them and shake his <lb/>
fist and say they was animals and blind, but some day <lb/>
they would find they had stood face to face with one <lb/>
of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations, <lb/>
and was too dull to know it; and right here on this <lb/>
spot their own children and grandchildren would build <lb/>
a monument to him that would outlast a thousand <lb/>
years, but his name would outlast the monument. <lb/>
And then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, <lb/>
and yell at him, and ask him what was his name before <lb/>
he was married, and what he would take to not do it, <lb/>
and what was his sister's cat's grandmother's name, <lb/>
and all the things that a crowd says when they've got <lb/>
hold of a feller that they see they can plague. Well, <lb/>
some things they said <i>was</i> funny,&#x2014;yes, and mighty <lb/>
witty too, I ain't denying that,&#x2014;but all the same it <lb/>
warn't fair nor brave, all them people pitching on one, <lb/>
and they so glib and sharp, and him without any gift <lb/>
of talk to answer back with. But, good land! what <lb/>
did he want to sass back for? You see, it couldn't do <lb/>
him no good, and it was just nuts for them. They <lb/>
<i>had</i> him, you know. But that was his way. I reckon <lb/>
he couldn't help it; he was made so, I judge. He <lb/>
was a good enough sort of cretur, and hadn't no harm <lb/>
in him, and was just a genius, as the papers said, which <lb/>
wasn't his fault. We can't all be sound: we've got to <lb/>
be the way we're made. As near as I can make out, <lb/>
<pb n="21"/>
geniuses think they know it all, and so they won't take <lb/>
people's advice, but always go their own way, which <lb/>
makes everybody forsake them and despise them, and <lb/>
that is perfectly natural. If they was humbler, and <lb/>
listened and tried to learn, it would be better for them.</p>
<p>The part the professor was in was like a boat, and <lb/>
was big and roomy, and had water-tight lockers around <lb/>
the inside to keep all sorts of things in, and a body <lb/>
could sit on them, and make beds on them, too. We <lb/>
went aboard, and there was twenty people there, snoop- <lb/>
ing around and examining, and old Nat Parsons was <lb/>
there, too. The professor kept fussing around getting <lb/>
ready, and the people went ashore, drifting out one at <lb/>
a time, and old Nat he was the last. Of course it <lb/>
wouldn't do to let him go out behind <i>us</i>. We mustn't <lb/>
budge till he was gone, so we could be last ourselves.</p>
<p>But he was gone now, so it was time for us to follow. <lb/>
I heard a big shout, and turned around&#x2014;the city was <lb/>
dropping from under us like a shot! It made me sick <lb/>
all through, I was so scared. Jim turned gray and <lb/>
couldn't say a word, and Tom didn't say nothing, but <lb/>
looked excited. The city went on dropping down, <lb/>
and down, and down; but we didn't seem to be doing <lb/>
nothing but just hang in the air and stand still. The <lb/>
houses got smaller and smaller, and the city pulled <lb/>
itself together, closer and closer, and the men and <lb/>
wagons got to looking like ants and bugs crawling <lb/>
around, and the streets like threads and cracks; and <lb/>
then it all kind of melted together, and there wasn't <lb/>
any city any more: it was only a big scar on the earth, <lb/>
<pb n="22"/>
and it seemed to me a body could see up the river and <lb/>
down the river about a thousand miles, though of <lb/>
course it wasn't so much. By and by the earth was a <lb/>
ball&#x2014;just a round ball, of a dull color, with shiny <lb/>
stripes wriggling and winding around over it, which <lb/>
was rivers. The Widder Douglas always told me the <lb/>
earth was round like a ball, but I never took any stock <lb/>
in a lot of them superstitions o' hers, and of course I <lb/>
paid no attention to that one, because I could see my- <lb/>
self that the world was the shape of a plate, and flat. <lb/>
I used to go up on the hill, and take a look around <lb/>
and prove it for myself, because I reckon the best way <lb/>
to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine for <lb/>
yourself, and not take anybody's say-so. But I had to <lb/>
give in now that the widder was right. That is, she <lb/>
was right as to the rest of the world, but she warn't <lb/>
right about the part our village is in; that part is the <lb/>
shape of a plate, and flat, I take my oath!</p>
<p>The professor had been quiet all this time, as if he <lb/>
was asleep; but he broke loose now, and he was mighty <lb/>
bitter. He says something like this:</p>
<p>"Idiots! They said it wouldn't go; and they <lb/>
wanted to examine it, and spy around and get the <lb/>
secret of it out of me. But I beat them. Nobody <lb/>
knows the secret but me. Nobody knows what makes <lb/>
it move but me; and it's a new power&#x2014;a new power, <lb/>
and a thousand times the strongest in the earth! <lb/>
Steam's foolishness to it! They said I couldn't go to <lb/>
Europe. To Europe! Why, there's power aboard to <lb/>
last five years, and feed for three months. They are <lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
fools! What do they know about it? Yes, and they <lb/>
said my air-ship was flimsy. Why, she's good for <lb/>
fifty years! I can sail the skies all my life if I want <lb/>
to, and steer where I please, though they laughed at <lb/>
that, and said I couldn't. Couldn't steer! Come <lb/>
here, boy; we'll see. You press these buttons as I <lb/>
tell you."</p>
<p>He made Tom steer the ship all about and every <lb/>
which way, and learnt him the whole thing in nearly <lb/>
no time; and Tom said it was perfectly easy. He <lb/>
made him fetch the ship down 'most to the earth, and <lb/>
had him spin her along so close to the Illinois prairies <lb/>
that a body could talk to the farmers, and hear every- <lb/>
thing they said perfectly plain; and he flung out <lb/>
printed bills to them that told about the balloon, and <lb/>
said it was going to Europe. Tom got so he could <lb/>
steer straight for a tree till he got nearly to it, and then <lb/>
dart up and skin right along over the top of it. Yes, <lb/>
and he showed Tom how to land her; and he done it <lb/>
first-rate, too, and set her down in the prairies as soft <lb/>
as wool. But the minute we started to skip out the <lb/>
professor says, "No, you don't!" and shot her up in <lb/>
the air again. It was awful. I begun to beg, and so <lb/>
did Jim; but it only give his temper a rise, and he <lb/>
begun to rage around and look wild out of his eyes, <lb/>
and I was scared of him.</p>
<p>Well, then he got on to his troubles again, and <lb/>
mourned and grumbled about the way he was treated, <lb/>
and couldn't seem to git over it, and especially people's <lb/>
saying his ship was flimsy. He scoffed at that, and at <lb/>
<pb n="24"/>
their saying she warn't simple and would be always <lb/>
getting out of order. Get out of order! That graveled <lb/>
him; he said that she couldn't any more get out of <lb/>
order than the solar sister.</p>
<p>He got worse and worse, and I never see a person <lb/>
take on so. It give me the cold shivers to see him, <lb/>
and so it did Jim. By and by he got to yelling and <lb/>
screaming, and then he swore the world shouldn't ever <lb/>
have his secret at all now, it had treated him so mean. <lb/>
He said he would sail his balloon around the globe just <lb/>
to show what he could do, and then he would sink it in <lb/>
the sea, and sink us all along with it, too. Well, it was <lb/>
the awfulest fix to be in, and here was night coming <lb/>
on!</p>
<p>He give us something to eat, and made us go to the <lb/>
other end of the boat, and he laid down on a locker, <lb/>
where he could boss all the works, and put his old <lb/>
pepper-box revolver under his head, and said if any- <lb/>
body come fooling around there trying to land her, he <lb/>
would kill him.</p>
<p>We set scrunched up together, and thought consider- <lb/>
able, but didn't say much&#x2014;only just a word once in a <lb/>
while when a body had to say something or bust, we <lb/>
was <i>so</i> scared and worried. The night dragged along <lb/>
slow and lonesome. We was pretty low down, and the <lb/>
moonshine made everything soft and pretty, and the <lb/>
farmhouses looked snug and homeful, and we could <lb/>
hear the farm sounds, and wished we could be down <lb/>
there; but, laws! we just slipped along over them like <lb/>
a ghost, and never left a track.</p>
<pb n="25"/>
<p>Away in the night, when all the sounds was late <lb/>
sounds, and the air had a late feel, and a late smell, <lb/>
too&#x2014;about a two-o'clock feel, as near as I could make <lb/>
out&#x2014;Tom said the professor was so quiet this time <lb/>
he must be asleep, and we'd better&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Better what?" I says in a whisper, and feeling sick <lb/>
all over, because I knowed what he was thinking about.</p>
<p>"Better slip back there and tie him, and land the <lb/>
ship," he says.</p>
<p>I says: "No, sir! Don't you budge, Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>And Jim&#x2014;well, Jim was kind o' gasping, he was so <lb/>
scared. He says:</p>
<p>"Oh, Mars Tom, <i>don't!</i> Ef you teches him, we's <lb/>
gone&#x2014;we's gone sho'! I ain't gwine anear him, not <lb/>
for nothin' in dis worl'. Mars Tom, he's plumb crazy."</p>
<p>Tom whispers and says: "That's <i>why</i> we've got to <lb/>
do something. If he wasn't crazy I wouldn't give <lb/>
shucks to be anywhere but here; you couldn't hire me <lb/>
to get out&#x2014;now that I've got used to this balloon and <lb/>
over the scare of being cut loose from the solid ground <lb/>
&#x2014;if he was in his right mind. But it's no good politics, <lb/>
sailing around like this with a person that's out of his <lb/>
head, and says he's going round the world and then <lb/>
drown us all. We've <i>got</i> to do something, I tell you, <lb/>
and do it before he wakes up, too, or we mayn't ever <lb/>
get another chance. Come!"</p>
<p>But it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of <lb/>
it, and we said we wouldn't budge. So Tom was for <lb/>
slipping back there by himself to see if he couldn't get <lb/>
at the steering-gear and land the ship. We begged and <lb/>
<pb n="26"/>
begged him not to, but it warn't no use; so he got <lb/>
down on his hands and knees, and begun to crawl an <lb/>
inch at a time, we a-holding our breath and watching. <lb/>
After he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower <lb/>
than ever, and it did seem like years to me. But at <lb/>
last we see him get to the professor's head, and sort <lb/>
of raise up soft and look a good spell in his face and <lb/>
listen. Then we see him begin to inch along again <lb/>
toward the professor's feet where the steering-buttons <lb/>
was. Well, he got there all safe, and was reaching <lb/>
slow and steady toward the buttons, but he knocked <lb/>
down something that made a noise, and we see him <lb/>
slump down flat an' soft in the bottom, and lay still. <lb/>
The professor stirred, and says, "What's that?" But <lb/>
everybody kept dead still and quiet, and he begun to <lb/>
mutter and mumble and nestle, like a person that's <lb/>
going to wake up, and I thought I was going to die, I <lb/>
was so worried and scared.</p>
<p>Then a cloud slid over the moon, and I 'most cried, <lb/>
I was so glad. She buried herself deeper and deeper <lb/>
into the cloud, and it got so dark we couldn't see Tom. <lb/>
Then it began to sprinkle rain, and we could hear the <lb/>
professor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing <lb/>
the weather. We was afraid every minute he would <lb/>
touch Tom, and then we would be goners, and no <lb/>
help; but Tom was already on his way back, and when <lb/>
we felt his hands on our knees my breath stopped <lb/>
sudden, and my heart fell down 'mongst my other works, <lb/>
because I couldn't tell in the dark but it might be the <lb/>
professor, which I thought it <i>was</i>.</p>
<pb n="27"/>
<p>Dear! I was so glad to have him back that I was <lb/>
just as near happy as a person could be that was up in <lb/>
the air that way with a deranged man. You can't land <lb/>
a balloon in the dark, and so I hoped it would keep on <lb/>
raining, for I didn't want Tom to go meddling any <lb/>
more and make us so awful uncomfortable. Well, I <lb/>
got my wish. It drizzled and drizzled along the rest <lb/>
of the night, which wasn't long, though it did seem so; <lb/>
and at daybreak it cleared, and the world looked <lb/>
mighty soft and gray and pretty, and the forests and <lb/>
fields so good to see again, and the horses and cattle <lb/>
standing sober and thinking. Next, the sun come a- <lb/>
blazing up gay and splendid, and then we began to feel <lb/>
rusty and stretchy, and first we knowed we was all <lb/>
asleep.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>tom explains</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> went to sleep about four o'clock, and woke up <lb/>
about eight. The professor was setting back <lb/>
there at his end, looking glum. He pitched us some <lb/>
breakfast, but he told us not to come abaft the midship <lb/>
compass. That was about the middle of the boat. <lb/>
Well, when you are sharp-set, and you eat and satisfy <lb/>
yourself, everything looks pretty different from what it <lb/>
done before. It makes a body feel pretty near com- <lb/>
fortable, even when he is up in a balloon with a genius. <lb/>
We got to talking together.</p>
<p>There was one thing that kept bothering me, and by <lb/>
and by I says:</p>
<p>"Tom, didn't we start east?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How fast have we been going?"</p>
<p>"Well, you heard what the professor said when he <lb/>
was raging round. Sometimes, he said, we was making <lb/>
fifty miles an hour, sometimes ninety, sometimes a <lb/>
hundred; said that with a gale to help he could make <lb/>
three hundred any time, and said if he wanted the gale, <lb/>
and wanted it blowing the right direction, he only had <lb/>
to go up higher or down lower to find it."</p>
<pb n="29"/>
<p>"Well, then, it's just as I reckoned. The professor <lb/>
lied."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because if we was going so fast we ought to be <lb/>
past Illinois, oughtn't we?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Well, we ain't."</p>
<p>"What's the reason we ain't?"</p>
<p>"I know by the color. We're right over Illinois <lb/>
yet. And you can see for yourself that Indiana ain't <lb/>
in sight."</p>
<p>"I wonder what's the matter with you, Huck. You <lb/>
know by the <i>color?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course I do."</p>
<p>"What's the color got to do with it?"</p>
<p>"It's got everything to do with it. Illinois is green, <lb/>
Indiana is pink. You show me any pink down here, <lb/>
if you can. No, sir; it's green."</p>
<p>"Indiana <i>pink?</i> Why, what a lie!"</p>
<p>"It ain't no lie; I've seen it on the map, and it's <lb/>
pink."</p>
<p>You never see a person so aggravated and disgusted. <lb/>
He says:</p>
<p>"Well, if I was such a numbskull as you, Huck <lb/>
Finn, I would jump over. Seen it on the map! Huck <lb/>
Finn, did you reckon the States was the same color <lb/>
out-of-doors as they are on the map?"</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, what's a map for? Ain't it to learn <lb/>
you facts?"</p>
<p>"Of course.'</p>
<pb n="30"/>
<p>"Well, then, how's it going to do that if it tells lies? <lb/>
That's what I want to know."</p>
<p>"Shucks, you muggins! It don't tell lies."</p>
<p>"It don't, don't it?"</p>
<p>"No, it don't."</p>
<p>"All right, then; if it don't, there ain't no two <lb/>
States the same color. You git around <i>that</i>, if you <lb/>
can, Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>He see I had him, and Jim see it too; and I tell <lb/>
you, I felt pretty good, for Tom Sawyer was always a <lb/>
hard person to git ahead of. Jim slapped his leg and <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"I tell <i>you!</i> dat's smart, dat's right down smart. <lb/>
Ain't no use, Mars Tom; he got you <i>dis</i> time, sho'!" <lb/>
He slapped his leg again, and says, "My <i>lan</i>', but it <lb/>
was smart one!"</p>
<p>I never felt so good in my life; and yet <i>I</i> didn't <lb/>
know I was saying anything much till it was out. I <lb/>
was just mooning along, perfectly careless, and not <lb/>
expecting anything was going to happen, and never <lb/>
<i>thinking</i> of such a thing at all, when, all of a sudden, <lb/>
out it came. Why, it was just as much a surprise to <lb/>
me as it was to any of them. It was just the same way <lb/>
it is when a person is munching along on a hunk of <lb/>
corn-pone, and not thinking about anything, and all of <lb/>
a sudden bites into a di'mond. Now all that <i>he</i> knows <lb/>
first off is that it's some kind of gravel he's bit into; <lb/>
but he don't find out it's a di'mond till he gits it out <lb/>
and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing or <lb/>
another, and has a look at it, and then he's surprised <lb/>
<pb n="31"/>
and glad&#x2014;yes, and proud too; though when you <lb/>
come to look the thing straight in the eye, he ain't <lb/>
entitled to as much credit as he would 'a' been if he'd <lb/>
been <i>hunting</i> di'monds. You can see the difference <lb/>
easy if you think it over. You see, an accident, that <lb/>
way, ain't fairly as big a thing as a thing that's done <lb/>
a-purpose. Anybody could find that di'mond in that <lb/>
corn-pone; but mind you, it's got to be somebody <lb/>
that's got <i>that kind of a corn-pone</i>. That's where that <lb/>
feller's credit comes in, you see; and that's where <lb/>
mine comes in. I don't claim no great things&#x2014;I <lb/>
don't reckon I could 'a' done it again&#x2014;but I done it <lb/>
that time; that's all I claim. And I hadn't no more <lb/>
idea I could do such a thing, and warn't any more <lb/>
thinking about it or trying to, than you be this minute. <lb/>
Why, I was just as ca'm, a body couldn't be any <lb/>
ca'mer, and yet, all of a sudden, out it come. I've <lb/>
often thought of that time, and I can remember just <lb/>
the way everything looked, same as if it was only last <lb/>
week. I can see it all: beautiful rolling country with <lb/>
woods and fields and lakes for hundreds and hundreds <lb/>
of miles all around, and towns and villages scattered <lb/>
everywheres under us, here and there and yonder; and <lb/>
the professor mooning over a chart on his little table, <lb/>
and Tom's cap flopping in the rigging where it was <lb/>
hung up to dry. And one thing in particular was a <lb/>
bird right alongside, not ten foot off, going our way <lb/>
and trying to keep up, but losing ground all the time; <lb/>
and a railroad train doing the same thing down there, <lb/>
sliding among the trees and farms, and pouring out a <lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
long cloud of black smoke and now and then a little <lb/>
puff of white; and when the white was gone so long <lb/>
you had almost forgot it, you would hear a little faint <lb/>
toot, and that was the whistle. And we left the bird <lb/>
and the train both behind, '<i>way</i> behind, and done it <lb/>
easy, too.</p>
<p>But Tom he was huffy, and said me and Jim was a <lb/>
couple of ignorant blatherskites, and then he says:</p>
<p>"Suppose there's a brown calf and a big brown dog, <lb/>
and an artist is making a picture of them. What is the <lb/>
<i>main</i> thing that that artist has got to do? He has got <lb/>
to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute <lb/>
you look at them, hain't he? Of course. Well, then, <lb/>
do you want him to go and paint <i>both</i> of them brown? <lb/>
Certainly you don't. He paints one of them blue, <lb/>
and then you can't make no mistake. It's just the <lb/>
same with the maps. That's why they make every <lb/>
State a different color; it ain't to deceive you, it's to <lb/>
keep you from deceiving yourself."</p>
<p>But I couldn't see no argument about that, and <lb/>
neither could Jim. Jim shook his head, and says:</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, if you knowed what chuckle- <lb/>
heads dem painters is, you'd wait a long time before <lb/>
you'd fetch one er <i>dem</i> in to back up a fac'. I's <lb/>
gwine to tell you, den you kin see for you'self. I see <lb/>
one of 'em a-paintin' away, one day, down in ole <lb/>
Hank Wilson's back lot, en I went down to see, en he <lb/>
was paintin' dat old brindle cow wid de near horn <lb/>
gone&#x2014;you knows de one I means. En I ast him <lb/>
what he's paintin' her for, en he say when he git her <lb/>
<pb n="33"/>
painted, de picture's wuth a hundred dollars. Mars <lb/>
Tom, he could a got de cow fer fifteen, en I <i>tole</i> him <lb/>
so. Well, sah, if you'll b'lieve me, he jes' shuck his <lb/>
head, dat painter did, en went on a-dobbin'. Bless <lb/>
you, Mars Tom, <i>dey</i> don't know nothin'."</p>
<p>Tom lost his temper. I notice a person 'most always <lb/>
does that's got laid out in an argument. He told us to <lb/>
shut up, and maybe we'd feel better. Then he see a <lb/>
town clock away off down yonder, and he took up the <lb/>
glass and looked at it, and then looked at his silver <lb/>
turnip, and then at the clock, and then at the turnip <lb/>
again, and says:</p>
<p>"That's funny! That clock's near about an hour <lb/>
fast."</p>
<p>So he put up his turnip. Then he see another clock, <lb/>
and took a look, and it was an hour fast too. That <lb/>
puzzled him.</p>
<p>"That's a mighty curious thing," he says. "I <lb/>
don't understand it."</p>
<p>Then he took the glass and hunted up another clock, <lb/>
and sure enough it was an hour fast too. Then his <lb/>
eyes began to spread and his breath to come out kinder <lb/>
gaspy like, and he says:</p>
<p>"Ger-reat Scott, it's the <i>longitude!</i>"</p>
<p>I says, considerably scared:</p>
<p>"Well, what's been and gone and happened now?"</p>
<p>"Why, the thing that's happened is that this old <lb/>
bladder has slid over Illinois and Indiana and Ohio like <lb/>
nothing, and this is the east end of Pennsylvania or <lb/>
New York, or somewheres around there."</p>
<pb n="34"/>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, you don't mean it!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do, and it's dead sure. We've covered <lb/>
about fifteen degrees of longitude since we left St. <lb/>
Louis yesterday afternoon, and them clocks are <i>right.</i> <lb/>
We've come close on to eight hundred miles."</p>
<p>I didn't believe it, but it made the cold streaks <lb/>
trickle down my back just the same. In my experi- <lb/>
ence I knowed it wouldn't take much short of two <lb/>
weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft.</p>
<p>Jim was working his mind and studying. Pretty <lb/>
soon he says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, did you say dem clocks uz right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they're right."</p>
<p>"Ain't yo' watch right, too?"</p>
<p>"She's right for St. Louis, but she's an hour wrong <lb/>
for here."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, is you tryin' to let on dat de time ain't <lb/>
de <i>same</i> everywheres?"</p>
<p>"No, it ain't the same everywheres, by a long <lb/>
shot."</p>
<p>Jim looked distressed, and says:</p>
<p>"It grieves me to hear you talk like dat, Mars Tom; <lb/>
I's right down ashamed to hear you talk like dat, arter <lb/>
de way you's been raised. Yassir, it'd break yo' Aunt <lb/>
Polly's heart to hear you."</p>
<p>Tom was astonished. He looked Jim over wonder- <lb/>
ing, and didn't say nothing, and Jim went on:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, who put de people out yonder in St. <lb/>
Louis? De Lord done it. Who put de people here <lb/>
whar we is? De Lord done it. Ain' dey bofe his <lb/>
<pb n="35"/>
children? 'Cose dey is. <i>Well</i>, den! is he gwine to <lb/>
<i>scriminate</i> 'twixt 'em?"</p>
<p>"Scriminate! I never heard such ignorance. There <lb/>
ain't no discriminating about it. When he makes you <lb/>
and some more of his children black, and makes the <lb/>
rest of us white, what do you call that?"</p>
<p>Jim see the p'int. He was stuck. He couldn't <lb/>
answer. Tom says:</p>
<p>"He does discriminate, you see, when he wants to; <lb/>
but this case <i>here</i> ain't no discrimination of his, it's <lb/>
man's. The Lord made the day, and he made the <lb/>
night; but he didn't invent the hours, and he didn't <lb/>
distribute them around. Man did that."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, is dat so? Man done it?"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"Who tole him he could?"</p>
<p>"Nobody. He never asked."</p>
<p>Jim studied a minute, and says:</p>
<p>"Well, dat do beat me. I wouldn't 'a' tuck no <lb/>
sich resk. But some people ain't scared o' nothin'. <lb/>
Dey bangs right ahead; <i>dey</i> don't care what happens. <lb/>
So den dey's allays an hour's diff'unce everywhah, <lb/>
Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"An hour? No! It's four minutes difference for <lb/>
every degree of longitude, you know. Fifteen of 'em's <lb/>
an hour, thirty of 'em's two hours, and so on. When <lb/>
it's one clock Tuesday morning in England, it's eight <lb/>
o'clock the night before in New York."</p>
<p>Jim moved a little way along the locker, and you <lb/>
could see he was insulted. He kept shaking his head <lb/>
<pb n="36"/>
and muttering, and so I slid along to him and patted <lb/>
him on the leg, and petted him up, and got him over <lb/>
the worst of his feelings, and then he says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom talkin' sich talk as dat! Choosday in <lb/>
one place en Monday in t'other, bofe in the same day! <lb/>
Huck, dis ain't no place to joke&#x2014;up here whah we is. <lb/>
Two days in one day! How you gwine to get two <lb/>
days inter one day? Can't git two hours inter one <lb/>
hour, kin you? Can't git two niggers inter one nigger <lb/>
skin, kin you? Can't git two gallons of whisky inter a <lb/>
one-gallon jug, kin you? No, sir, 'twould strain de <lb/>
jug. Yes, en even den you couldn't, <i>I</i> don't believe. <lb/>
Why, looky here, Huck, s'posen de Choosday was <lb/>
New Year's&#x2014;now den! is you gwine to tell me it's <lb/>
dis year in one place en las' year in t'other, bofe in de <lb/>
identical same minute? It's de beatenest rubbage! I <lb/>
can't stan' it&#x2014;I can't stan' to hear tell 'bout it." <lb/>
Then he begun to shiver and turn gray, and Tom <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i> what's the matter? What's the trouble?"</p>
<p>Jim could hardly speak, but he says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, you ain't jokin', en it's <i>so?</i>"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not, and it <i>is</i> so."</p>
<p>Jim shivered again, and says:</p>
<p>"Den dat Monday could be de las' day, en dey <lb/>
wouldn't be no las' day in England, en de dead <lb/>
wouldn't be called. We mustn't go over dah, Mars <lb/>
Tom. Please git him to turn back; I wants to be <lb/>
whah&#x2014;"</p>
<p>All of a sudden we see something, and all jumped <lb/>
<pb n="37"/>
up, and forgot everything and begun to gaze. Tom <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"Ain't that the&#x2014;" He catched his breath, then <lb/>
says: "It <i>is</i>, sure as you live! It's the ocean!"</p>
<p>That made me and Jim catch our breath, too. Then <lb/>
we all stood petrified but happy, for none of us had <lb/>
ever seen an ocean, or ever expected to. Tom kept <lb/>
muttering:</p>
<p>"Atlantic Ocean&#x2014;Atlantic. Land, don't it sound <lb/>
great! And that's <i>it</i>&#x2014;and <i>we</i> are looking at it&#x2014;we! <lb/>
Why, it's just too splendid to believe!"</p>
<p>Then we see a big bank of black smoke; and when <lb/>
we got nearer, it was a city&#x2014;and a monster she was, <lb/>
too, with a thick fringe of ships around one edge; and <lb/>
we wondered if it was New York, and begun to jaw <lb/>
and dispute about it, and, first we knowed, it slid from <lb/>
under us and went flying behind, and here we was, out <lb/>
over the very ocean itself, and going like a cyclone. <lb/>
Then we woke up, I tell you!</p>
<p>We made a break aft and raised a wail, and begun to <lb/>
beg the professor to turn back and land us, but <lb/>
he jerked out his pistol and motioned us back, <lb/>
and we went, but nobody will ever know how bad we <lb/>
felt.</p>
<p>The land was gone, all but a little streak, like a <lb/>
snake, away off on the edge of the water, and down <lb/>
under us was just ocean, ocean, ocean&#x2014;millions of <lb/>
miles of it, heaving and pitching and squirming, and <lb/>
white sprays blowing from the wave-tops, and only a <lb/>
few ships in sight, wallowing around and laying over, <lb/>
<pb n="38"/>
first on one side and then on t'other, and sticking their <lb/>
bows under and then their sterns; and before long <lb/>
there warn't no ships at all, and we had the sky and <lb/>
the whole ocean all to ourselves, and the roomiest place <lb/>
I ever see and the lonesomest.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER IV.</b></head>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>storm</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>And</smcap> it got lonesomer and lonesomer. There was <lb/>
the big sky up there, empty and awful deep; and <lb/>
the ocean down there without a thing on it but just the <lb/>
waves. All around us was a ring, where the sky and <lb/>
the water come together; yes, a monstrous big ring it <lb/>
was, and we right in the dead center of it&#x2014;plumb in <lb/>
the center. We was racing along like a prairie fire, but <lb/>
it never made any difference, we couldn't seem to git <lb/>
past that center no way. I couldn't see that we ever <lb/>
gained an inch on that ring. It made a body feel <lb/>
creepy, it was so curious and unaccountable.</p>
<p>Well, everything was so awful still that we got to <lb/>
talking in a very low voice, and kept on getting creepier <lb/>
and lonesomer and less and less talky, till at last the <lb/>
talk ran dry altogether, and we just set there and <lb/>
"thunk," as Jim calls it, and never said a word the <lb/>
longest time.</p>
<p>The professor never stirred till the sun was overhead, <lb/>
then he stood up and put a kind of triangle to his eye, <lb/>
and Tom said it was a sextant and he was taking the <lb/>
sun to see whereabouts the balloon was. Then he <lb/>
ciphered a little and looked in a book, and then he <lb/>
<pb n="40"/>
begun to carry on again. He said lots of wild things, <lb/>
and, among others, he said he would keep up this <lb/>
hundred-mile gait till the middle of to-morrow after- <lb/>
noon, and then he'd land in London.</p>
<p>We said we would be humbly thankful.</p>
<p>He was turning away, but he whirled around when <lb/>
we said that, and give us a long look of his blackest <lb/>
kind&#x2014;one of the maliciousest and suspiciousest looks <lb/>
I ever see. Then he says:</p>
<p>"You want to leave me. Don't try to deny it."</p>
<p>We didn't know what to say, so we held in and <lb/>
didn't say nothing at all.</p>
<p>He went aft and set down, but he couldn't seem to <lb/>
git that thing out of his mind. Every now and then he <lb/>
would rip out something about it, and try to make us <lb/>
answer him, but we dasn't.</p>
<p>It got lonesomer and lonesomer right along, and it <lb/>
did seem to me I couldn't stand it. It was still worse <lb/>
when night begun to come on. By and by Tom <lb/>
pinched me and whispers:</p>
<p>"Look!"</p>
<p>I took a glance aft, and see the professor taking a <lb/>
whet out of a bottle. I didn't like the looks of that. <lb/>
By and by he took another drink, and pretty soon he <lb/>
begun to sing. It was dark now, and getting black <lb/>
and stormy. He went on singing, wilder and wilder, <lb/>
and the thunder begun to mutter, and the wind to <lb/>
wheeze and moan among the ropes, and altogether it <lb/>
was awful. It got so black we couldn't see him any <lb/>
more, and wished we couldn't hear him, but we could. <lb/>
<pb n="41"/>
Then he got still; but he warn't still ten minutes till <lb/>
we got suspicious, and wished he would start up his <lb/>
noise again, so we could tell where he was. By and by <lb/>
there was a flash of lightning, and we see him start to <lb/>
get up, but he staggered and fell down. We heard <lb/>
him scream out in the dark:</p>
<p>"They don't want to go to England. All right, I'll <lb/>
change the course. They want to leave me. I know <lb/>
they do. Well, they shall&#x2014;and <i>now!</i>"</p>
<p>I 'most died when he said that. Then he was still <lb/>
again&#x2014;still so long I couldn't bear it, and it did seem <lb/>
to me the lightning wouldn't <i>ever</i> come again. But at <lb/>
last there was a blessed flash, and there he was, on his <lb/>
hands and knees crawling, and not four feet from us. <lb/>
My, but his eyes was terrible! He made a lunge for <lb/>
Tom, and says, "Overboard <i>you</i> go!" but it was <lb/>
already pitch-dark again, and I couldn't see whether <lb/>
he got him or not, and Tom didn't make a sound.</p>
<p>There was another long, horrible wait; then there <lb/>
was a flash, and I see Tom's head sink down outside <lb/>
the boat and disappear. He was on the rope-ladder <lb/>
that dangled down in the air from the gunnel. The <lb/>
professor let off a shout and jumped for him, and <lb/>
straight off it was pitch-dark again, and Jim groaned <lb/>
out, "Po' Mars Tom, he's a goner!" and made a <lb/>
jump for the professor, but the professor warn't there.</p>
<p>Then we heard a couple of terrible screams, and then <lb/>
another not so loud, and then another that was 'way <lb/>
below, and you could only <i>just</i> hear it; and I heard <lb/>
Jim say, "Po' Mars Tom!"</p>
<pb n="42"/>
<p>Then it was awful still, and I reckon a person could <lb/>
'a' counted four thousand before the next flash come. <lb/>
When it come I see Jim on his knees, with his arms <lb/>
on the locker and his face buried in them, and he was <lb/>
crying. Before I could look over the edge it was all <lb/>
dark again, and I was glad, because I didn't want to <lb/>
see. But when the next flash come, I was watching, <lb/>
and down there I see somebody a-swinging in the wind <lb/>
on the ladder, and it was Tom!</p>
<p>"Come up!" I shouts; "come up, Tom!"</p>
<p>His voice was so weak, and the wind roared so, I <lb/>
couldn't make out what he said, but I thought he asked <lb/>
was the professor up there. I shouts:</p>
<p>"No, he's down in the ocean! Come up! Can <lb/>
we help you?"</p>
<p>Of course, all this in the dark.</p>
<p>"Huck, who is you hollerin' at?"</p>
<p>"I'm hollerin' at Tom."</p>
<p>"Oh, Huck, how kin you act so, when you know <lb/>
po' Mars Tom&#x2014;" Then he let off an awful scream, <lb/>
and flung his head and his arms back and let off another <lb/>
one, because there was a white glare just then, and he <lb/>
had raised up his face just in time to see Tom's, as <lb/>
white as snow, rise above the gunnel and look him right <lb/>
in the eye. He thought it was Tom's ghost, you <lb/>
see.</p>
<p>Tom clumb aboard, and when Jim found it <i>was</i> him, <lb/>
and not his ghost, he hugged him, and called him all <lb/>
sorts of loving names, and carried on like he was gone <lb/>
crazy, he was so glad. Says I:</p>
<pb n="43"/>
<p>"What did you wait for, Tom? Why didn't you <lb/>
come up at first?"</p>
<p>"I dasn't, Huck. I knowed somebody plunged <lb/>
down past me, but I didn't know who it was in the <lb/>
dark. It could 'a' been you, it could 'a' been Jim."</p>
<p>That was the way with Tom Sawyer&#x2014;always sound. <lb/>
He warn't coming up till he knowed where the pro- <lb/>
fessor was.</p>
<p>The storm let go about this time with all its might; <lb/>
and it was dreadful the way the thunder boomed and <lb/>
tore, and the lightning glared out, and the wind sung <lb/>
and screamed in the rigging, and the rain come down. <lb/>
One second you couldn't see your hand before you, <lb/>
and the next you could count the threads in your coat- <lb/>
sleeve, and see a whole wide desert of waves pitching <lb/>
and tossing through a kind of veil of rain. A storm <lb/>
like that is the loveliest thing there is, but it ain't at its <lb/>
best when you are up in the sky and lost, and it's wet <lb/>
and lonesome, and there's just been a death in the <lb/>
family.</p>
<p>We set there huddled up in the bow, and talked low <lb/>
about the poor professor; and everybody was sorry <lb/>
for him, and sorry the world had made fun of him and <lb/>
treated him so harsh, when he was doing the best he <lb/>
could, and hadn't a friend nor nobody to encourage <lb/>
him and keep him from brooding his mind away and <lb/>
going deranged. There was plenty of clothes and <lb/>
blankets and everything at the other end, but we <lb/>
thought we'd ruther take the rain than go meddling <lb/>
back there.</p>

<p><smcap>We</smcap> tried to make some plans, but we couldn't come <lb/>
to no agreement. Me and Jim was for turning <lb/>
around and going back home, but Tom allowed that <lb/>
by the time daylight come, so we could see our way, <lb/>
we would be so far toward England that we might as <lb/>
well go there, and come back in a ship, and have the <lb/>
glory of saying we done it.</p>
<p>About midnight the storm quit and the moon come <lb/>
out and lit up the ocean, and we begun to feel com- <lb/>
fortable and drowsy; so we stretched out on the <lb/>
lockers and went to sleep, and never woke up again <lb/>
till sun-up. The sea was sparkling like di'monds, and <lb/>
it was nice weather, and pretty soon our things was all <lb/>
dry again.</p>
<p>We went aft to find some breakfast, and the first <lb/>
thing we noticed was that there was a dim light burning <lb/>
in a compass back there under a hood. Then Tom was <lb/>
disturbed. He says:</p>
<p>"You know what that means, easy enough. It <lb/>
means that somebody has got to stay on watch and <lb/>
steer this thing the same as he would a ship, or she'll <lb/>
<pb n="45"/>
wander around and go wherever the wind wants her <lb/>
to."</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "what's she been doing since&#x2014; <lb/>
er&#x2014;since we had the accident?"</p>
<p>"Wandering," he says, kinder troubled&#x2014;"wander- <lb/>
ing, without any doubt. She's in a wind now that's <lb/>
blowing her south of east. We don't know how long <lb/>
that's been going on, either."</p>
<p>So then he p'inted her east, and said he would hold <lb/>
her there till we rousted out the breakfast. The pro- <lb/>
fessor had laid in everything a body could want; he <lb/>
couldn't 'a' been better fixed. There wasn't no milk <lb/>
for the coffee, but there was water, and everything <lb/>
else you could want, and a charcoal stove and the <lb/>
fixings for it, and pipes and cigars and matches; and <lb/>
wine and liquor, which warn't in our line; and books, <lb/>
and maps, and charts, and an accordion; and furs, <lb/>
and blankets, and no end of rubbish, like brass beads <lb/>
and brass jewelry, which Tom said was a sure sign that <lb/>
he had an idea of visiting among savages. There was <lb/>
money, too. Yes, the professor was well enough fixed.</p>
<p>After breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to <lb/>
steer, and divided us all up into four-hour watches, <lb/>
turn and turn about; and when his watch was out I <lb/>
took his place, and he got out the professor's papers <lb/>
and pens and wrote a letter home to his aunt Polly, tell- <lb/>
ing her everything that had happened to us, and dated <lb/>
it "<i>In the Welkin, approaching England</i>," and folded <lb/>
it together and stuck it fast with a red wafer, and <lb/>
directed it, and wrote above the direction, in big <lb/>
<pb n="46"/>
writing, "<i>From Tom Sawyer, the Erronort</i>," and said <lb/>
it would stump old Nat Parsons, the postmaster, when <lb/>
it come along in the mail. I says:</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, this ain't no welkin; it's a balloon."</p>
<p>"Well, now, who <i>said</i> it was a welkin, smarty?"</p>
<p>"You've wrote it on the letter, anyway."</p>
<p>"What of it? That don't mean that the balloon's <lb/>
the welkin."</p>
<p>"Oh, I thought it did. Well, then, what is a <lb/>
welkin?"</p>
<p>I see in a minute he was stuck. He raked and <lb/>
scraped around in his mind, but he couldn't find noth- <lb/>
ing, so he had to say:</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> don't know, and nobody don't know. It's just <lb/>
a word, and it's a mighty good word, too. There <lb/>
ain't many that lays over it. I don't believe there's <lb/>
<i>any</i> that does."</p>
<p>"Shucks!" I says. "But what does it <i>mean?</i>&#x2014; <lb/>
that's the p'int."</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> don't know what it means, I tell you. It's a <lb/>
word that people uses for&#x2014;for&#x2014;well, it's orna- <lb/>
mental. They don't put ruffles on a shirt to keep a <lb/>
person warm, do they?"</p>
<p>"Course they don't."</p>
<p>"But they put them <i>on</i>, don't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"All right, then; that letter I wrote is a shirt, and <lb/>
the welkin's the ruffle on it."</p>
<p>I judged that that would gravel Jim, and it did.</p>
<p>"Now, Mars Tom, it ain't no use to talk like <unclear>dat</unclear> <lb/>
<pb n="47"/>
en, moreover, it's sinful. You knows a letter ain't no <lb/>
shirt, en dey ain't no ruffles on it, nuther. Dey ain't <lb/>
no place to put 'em on; you can't put 'em on, and <lb/>
dey wouldn't stay ef you did."</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> shut up, and wait till something's started <lb/>
that you know something about."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, sholy you can't mean to say I <lb/>
don't know about shirts, when, goodness knows, I's <lb/>
toted home de washin' ever sence&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I tell you, this hasn't got anything to <i>do</i> with <lb/>
shirts. I only&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, you said yo'self dat a letter&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Do you want to drive me crazy? Keep still. I <lb/>
only used it as a metaphor."</p>
<p>That word kinder bricked us up for a minute. Then <lb/>
Jim says&#x2014;rather timid, because he see Tom was get- <lb/>
ting pretty tetchy:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, what is a metaphor?"</p>
<p>"A metaphor's a&#x2014;well, it's a&#x2014;a&#x2014;a metaphor's <lb/>
an illustration." He see <i>that</i> didn't git home, so he <lb/>
tried again. "When I say birds of a feather flocks <lb/>
together, it's a metaphorical way of saying&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But dey <i>don't</i>, Mars Tom. No, sir, 'deed dey <lb/>
don't. Dey ain't no feathers dat's more alike den a <lb/>
bluebird en a jaybird, but ef you waits till you catches <lb/>
<i>dem</i> birds together, you'll&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, give us a rest! You can't get the simplest <lb/>
little thing through your thick skull. Now don't bother <lb/>
me any more."</p>
<p>Jim was satisfied to stop. He was dreadful pleased <lb/>
<pb n="48"/>
with himself for catching Tom out. The minute Tom <lb/>
begun to talk about birds I judged he was a goner, <lb/>
because Jim knowed more about birds than both of us <lb/>
put together. You see, he had killed hundreds and <lb/>
hundreds of them, and that's the way to find out <lb/>
about birds. That's the way people does that writes <lb/>
books about birds, and loves them so that they'll <lb/>
go hungry and tired and take any amount of trouble to <lb/>
find a new bird and kill it. Their name is ornitholo- <lb/>
gers, and I could have been an ornithologer myself, <lb/>
because I always loved birds and creatures; and I <lb/>
started out to learn how to be one, and I see a bird <lb/>
setting on a limb of a high tree, singing with its head <lb/>
tilted back and its mouth open, and before I thought I <lb/>
fired, and his song stopped and he fell straight down <lb/>
from the limb, all limp like a rag, and I run and picked <lb/>
him up and he was dead, and his body was warm in my <lb/>
hand, and his head rolled about this way and that, like <lb/>
his neck was broke, and there was a little white skin <lb/>
over his eyes, and one little drop of blood on the side <lb/>
of his head; and, laws! I couldn't see nothing more <lb/>
for the tears; and I hain't never murdered no creature <lb/>
since that warn't doing me no harm, and I ain't going <lb/>
to.</p>
<p>But I was aggravated about that welkin. I wanted <lb/>
to know. I got the subject up again, and then Tom <lb/>
explained, the best he could. He said when a person <lb/>
made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of <lb/>
the people made the welkin ring. He said they always <lb/>
said that, but none of them ever told what it was, so <lb/>
<pb n="49"/>
he allowed it just meant outdoors and up high. Well, <lb/>
that seemed sensible enough, so I was satisfied, and <lb/>
said so. That pleased Tom and put him in a good <lb/>
humor again, and he says:</p>
<p>"Well, it's all right, then; and we'll let bygones <lb/>
be bygones. I don't know for certain what a welkin <lb/>
is, but when we land in London we'll make it ring, <lb/>
anyway, and don't you forget it."</p>
<p>He said an erronort was a person who sailed around <lb/>
in balloons; and said it was a mighty sight finer to be <lb/>
Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to be Tom Sawyer the <lb/>
Traveler, and we would be heard of all round the <lb/>
world, if we pulled through all right, and so he wouldn't <lb/>
give shucks to be a traveler now.</p>
<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon we got every- <lb/>
thing ready to land, and we felt pretty good, too, and <lb/>
proud; and we kept watching with the glasses, like <lb/>
Columbus discovering America. But we couldn't see <lb/>
nothing but ocean. The afternoon wasted out and the <lb/>
sun shut down, and still there warn't no land any- <lb/>
wheres. We wondered what was the matter, but <lb/>
reckoned it would come out all right, so we went on <lb/>
steering east, but went up on a higher level so we <lb/>
wouldn't hit any steeples or mountains in the dark.</p>
<p>It was my watch till midnight, and then it was Jim's; <lb/>
but Tom stayed up, because he said ship captains done <lb/>
that when they was making the land, and didn't stand <lb/>
no regular watch.</p>
<p>Well, when daylight come, Jim give a shout, and we <lb/>
jumped up and looked over, and there was the land <lb/>
<pb n="50"/>
sure enough&#x2014;land all around, as far as you could see, <lb/>
and perfectly level and yaller. We didn't know how <lb/>
long we'd been over it. There warn't no trees, nor <lb/>
hills, nor rocks, nor towns, and Tom and Jim had took <lb/>
it for the sea. They took it for the sea in a dead <lb/>
ca'm; but we was so high up, anyway, that if it had <lb/>
been the sea and rough, it would 'a' looked smooth, all <lb/>
the same, in the night, that way.</p>
<p>We was all in a powerful excitement now, and <lb/>
grabbed the glasses and hunted everywheres for Lon- <lb/>
don, but couldn't find hair nor hide of it, nor any <lb/>
other settlement&#x2014;nor any sign of a lake or a river, <lb/>
either. Tom was clean beat. He said it warn't his <lb/>
notion of England; he thought England looked like <lb/>
America, and always had that idea. So he said we <lb/>
better have breakfast, and then drop down and inquire <lb/>
the quickest way to London. We cut the breakfast <lb/>
pretty short, we was so impatient. As we slanted <lb/>
along down, the weather began to moderate, and <lb/>
pretty soon we shed our furs. But it kept <i>on</i> moder- <lb/>
ating, and in a precious little while it was 'most too <lb/>
moderate. We was close down now, and just blistering!</p>
<p>We settled down to within thirty foot of the land&#x2014; <lb/>
that is, it was land if sand is land; for this wasn't any- <lb/>
thing but pure sand. Tom and me clumb down the <lb/>
ladder and took a run to stretch our legs, and it felt <lb/>
amazing good&#x2014;that is, the stretching did, but the <lb/>
sand scorched our feet like hot embers. Next, we see <lb/>
somebody coming, and started to meet him; but we <lb/>
heard Jim shout, and looked around and he was fairly <lb/>
<pb n="51"/>
dancing, and making signs, and yelling. We couldn't <lb/>
make out what he said, but we was scared anyway, and <lb/>
begun to heel it back to the balloon. When we got <lb/>
close enough, we understood the words, and they <lb/>
made me sick:</p>
<p>"Run! Run fo' yo' life! Hit's a lion; I kin see <lb/>
him thoo de glass! Run, boys; do please heel it de <lb/>
bes' you kin. He's bu'sted outen de menagerie, en <lb/>
dey ain't nobody to stop him!"</p>
<p>It made Tom fly, but it took the stiffening all out of <lb/>
my legs. I could only just gasp along the way you do <lb/>
in a dream when there's a ghost gaining on you.</p>
<p>Tom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and <lb/>
waited for me; and as soon as I got a foothold on it <lb/>
he shouted to Jim to soar away. But Jim had clean <lb/>
lost his head, and said he had forgot how. So Tom <lb/>
shinned along up and told me to follow; but the lion <lb/>
was arriving, fetching a most ghastly roar with every <lb/>
lope, and my legs shook so I dasn't try to take one of <lb/>
them out of the rounds for fear the other one would <lb/>
give way under me.</p>
<p>But Tom was aboard by this time, and he started the <lb/>
balloon up a little, and stopped it again as soon as the <lb/>
end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above ground. <lb/>
And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me, <lb/>
and roaring and springing up in the air at the ladder, <lb/>
and only missing it about a quarter of an inch, it <lb/>
seemed to me. It was delicious to be out of his reach, <lb/>
perfectly delicious, and made me feel good and thank- <lb/>
ful all up one side; but I was hanging there helpless <lb/>
<pb n="52"/>
and couldn't climb, and that made me feel perfectly <lb/>
wretched and miserable all down the other. It is most <lb/>
seldom that a person feels so mixed like that; and it is <lb/>
not to be recommended, either.</p>
<p>Tom asked me what he'd better do, but I didn't <lb/>
know. He asked me if I could hold on whilst he sailed <lb/>
away to a safe place and left the lion behind. I said I <lb/>
could if he didn't go no higher than he was now; but <lb/>
if he went higher I would lose my head and fall, sure. <lb/>
So he said, "Take a good grip," and he started.</p>
<p>"Don't go so fast," I shouted. "It makes my <lb/>
head swim."</p>
<p>He had started like a lightning express. He slowed <lb/>
down, and we glided over the sand slower, but still in <lb/>
a kind of sickening way; for it <i>is</i> uncomfortable to see <lb/>
things sliding and gliding under you like that, and not <lb/>
a sound.</p>
<p>But pretty soon there was plenty of sound, for the <lb/>
lion was catching up. His noise fetched others. You <lb/>
could see them coming on the lope from every direc- <lb/>
tion, and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of <lb/>
them under me, jumping up at the ladder and snarling <lb/>
and snapping at each other; and so we went skimming <lb/>
along over the sand, and these fellers doing what they <lb/>
could to help us to not forgit the occasion; and then <lb/>
some other beasts come, without an invite, and they <lb/>
started a regular riot down there.</p>
<p>We see this plan was a mistake. We couldn't ever <lb/>
git away from them at this gait, and I couldn't hold on <lb/>
forever. So Tom took a think, and struck another <lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
idea. That was, to kill a lion with the pepper-box <lb/>
revolver, and then sail away while the others stopped <lb/>
to fight over the carcass. So he stopped the balloon <lb/>
still, and done it, and then we sailed off while the fuss <lb/>
was going on, and come down a quarter of a mile off, <lb/>
and they helped me aboard; but by the time we was <lb/>
out of reach again, that gang was on hand once more. <lb/>
And when they see we was really gone and they <lb/>
couldn't get us, they sat down on their hams and <lb/>
looked up at us so kind of disappointed that it was as <lb/>
much as a person could do not to see <i>their</i> side of the <lb/>
matter.</p>

<head><smcap>it's a caravan</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>I was</smcap> so weak that the only thing I wanted was a <lb/>
chance to lay down, so I made straight for my <lb/>
locker-bunk, and stretched myself out there. But a <lb/>
body couldn't get back his strength in no such oven as <lb/>
that, so Tom give the command to soar, and Jim <lb/>
started her aloft.</p>
<p>We had to go up a mile before we struck comfort- <lb/>
able weather where it was breezy and pleasant and just <lb/>
right, and pretty soon I was all straight again. Tom <lb/>
had been setting quiet and thinking; but now he jumps <lb/>
up and says:</p>
<p>"I bet you a thousand to one <i>I</i> know where we are. <lb/>
We're in the Great Sahara, as sure as guns!"</p>
<p>He was so excited he couldn't hold still; but I <lb/>
wasn't. I says:</p>
<p>"Well, then, where's the Great Sahara? In Eng- <lb/>
land or in Scotland?"</p>
<p>"'Tain't in either; it's in Africa."</p>
<p>Jim's eyes bugged out, and he begun to stare down <lb/>
with no end of interest, because that was where his <lb/>
originals come from; but I didn't more than half be- <lb/>
<pb n="55"/>
lieve it. I couldn't, you know; it seemed too awful <lb/>
far away for us to have traveled.</p>
<p>But Tom was full of his discovery, as he called it, <lb/>
and said the lions and the sand meant the Great Desert, <lb/>
sure. He said he could 'a' found out, before we <lb/>
sighted land, that we was crowding the land some- <lb/>
wheres, if he had thought of one thing; and when we <lb/>
asked him what, he said:</p>
<p>"These clocks. They're chronometers. You al- <lb/>
ways read about them in sea voyages. One of them <lb/>
is keeping Grinnage time, and the other is keeping St. <lb/>
Louis time, like my watch. When we left St. Louis it <lb/>
was four in the afternoon by my watch and this clock, <lb/>
and it was ten at night by this Grinnage clock. Well, <lb/>
at this time of the year the sun sets at about seven <lb/>
o'clock. Now I noticed the time yesterday evening <lb/>
when the sun went down, and it was half-past five <lb/>
o'clock by the Grinnage clock, and half past 11 <smcap>a. m.</smcap> <lb/>
by my watch and the other clock. You see, the sun <lb/>
rose and set by my watch in St. Louis, and the Grin- <lb/>
nage clock was six hours fast; but we've come so far <lb/>
east that it comes within less than half an hour of set- <lb/>
ting by the Grinnage clock now, and I'm away out&#x2014; <lb/>
more than four hours and a half out. You see, that <lb/>
meant that we was closing up on the longitude of <lb/>
Ireland, and would strike it before long if we was <lb/>
p'inted right&#x2014;which we wasn't. No, sir, we've been <lb/>
a-wandering&#x2014;wandering 'way down south of east, and <lb/>
it's my opinion we are in Africa. Look at this map. <lb/>
You see how the shoulder of Africa sticks out to the <lb/>
<pb n="56"/>
west. Think how fast we've traveled; if we had gone <lb/>
straight east we would be long past England by this <lb/>
time. You watch for noon, all of you, and we'll stand <lb/>
up, and when we can't cast a shadow we'll find that <lb/>
this Grinnage clock is coming mighty close to marking <lb/>
twelve. Yes, sir, <i>I</i> think we're in Africa; and it's just <lb/>
bully."</p>
<p>Jim was gazing down with the glass. He shook his <lb/>
head and says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, I reckon dey's a mistake som'er's. I <lb/>
hain't seen no niggers yit."</p>
<p>"That's nothing; they don't live in the desert. <lb/>
What is that, 'way off yonder? Gimme a glass."</p>
<p>He took a long look, and said it was like a black <lb/>
string stretched across the sand, but he couldn't guess <lb/>
what it was.</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "I reckon maybe you've got a <lb/>
chance now to find out whereabouts this balloon is, <lb/>
because as like as not that is one of these lines here, <lb/>
that's on the map, that you call meridians of longi- <lb/>
tude, and we can drop down and look at its number, <lb/>
and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, I never see such a lunk- <lb/>
head as you. Did you s'pose there's meridians of <lb/>
longitude on the <i>earth?</i>"</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, they're set down on the map, and <lb/>
you know it perfectly well, and here they are, and you <lb/>
can see for yourself."</p>
<p>"Of course they're on the map, but that's nothing; <lb/>
there ain't any on the <i>ground</i>."</p>
<pb n="57"/>
<p>"Tom, do you know that to be so?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I do."</p>
<p>"Well, then, that map's a liar again. I never see <lb/>
such a liar as that map."</p>
<p>He fired up at that, and I was ready for him, and <lb/>
Jim was warming his opinion, too, and next minute <lb/>
we'd 'a' broke loose on another argument, if Tom <lb/>
hadn't dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands <lb/>
like a maniac and sing out:</p>
<p>"Camels!&#x2014;Camels!"</p>
<p>So I grabbed a glass and Jim, too, and took a look, <lb/>
but I was disappointed, and says:</p>
<p>"Camels your granny; they're spiders."</p>
<p>"Spiders in a desert, you shad? Spiders walking <lb/>
in a procession? You don't ever reflect, Huck Finn, <lb/>
and I reckon you really haven't got anything to <lb/>
reflect <i>with</i>. Don't you know we're as much as a <lb/>
mile up in the air, and that that string of crawlers is <lb/>
two or three miles away? Spiders, good land! Spiders <lb/>
as big as a cow? Perhaps you'd like to go down <lb/>
and milk one of 'em. But they're camels, just the <lb/>
same. It's a caravan, that's what it is, and it's a mile <lb/>
long."</p>
<p>"Well, then, let's go down and look at it. I <lb/>
don't believe in it, and ain't going to till I see it and <lb/>
know it."</p>
<p>"All right," he says, and give the command: <lb/>
"Lower away."</p>
<p>As we come slanting down into the hot weather, we <lb/>
could see that it was camels, sure enough, plodding <lb/>
<pb n="58"/>
along, an everlasting string of them, with bales strapped <lb/>
to them, and several hundred men in long white robes, <lb/>
and a thing like a shawl bound over their heads and <lb/>
hanging down with tassels and fringes; and some of <lb/>
the men had long guns and some hadn't, and some <lb/>
was riding and some was walking. And the weather&#x2014; <lb/>
well, it was just roasting. And how slow they did <lb/>
creep along! We swooped down now, all of a <lb/>
sudden, and stopped about a hundred yards over their <lb/>
heads.</p>
<p>The men all set up a yell, and some of them fell flat <lb/>
on their stomachs, some begun to fire their guns at us, <lb/>
and the rest broke and scampered every which way, <lb/>
and so did the camels.</p>
<p>We see that we was making trouble, so we went up <lb/>
again about a mile, to the cool weather, and watched <lb/>
them from there. It took them an hour to get together <lb/>
and form the procession again; then they started along, <lb/>
but we could see by the glasses that they wasn't pay- <lb/>
ing much attention to anything but us. We poked <lb/>
along, looking down at them with the glasses, and by <lb/>
and by we see a big sand mound, and something like <lb/>
people the other side of it, and there was something <lb/>
like a man laying on top of the mound that raised his <lb/>
head up every now and then, and seemed to be watch- <lb/>
ing the caravan or us, we didn't know which. As the <lb/>
caravan got nearer, he sneaked down on the other side <lb/>
and rushed to the other men and horses&#x2014;for that is <lb/>
what they was&#x2014;and we see them mount in a hurry; <lb/>
and next, here they come, like a house afire, some with <lb/>
<pb n="59"/>
lances and some with long guns, and all of them yell- <lb/>
ing the best they could.</p>
<p>They come a-tearing down on to the caravan, and the <lb/>
next minute both sides crashed together and was all <lb/>
mixed up, and there was such another popping of guns <lb/>
as you never heard, and the air got so full of smoke <lb/>
you could only catch glimpses of them struggling <lb/>
together. There must 'a' been six hundred men in <lb/>
that battle, and it was terrible to see. Then they <lb/>
broke up into gangs and groups, fighting tooth and <lb/>
nail, and scurrying and scampering around, and laying <lb/>
into each other like everything; and whenever the <lb/>
smoke cleared a little you could see dead and wounded <lb/>
people and camels scattered far and wide and all about, <lb/>
and camels racing off in every direction.</p>
<p>At last the robbers see they couldn't win, so their <lb/>
chief sounded a signal, and all that was left of them <lb/>
broke away and went scampering across the plain. <lb/>
The last man to go snatched up a child and carried it <lb/>
off in front of him on his horse, and a woman run <lb/>
screaming and begging after him, and followed him <lb/>
away off across the plain till she was separated a long <lb/>
ways from her people; but it warn't no use, and she <lb/>
had to give it up, and we see her sink down on the <lb/>
sand and cover her face with her hands. Then Tom <lb/>
took the hellum, and started for that yahoo, and we <lb/>
come a-whizzing down and made a swoop, and knocked <lb/>
him out of the saddle, child and all; and he was jarred <lb/>
considerable, but the child wasn't hurt, but laid there <lb/>
working its hands and legs in the air like a tumble-bug <lb/>
<pb n="60"/>
that's on its back and can't turn over. The man went <lb/>
staggering off to overtake his horse, and didn't know <lb/>
what had hit him, for we was three or four hundred <lb/>
yards up in the air by this time.</p>
<p>We judged the woman would go and get the child <lb/>
now; but she didn't. We could see her, through the <lb/>
glass, still setting there, with her head bowed down on <lb/>
her knees; so of course she hadn't seen the perform- <lb/>
ance, and thought her child was clean gone with the <lb/>
man. She was nearly a half a mile from her people, <lb/>
so we thought we might go down to the child, which <lb/>
was about a quarter of a mile beyond her, and snake <lb/>
it to her before the caravan people could git to us to <lb/>
do us any harm; and besides, we reckoned they had <lb/>
enough business on their hands for one while, anyway, <lb/>
with the wounded. We thought we'd chance it, and <lb/>
we did. We swooped down and stopped, and Jim <lb/>
shinned down the ladder and fetched up the kid, which <lb/>
was a nice fat little thing, and in a noble good humor, <lb/>
too, considering it was just out of a battle and been <lb/>
tumbled off of a horse; and then we started for the <lb/>
mother, and stopped back of her and tolerable near <lb/>
by, and Jim slipped down and crept up easy, and when <lb/>
he was close back of her the child goo-goo'd, the way <lb/>
a child does, and she heard it, and whirled and fetched <lb/>
a shriek of joy, and made a jump for the kid and <lb/>
snatched it and hugged it, and dropped it and hugged <lb/>
Jim, and then snatched off a gold chain and hung it <lb/>
around Jim's neck, and hugged him again, and jerked <lb/>
up the child again, a-sobbing and glorifying all the <lb/>
<pb n="61"/>
time; and Jim he shoved for the ladder and up it, and <lb/>
in a minute we was back up in the sky and the woman <lb/>
was staring up, with the back of her head between her <lb/>
shoulders and the child with its arms locked around <lb/>
her neck. And there she stood, as long as we was in <lb/>
sight a-sailing away in the sky.</p>

<head><smcap>tom respects the flea</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>"Noon</smcap>!" says Tom, and so it was. His shadder <lb/>
was just a blot around his feet. We looked, <lb/>
and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the <lb/>
difference didn't amount to nothing. So Tom said <lb/>
London was right north of us or right south of us, one <lb/>
or t'other, and he reckoned by the weather and the <lb/>
sand and the camels it was north; and a good many <lb/>
miles north, too; as many as from New York to the <lb/>
city of Mexico, he guessed.</p>
<p>Jim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the <lb/>
fastest thing in the world, unless it might be some <lb/>
kinds of birds&#x2014;a wild pigeon, maybe, or a railroad.</p>
<p>But Tom said he had read about railroads in England <lb/>
going nearly a hundred miles an hour for a little ways, <lb/>
and there never was a bird in the world that could do <lb/>
that&#x2014;except one, and that was a flea.</p>
<p>"A flea? Why, Mars Tom, in de fust place he <lb/>
ain't a bird, strickly speakin'&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"He ain't a bird, eh? Well, then, what is he?"</p>
<p>"I don't rightly know, Mars Tom, but I speck he's <lb/>
only jist a' animal. No, I reckon dat won't do, nuther, <lb/>
<pb n="63"/>
he ain't big enough for a' animal. He mus' be a bug. <lb/>
Yassir, dat's what he is, he's a bug."</p>
<p>"I bet he ain't, but let it go. What's your second <lb/>
place?"</p>
<p>"Well, in de second place, birds is creturs dat goes <lb/>
a long ways, but a flea don't."</p>
<p>"He don't, don't he? Come, now, what <i>is</i> a long <lb/>
distance, if you know?"</p>
<p>"Why, it's miles, and lots of 'em&#x2014;anybody knows <lb/>
dat."</p>
<p>"Can't a man walk miles?"</p>
<p>"Yassir, he kin."</p>
<p>"As many as a railroad?"</p>
<p>"Yassir, if you give him time."</p>
<p>"Can't a flea?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;I s'pose so&#x2014;ef you gives him heaps of <lb/>
time."</p>
<p>"Now you begin to see, don't you, that <i>distance</i> <lb/>
ain't the thing to judge by, at all; it's the time it takes <lb/>
to go the distance <i>in</i> that <i>counts</i>, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Well, hit do look sorter so, but I wouldn't 'a' <lb/>
b'lieved it, Mars Tom."</p>
<p>"It's a matter of <i>proportion</i>, that's what it is; and <lb/>
when you come to gauge a thing's speed by its size, <lb/>
where's your bird and your man and your railroad, <lb/>
alongside of a flea? The fastest man can't run more <lb/>
than about ten miles in an hour&#x2014;not much over ten <lb/>
thousand times his own length. But all the books says <lb/>
any common ordinary third-class flea can jump a hun- <lb/>
dred and fifty times his own length; yes, and he can <lb/>
<pb n="64"/>
make five jumps a second too&#x2014;seven hundred and <lb/>
fifty times his own length, in one little second&#x2014;for he <lb/>
don't fool away any time stopping and starting&#x2014;he <lb/>
does them both at the same time; you'll see, if you <lb/>
try to put your finger on him. Now that's a common, <lb/>
ordinary, third-class flea's gait; but you take an Eye- <lb/>
talian <i>first</i>-class, that's been the pet of the nobility all <lb/>
his life, and hasn't ever knowed what want or sickness <lb/>
or exposure was, and he can jump more than three <lb/>
hundred times his own length, and keep it up all day, <lb/>
five such jumps every second, which is fifteen hundred <lb/>
times his own length. Well, suppose a man could go <lb/>
fifteen hundred times his own length in a second&#x2014;say, <lb/>
a mile and a half. It's ninety miles a minute; it's <lb/>
considerable more than five thousand miles an hour. <lb/>
Where's your man <i>now?</i>&#x2014;yes, and your bird, and <lb/>
your railroad, and your balloon? Laws, they don't <lb/>
amount to shucks 'longside of a flea. A flea is just <lb/>
a comet b'iled down small."</p>
<p>Jim was a good deal astonished, and so was I. Jim <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Is dem figgers jist edjackly true, en no jokin' en <lb/>
no lies, Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they are; they're perfectly true."</p>
<p>"Well, den, honey, a body's got to respec' a flea. <lb/>
I ain't had no respec' for um befo', sca'sely, but dey <lb/>
ain't no gittin' roun' it, dey do deserve it, dat's <lb/>
certain."</p>
<p>"Well, I bet they do. They've got ever so much <lb/>
more sense, and brains, and brightness, in proportion <lb/>
<pb n="65"/>
to their size, than any other cretur in the world. A <lb/>
person can learn them 'most anything; and they learn <lb/>
it quicker than any other cretur, too. They've been <lb/>
learnt to haul little carriages in harness, and go this <lb/>
way and that way and t'other way according to their <lb/>
orders; yes, and to march and drill like soldiers, doing <lb/>
it as exact, according to orders, as soldiers does it. <lb/>
They've been learnt to do all sorts of hard and <lb/>
troublesome things. S'pose you could cultivate a flea <lb/>
up to the size of a man, and keep his natural <lb/>
smartness a-growing and a-growing right along up, <lb/>
bigger and bigger, and keener and keener, in the same <lb/>
proportion&#x2014;where'd the human race be, do you <lb/>
reckon? That flea would be President of the United <lb/>
States, and you couldn't any more prevent it than you <lb/>
can prevent lightning."</p>
<p>"My lan', Mars Tom, I never knowed dey was so <lb/>
much <i>to</i> de beas'. No, sir, I never had no idea of it, <lb/>
and dat's de fac'."</p>
<p>"There's more to him, by a long sight, than there <lb/>
is to any other cretur, man or beast, in proportion to <lb/>
size. He's the interestingest of them all. People have <lb/>
so much to say about an ant's strength, and an ele- <lb/>
phant's, and a locomotive's. Shucks, they don't begin <lb/>
with a flea. He can lift two or three hundred times his <lb/>
own weight. And none of them can come anywhere <lb/>
near it. And, moreover, he has got notions of his <lb/>
own, and is very particular, and you can't fool him; <lb/>
his instinct, or his judgment, or whatever it is, is per- <lb/>
fectly sound and clear, and don't ever make a mistake. <lb/>
<pb n="66"/>
People think all humans are alike to a flea. It ain't <lb/>
so. There's folks that he won't go near, hungry or <lb/>
not hungry, and I'm one of them. I've never had one <lb/>
of them on me in my life."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom!"</p>
<p>"It's so; I ain't joking."</p>
<p>"Well, sah, I hain't ever heard de likes o' dat befo'."</p>
<p>Jim couldn't believe it, and I couldn't; so we had to <lb/>
drop down to the sand and git a supply and see. Tom <lb/>
was right. They went for me and Jim by the thou- <lb/>
sand, but not a one of them lit on Tom. There warn't <lb/>
no explaining it, but there it was and there warn't no <lb/>
getting around it. He said it had always been just so, <lb/>
and he'd just as soon be where there was a million of <lb/>
them as not; they'd never touch him nor bother <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>We went up to the cold weather to freeze 'em out, <lb/>
and stayed a little spell, and then come back to the <lb/>
comfortable weather and went lazying along twenty or <lb/>
twenty-five miles an hour, the way we'd been doing for <lb/>
the last few hours. The reason was, that the longer <lb/>
we was in that solemn, peaceful desert, the more the <lb/>
hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down in us, and <lb/>
the more happier and contented and satisfied we got to <lb/>
feeling, and the more we got to liking the desert, and <lb/>
then loving it. So we had cramped the speed down, <lb/>
as I was saying, and was having a most noble good <lb/>
lazy time, sometimes watching through the glasses, <lb/>
sometimes stretched out on the lockers reading, some- <lb/>
times taking a nap.</p>
<pb n="67"/>
<p>It didn't seem like we was the same lot that was in <lb/>
such a state to find land and git ashore, but it was. <lb/>
But we had got over that&#x2014;clean over it. We was <lb/>
used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and <lb/>
didn't want to be anywheres else. Why, it seemed <lb/>
just like home; it 'most seemed as if I had been born <lb/>
and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the same. And <lb/>
always I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging <lb/>
at me, and pestering of me, and scolding, and finding <lb/>
fault, and fussing and bothering, and sticking to me, <lb/>
and keeping after me, and making me do this, and <lb/>
making me do that and t'other, and always selecting <lb/>
out the things I didn't want to do, and then giving me <lb/>
Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else, <lb/>
and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time; <lb/>
but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and <lb/>
lovely, and plenty to eat, and plenty of sleep, and <lb/>
strange things to see, and no nagging and no pester- <lb/>
ing, and no good people, and just holiday all the time. <lb/>
Land, I warn't in no hurry to git out and buck at <lb/>
civilization again. Now, one of the worst things about <lb/>
civilization is, that anybody that gits a letter with <lb/>
trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes <lb/>
you feel bad, and the newspapers fetches you the <lb/>
troubles of everybody all over the world, and keeps <lb/>
you downhearted and dismal 'most all the time, and <lb/>
it's such a heavy load for a person. I hate them <lb/>
newspapers; and I hate letters; and if I had my way <lb/>
I wouldn't allow nobody to load his troubles on to <lb/>
other folks he ain't acquainted with, on t'other side of <lb/>
<pb n="68"/>
the world, that way. Well, up in a balloon there ain't <lb/>
any of that, and it's the darlingest place there is.</p>
<p>We had supper, and that night was one of the <lb/>
prettiest nights I ever see. The moon made it just <lb/>
like daylight, only a heap softer; and once we see a <lb/>
lion standing all alone by himself, just all alone on the <lb/>
earth, it seemed like, and his shadder laid on the sand <lb/>
by him like a puddle of ink. That's the kind of moon- <lb/>
light to have.</p>
<p>Mainly we laid on our backs and talked; we didn't <lb/>
want to go to sleep. Tom said we was right in the <lb/>
midst of the Arabian Nights now. He said it was right <lb/>
along here that one of the cutest things in that book <lb/>
happened; so we looked down and watched while he <lb/>
told about it, because there ain't anything that is so <lb/>
interesting to look at as a place that a book has talked <lb/>
about. It was a tale about a camel-driver that had lost <lb/>
his camel, and he come along in the desert and met a <lb/>
man, and says:</p>
<p>"Have you run across a stray camel to-day?"</p>
<p>And the man says:</p>
<p>"Was he blind in his left eye?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Had he lost an upper front tooth?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Was his off hind leg lame?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Was he loaded with millet-seed on one side and <lb/>
honey on the other?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but you needn't go into no more details&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="69"/>
that's the one, and I'm in a hurry. Where did you <lb/>
see him?"</p>
<p>"I hain't seen him at all," the man says.</p>
<p>"Hain't seen him at all? How can you describe <lb/>
him so close, then?"</p>
<p>"Because when a person knows how to use his eyes, <lb/>
everything has got a meaning to it; but most people's <lb/>
eyes ain't any good to them. I knowed a camel had <lb/>
been along, because I seen his track. I knowed he <lb/>
was lame in his off hind leg because he had favored <lb/>
that foot and trod light on it, and his track showed it. <lb/>
I knowed he was blind on his left side because he only <lb/>
nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail. I <lb/>
knowed he had lost an upper front tooth because where <lb/>
he bit into the sod his teeth-print showed it. The <lb/>
millet-seed sifted out on one side&#x2014;the ants told me <lb/>
that; the honey leaked out on the other&#x2014;the flies <lb/>
told me that. I know all about your camel, but I <lb/>
hain't seen him."</p>
<p>Jim says:</p>
<p>"Go on, Mars Tom, hit's a mighty good tale, and <lb/>
powerful interestin'."</p>
<p>"That's all," Tom says.</p>
<p>"<i>All?</i>" says Jim, astonished. "What 'come o' <lb/>
de camel?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, don't de tale say?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Jim puzzled a minute, then he says:</p>
<p>"Well! Ef dat ain't de beatenes' tale ever <i>I</i> struck. <lb/>
<pb n="70"/>
Jist gits to de place whah de intrust is gittin' red-hot, <lb/>
en down she breaks. Why, Mars Tom, dey ain't no <lb/>
<i>sense</i> in a tale dat acts like dat. Hain't you got no <lb/>
<i>idea</i> whether de man got de camel back er not?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't."</p>
<p>I see myself there warn't no sense in the tale, to <lb/>
chop square off that way before it come to anything, <lb/>
but I warn't going to say so, because I could see Tom <lb/>
was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out <lb/>
and the way Jim had popped on to the weak place in <lb/>
it, and I don't think it's fair for everybody to pile on <lb/>
to a feller when he's down. But Tom he whirls on <lb/>
me and says:</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> think of the tale?"</p>
<p>Of course, then, I had to come out and make a clean <lb/>
breast and say it did seem to me, too, same as it did <lb/>
to Jim, that as long as the tale stopped square in the <lb/>
middle and never got to no place, it really warn't <lb/>
worth the trouble of telling.</p>
<p>Tom's chin dropped on his breast, and 'stead of <lb/>
being mad, as I reckoned he'd be, to hear me scoff at <lb/>
his tale that way, he seemed to be only sad; and he <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"Some people can see, and some can't&#x2014;just as <lb/>
that man said. Let alone a camel, if a cyclone had <lb/>
gone by, <i>you</i> duffers wouldn't 'a' noticed the <lb/>
track."</p>
<p>I don't know what he meant by that, and he didn't <lb/>
say; it was just one of his irrulevances, I reckon&#x2014;he <lb/>
was full of them, sometimes, when he was in a close <lb/>
<pb n="71"/>
place and couldn't see no other way out&#x2014;but I didn't <lb/>
mind. We'd spotted the soft place in that tale sharp <lb/>
enough, he couldn't git away from that little fact. It <lb/>
graveled him like the nation, too, I reckon, much as <lb/>
he tried not to let on.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the disappearing lake</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> had an early breakfast in the morning, and set <lb/>
looking down on the desert, and the weather <lb/>
was ever so bammy and lovely, although we warn't <lb/>
high up. You have to come down lower and lower <lb/>
after sundown in the desert, because it cools off so <lb/>
fast; and so, by the time it is getting toward dawn, <lb/>
you are skimming along only a little ways above the <lb/>
sand.</p>
<p>We was watching the shadder of the balloon slide <lb/>
along the ground, and now and then gazing off across <lb/>
the desert to see if anything was stirring, and then <lb/>
down on the shadder again, when all of a sudden <lb/>
almost right under us we see a lot of men and camels <lb/>
laying scattered about, perfectly quiet, like they was <lb/>
asleep.</p>
<p>We shut off the power, and backed up and stood <lb/>
over them, and then we see that they was all dead. It <lb/>
give us the cold shivers. And it made us hush down, <lb/>
too, and talk low, like people at a funeral. We <lb/>
dropped down slow and stopped, and me and Tom <lb/>
clumb down and went among them. There was men, <lb/>
<pb n="73"/>
and women, and children. They was dried by the sun <lb/>
and dark and shriveled and leathery, like the pictures <lb/>
of mummies you see in books. And yet they looked <lb/>
just as human, you wouldn't 'a' believed it; just like <lb/>
they was asleep.</p>
<p>Some of the people and animals was partly covered <lb/>
with sand, but most of them not, for the sand was <lb/>
thin there, and the bed was gravel and hard. Most <lb/>
of the clothes had rotted away; and when you took <lb/>
hold of a rag, it tore with a touch, like spider- <lb/>
web. Tom reckoned they had been laying there for <lb/>
years.</p>
<p>Some of the men had rusty guns by them, some had <lb/>
swords on and had shawl belts with long, silver- <lb/>
mounted pistols stuck in them. All the camels had <lb/>
their loads on yet, but the packs had busted or rotted <lb/>
and spilt the freight out on the ground. We didn't <lb/>
reckon the swords was any good to the dead people <lb/>
any more, so we took one apiece, and some pistols. <lb/>
We took a small box, too, because it was so handsome <lb/>
and inlaid so fine; and then we wanted to bury the <lb/>
people; but there warn't no way to do it that we could <lb/>
think of, and nothing to do it with but sand, and that <lb/>
would blow away again, of course.</p>
<p>Then we mounted high and sailed away, and pretty <lb/>
soon that black spot on the sand was out of sight, and <lb/>
we wouldn't ever see them poor people again in this <lb/>
world. We wondered, and reasoned, and tried to <lb/>
guess how they come to be there, and how it all hap- <lb/>
pened to them, but we couldn't make it out. First we <lb/>
<pb n="74"/>
thought maybe they got lost, and wandered around and <lb/>
about till their food and water give out and they <lb/>
starved to death; but Tom said no wild animals nor <lb/>
vultures hadn't meddled with them, and so that guess <lb/>
wouldn't do. So at last we give it up, and judged we <lb/>
wouldn't think about it no more, because it made us <lb/>
low-spirited.</p>
<p>Then we opened the box, and it had gems and jewels <lb/>
in it, quite a pile, and some little veils of the kind the <lb/>
dead women had on, with fringes made out of curious <lb/>
gold money that we warn't acquainted with. We <lb/>
wondered if we better go and try to find them again <lb/>
and give it back; but Tom thought it over and said <lb/>
no, it was a country that was full of robbers, and they <lb/>
would come and steal it; and then the sin would be on <lb/>
us for putting the temptation in their way. So we <lb/>
went on; but I wished we had took all they had, so <lb/>
there wouldn't 'a' been no temptation at all left.</p>
<p>We had had two hours of that blazing weather down <lb/>
there, and was dreadful thirsty when we got aboard <lb/>
again. We went straight for the water, but it was <lb/>
spoiled and bitter, besides being pretty near hot enough <lb/>
to scald your mouth. We couldn't drink it. It was <lb/>
Mississippi river water, the best in the world, and we <lb/>
stirred up the mud in it to see if that would help, but <lb/>
no, the mud wasn't any better than the water.</p>
<p>Well, we hadn't been so very, very thirsty before, <lb/>
while we was interested in the lost people, but we was <lb/>
now, and as soon as we found we couldn't have a <lb/>
drink, we was more than thirty-five times as thirsty as <lb/>
<pb n="75"/>
we was a quarter of a minute before. Why, in a little <lb/>
while we wanted to hold our mouths open and pant <lb/>
like a dog.</p>
<p>Tom said to keep a sharp lookout, all around, every- <lb/>
wheres, because we'd got to find an oasis or there <lb/>
warn't no telling what would happen. So we done it. <lb/>
We kept the glasses gliding around all the time, till our <lb/>
arms got so tired we couldn't hold them any more. <lb/>
Two hours&#x2014;three hours&#x2014;just gazing and gazing, <lb/>
and nothing but sand, sand, <i>sand</i>, and you could see <lb/>
the quivering heat-shimmer playing over it. Dear, <lb/>
dear, a body don't know what real misery is till he is <lb/>
thirsty all the way through and is certain he ain't ever <lb/>
going to come to any water any more. At last I <lb/>
couldn't stand it to look around on them baking plains; <lb/>
I laid down on the locker, and give it up.</p>
<p>But by and by Tom raised a whoop, and there she <lb/>
was! A lake, wide and shiny, with pa'm-trees leaning <lb/>
over it asleep, and their shadders in the water just as <lb/>
soft and delicate as ever you see. I never see anything <lb/>
look so good. It was a long ways off, but that <lb/>
warn't anything to us; we just slapped on a hundred- <lb/>
mile gait, and calculated to be there in seven minutes; <lb/>
but she stayed the same old distance away, all the <lb/>
time; we couldn't seem to gain on her; yes, sir, just as <lb/>
far, and shiny, and like a dream; but we couldn't get <lb/>
no nearer; and at last, all of a sudden, she was gone!</p>
<p>Tom's eyes took a spread, and he says:</p>
<p>"Boys, it was a <i>my</i>ridge!" Said it like he was <lb/>
glad. I didn't see nothing to be glad about. I says:</p>
<pb n="76"/>
<p>"Maybe. I don't care nothing about its name, the <lb/>
thing I want to know is, what's become of it?"</p>
<p>Jim was trembling all over, and so scared he couldn't <lb/>
speak, but he wanted to ask that question himself if he <lb/>
could 'a' done it. Tom says:</p>
<p>"What's <i>become</i> of it? Why, you see yourself it's <lb/>
gone."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know; but where's it gone <i>to?</i>"</p>
<p>He looked me over and says:</p>
<p>"Well, now, Huck Finn, where <i>would</i> it go to! <lb/>
Don't you know what a myridge is?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't. What is it?"</p>
<p>"It ain't anything but imagination. There ain't <lb/>
anything <i>to</i> it."</p>
<p>It warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that, <lb/>
and I says:</p>
<p>"What's the use you talking that kind of stuff, Tom <lb/>
Sawyer? Didn't I see the lake?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;you think you did."</p>
<p>"I don't think nothing about it, I <i>did</i> see it."</p>
<p>"I tell you you <i>didn't</i> see it either&#x2014;because it <lb/>
warn't there to see."</p>
<p>It astonished Jim to hear him talk so, and he broke <lb/>
in and says, kind of pleading and distressed:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, <i>please</i> don't say sich things in sich an <lb/>
awful time as dis. You ain't only reskin' yo' own <lb/>
self, but you's reskin' us&#x2014;same way like Anna Nias <lb/>
en Siffira. De lake <i>wuz</i> dah&#x2014;I seen it jis' as plain <lb/>
as I sees you en Huck dis minute."</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<pb n="77"/>
<p>"Why, he seen it himself! He was the very one <lb/>
that seen it first. <i>Now</i>, then!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mars Tom, hit's so&#x2014;you can't deny it. We <lb/>
all seen it, en dat <i>prove</i> it was dah."</p>
<p>"Proves it! <i>How</i> does it prove it?"</p>
<p>"Same way it does in de courts en everywheres, <lb/>
Mars Tom. One pusson might be drunk, or dreamy <lb/>
or suthin', en he could be mistaken; en two might, <lb/>
maybe; but I tell you, sah, when three sees a thing, <lb/>
drunk er sober, it's <i>so</i>. Dey ain't no gittin' aroun' <lb/>
dat, en you knows it, Mars Tom."</p>
<p>"I don't know nothing of the kind. There used to <lb/>
be forty thousand million people that seen the sun <lb/>
move from one side of the sky to the other every day. <lb/>
Did that prove that the sun <i>done</i> it?"</p>
<p>"Course it did. En besides, dey warn't no 'casion <lb/>
to prove it. A body 'at's got any sense ain't gwine to <lb/>
doubt it. Dah she is now&#x2014;a sailin' thoo de sky, <lb/>
like she allays done."</p>
<p>Tom turned on me, then, and says:</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> say&#x2014;is the sun standing still?"</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, what's the use to ask such a jackass <lb/>
question? Anybody that ain't blind can see it don't <lb/>
stand still."</p>
<p>"Well," he says, "I'm lost in the sky with no <lb/>
company but a passel of low-down animals that don't <lb/>
know no more than the head boss of a university did <lb/>
three or four hundred years ago."</p>
<p>It warn't fair play, and I let him know it. I <lb/>
says:</p>
<pb n="78"/>
<p>"Throwin' mud ain't arguin', Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>"Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness gracious, <lb/>
dah's de lake agi'n!" yelled Jim, just then. "<i>Now</i>, <lb/>
Mars Tom, what you gwine to say?"</p>
<p>Yes, sir, there was the lake again, away yonder <lb/>
across the desert, perfectly plain, trees and all, just <lb/>
the same as it was before. I says:</p>
<p>"I reckon you're satisfied now, Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>But he says, perfectly ca'm:</p>
<p>"Yes, satisfied there ain't no lake there."</p>
<p>Jim says:</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i> talk so, Mars Tom&#x2014;it sk'yers me to hear <lb/>
you. It's so hot, en you's so thirsty, dat you ain't in <lb/>
yo' right mine, Mars Tom. Oh, but don't she look <lb/>
good! 'clah I doan' know how I's gwine to wait tell <lb/>
we gits dah, I's <i>so</i> thirsty."</p>
<p>"Well, you'll have to wait; and it won't do you no <lb/>
good, either, because there ain't no lake there, I tell <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"Jim, don't you take your eye off of it, and I <lb/>
won't, either."</p>
<p>"'Deed I won't; en bless you, honey, I couldn't ef <lb/>
I wanted to."</p>
<p>We went a-tearing along toward it, piling the miles <lb/>
behind us like nothing, but never gaining an inch on it <lb/>
&#x2014;and all of a sudden it was gone again! Jim stag- <lb/>
gered, and 'most fell down. When he got his breath <lb/>
he says, gasping like a fish:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, hit's a <i>ghos</i>', dat's what it is, en I <lb/>
<pb n="79"/>
hopes to goodness we ain't gwine to see it no mo'. <lb/>
Dey's <i>been</i> a lake, en suthin's happened, en de lake's <lb/>
dead, en we's seen its ghos'; we's seen it twiste, en <lb/>
dat's proof. De desert's ha'nted, it's ha'nted, sho; <lb/>
oh, Mars Tom, le' 's git outen it; I'd ruther die den <lb/>
have de night ketch us in it ag'in en de ghos' er dat <lb/>
lake come a-mournin' aroun' us en we asleep en doan' <lb/>
know de danger we's in."</p>
<p>"Ghost, you gander! It ain't anything but air and <lb/>
heat and thirstiness pasted together by a person's <lb/>
imagination. If I&#x2014;gimme the glass!"</p>
<p>He grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right.</p>
<p>"It's a flock of birds," he says. "It's getting <lb/>
toward sundown, and they're making a bee-line across <lb/>
our track for somewheres. They mean business&#x2014; <lb/>
maybe they're going for food or water, or both. Let <lb/>
her go to starboard!&#x2014;Port your hellum! Hard down! <lb/>
There&#x2014;ease up&#x2014;steady, as you go."</p>
<p>We shut down some of the power, so as not to out- <lb/>
speed them, and took out after them. We went skim- <lb/>
ming along a quarter of a mile behind them, and when <lb/>
we had followed them an hour and a half and was get- <lb/>
ting pretty discouraged, and was thirsty clean to <lb/>
unendurableness, Tom says:</p>
<p>"Take the glass, one of you, and see what that is, <lb/>
away ahead of the birds."</p>
<p>Jim got the first glimpse, and slumped down on the <lb/>
locker sick. He was most crying, and says:</p>
<p>"She's dah ag'in, Mars Tom, she's dah ag'in, en I <lb/>
knows I's gwine to die, 'case when a body sees a ghos' <lb/>
<pb n="80"/>
de third time, dat's what it means. I wisht I'd never <lb/>
come in dis balloon, dat I does."</p>
<p>He wouldn't look no more, and what he said made <lb/>
me afraid, too, because I knowed it was true, for that <lb/>
has always been the way with ghosts; so then I <lb/>
wouldn't look any more, either. Both of us begged <lb/>
Tom to turn off and go some other way, but he <lb/>
wouldn't, and said we was ignorant superstitious <lb/>
blatherskites. Yes, and he'll git come up with, one <lb/>
of these days, I says to myself, insulting ghosts that <lb/>
way. They'll stand it for a while, maybe, but they <lb/>
won't stand it always, for anybody that knows about <lb/>
ghosts knows how easy they are hurt, and how revenge- <lb/>
ful they are.</p>
<p>So we was all quiet and still, Jim and me being <lb/>
scared, and Tom busy. By and by Tom fetched the <lb/>
balloon to a standstill, and says:</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i> get up and look, you sapheads."</p>
<p>We done it, and there was the sure-enough water <lb/>
right under us!&#x2014;clear, and blue, and cool, and deep, <lb/>
and wavy with the breeze, the loveliest sight that ever <lb/>
was. And all about it was grassy banks, and flowers, <lb/>
and shady groves of big trees, looped together with <lb/>
vines, and all looking so peaceful and comfortable&#x2014; <lb/>
enough to make a body cry, it was so beautiful.</p>
<p>Jim <i>did</i> cry, and rip and dance and carry on, he was <lb/>
so thankful and out of his mind for joy. It was my <lb/>
watch, so I had to stay by the works, but Tom and <lb/>
Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece, and <lb/>
fetched me up a lot, and I've tasted a many a good <lb/>
<pb n="81"/>
thing in my life, but nothing that ever begun with that <lb/>
water.</p>
<p>Then we went down and had a swim, and then Tom <lb/>
came up and spelled me, and me and Jim had a swim, <lb/>
and then Jim spelled Tom, and me and Tom had a <lb/>
foot-race and a boxing-mill, and I don't reckon I ever <lb/>
had such a good time in my life. It warn't so very <lb/>
hot, because it was close on to evening, and we hadn't <lb/>
any clothes on, anyway. Clothes is well enough in <lb/>
school, and in towns, and at balls, too, but there ain't <lb/>
no sense in them when there ain't no civilization nor <lb/>
other kinds of bothers and fussiness around.</p>
<p>"Lions a-comin'!&#x2014;lions! Quick, Mars Tom! <lb/>
Jump for yo' life, Huck!"</p>
<p>Oh, and didn't we! We never stopped for clothes, <lb/>
but waltzed up the ladder just so. Jim lost his head <lb/>
straight off&#x2014;he always done it whenever he got ex- <lb/>
cited and scared; and so now, 'stead of just easing the <lb/>
ladder up from the ground a little, so the animals <lb/>
couldn't reach it, he turned on a raft of power, and we <lb/>
went whizzing up and was dangling in the sky before <lb/>
he got his wits together and seen what a foolish thing <lb/>
he was doing. Then he stopped her, but he had clean <lb/>
forgot what to do next; so there we was, so high that <lb/>
the lions looked like pups, and we was drifting off on <lb/>
the wind.</p>
<p>But Tom he shinned up and went for the works and <lb/>
begun to slant her down, and back toward the lake, <lb/>
where the animals was gathering like a camp-meeting, <lb/>
and I judged he had lost <i>his</i> head, too; for he knowed <lb/>
<pb n="82"/>
I was too scared to climb, and did he want to dump <lb/>
me among the tigers and things?</p>
<p>But no, his head was level, he knowed what he was <lb/>
about. He swooped down to within thirty or forty <lb/>
feet of the lake, and stopped right over the center, and <lb/>
sung out:</p>
<p>"Leggo, and drop!"</p>
<p>I done it, and shot down, feet first, and seemed to <lb/>
go about a mile toward the bottom; and when I come <lb/>
up, he says:</p>
<p>"Now lay on your back and float till you're rested <lb/>
and got your pluck back, then I'll dip the ladder in <lb/>
the water and you can climb aboard."</p>
<p>I done it. Now that was ever so smart in Tom, be- <lb/>
cause if he had started off somewheres else to drop <lb/>
down on the sand, the menagerie would 'a' come <lb/>
along, too, and might 'a' kept us hunting a safe place <lb/>
till I got tuckered out and fell.</p>
<p>And all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out <lb/>
the clothes, and trying to divide them up so there <lb/>
would be some for all, but there was a misunderstand- <lb/>
ing about it somewheres, on account of some of them <lb/>
trying to hog more than their share; so there was <lb/>
another insurrection, and you never see anything like <lb/>
it in the world. There must 'a' been fifty of them, all <lb/>
mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping <lb/>
and biting and tearing, legs and tails in the air, and <lb/>
you couldn't tell which was which, and the sand and <lb/>
fur a-flying. And when they got done, some was <lb/>
dead, and some was limping off crippled, and the rest <lb/>
<pb n="83"/>
was setting around on the battlefield, some of them <lb/>
licking their sore places and the others looking up at <lb/>
us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down <lb/>
and have some fun, but which we didn't want any.</p>
<p>As for the clothes, they warn't any, any more. <lb/>
Every last rag of them was inside of the animals; and <lb/>
not agreeing with them very well, I don't reckon, for <lb/>
there was considerable many brass buttons on them, <lb/>
and there was knives in the pockets, too, and smoking <lb/>
tobacco, and nails and chalk and marbles and fish- <lb/>
hooks and things. But I wasn't caring. All that was <lb/>
bothering me was, that all we had now was the pro- <lb/>
fessor's clothes, a big enough assortment, but not suit- <lb/>
able to go into company with, if we came across any, <lb/>
because the britches was as long as tunnels, and the <lb/>
coats and things according. Still, there was everything <lb/>
a tailor needed, and Jim was a kind of jack-legged <lb/>
tailor, and he allowed he could soon trim a suit or two <lb/>
down for us that would answer.</p>

<head><smcap>tom discourses on the desert</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Still</smcap>, we thought we would drop down there a <lb/>
minute, but on another errand. Most of the pro- <lb/>
fessor's cargo of food was put up in cans, in the new <lb/>
way that somebody had just invented; the rest was <lb/>
fresh. When you fetch Missouri beefsteak to the <lb/>
Great Sahara, you want to be particular and stay up <lb/>
in the coolish weather. So we reckoned we would <lb/>
drop down into the lion market and see how we could <lb/>
make out there.</p>
<p>We hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we <lb/>
was just above the reach of the animals, then we let <lb/>
down a rope with a slip-knot in it and hauled up a <lb/>
dead lion, a small tender one, then yanked up a cub <lb/>
tiger. We had to keep the congregation off with the <lb/>
revolver, or they would 'a' took a hand in the proceed- <lb/>
ings and helped.</p>
<p>We carved off a supply from both, and saved the <lb/>
skins, and hove the rest overboard. Then we baited <lb/>
some of the professor's hooks with the fresh meat and <lb/>
went a-fishing. We stood over the lake just a con- <lb/>
venient distance above the water, and catched a lot of <lb/>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>"WE CATCHED FISH"</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="85"/>
the nicest fish you ever see. It was a most amazing <lb/>
good supper we had; lion steak, tiger steak, fried fish, <lb/>
and hot corn-pone. I don't want nothing better than <lb/>
that.</p>
<p>We had some fruit to finish off with. We got it out <lb/>
of the top of a monstrous tall tree. It was a very slim <lb/>
tree that hadn't a branch on it from the bottom plumb <lb/>
to the top, and there it bursted out like a feather- <lb/>
duster. It was a pa'm-tree, of course; anybody knows <lb/>
a pa'm-tree the minute he see it, by the pictures. We <lb/>
went for cocoanuts in this one, but there warn't none. <lb/>
There was only big loose bunches of things like over- <lb/>
sized grapes, and Tom allowed they was dates, because <lb/>
he said they answered the description in the Arabian <lb/>
Nights and the other books. Of course they mightn't <lb/>
be, and they might be poison; so we had to wait a <lb/>
spell, and watch and see if the birds et them. They <lb/>
done it; so we done it, too, and they was most amaz- <lb/>
ing good.</p>
<p>By this time monstrous big birds begun to come and <lb/>
settle on the dead animals. They was plucky creturs; <lb/>
they would tackle one end of a lion that was being <lb/>
gnawed at the other end by another lion. If the lion <lb/>
drove the bird away, it didn't do no good; he was <lb/>
back again the minute the lion was busy.</p>
<p>The big birds come out of every part of the sky&#x2014; <lb/>
you could make them out with the glass while they was <lb/>
still so far away you couldn't see them with your naked <lb/>
eye. Tom said the birds didn't find out the meat was <lb/>
there by the smell; they had to find it out by seeing <lb/>
<pb n="86"/>
it. Oh, but ain't that an eye for you! Tom said at <lb/>
the distance of five mile a patch of dead lions couldn't <lb/>
look any bigger than a person's finger-nail, and he <lb/>
couldn't imagine how the birds could notice such a <lb/>
little thing so far off.</p>
<p>It was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion, <lb/>
and we thought maybe they warn't kin. But Jim said <lb/>
that didn't make no difference. He said a hog was <lb/>
fond of her own children, and so was a spider, and he <lb/>
reckoned maybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled <lb/>
though maybe not quite. He thought likely a lion <lb/>
wouldn't eat his own father, if he knowed which was <lb/>
him, but reckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if <lb/>
he was uncommon hungry, and eat his mother-in-law <lb/>
any time. But <i>reckoning</i> don't settle nothing. You <lb/>
can reckon till the cows come home, but that don't <lb/>
fetch you to no decision. So we give it up and let it <lb/>
drop.</p>
<p>Generly it was very still in the Desert nights, but this <lb/>
time there was music. A lot of other animals come to <lb/>
dinner; sneaking yelpers that Tom allowed was jackals, <lb/>
and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas; and <lb/>
all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the <lb/>
time. They made a picture in the moonlight that was <lb/>
more different than any picture I ever see. We had a <lb/>
line out and made fast to the top of a tree, and didn't <lb/>
stand no watch, but all turned in and slept; but I was <lb/>
up two or three times to look down at the animals and <lb/>
hear the music. It was like having a front seat at a <lb/>
menagerie for nothing, which I hadn't ever had before, <lb/>
<pb n="87"/>
and so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make the <lb/>
most of it; I mightn't ever have such a chance <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>We went a-fishing again in the early dawn, and then <lb/>
lazied around all day in the deep shade on an island, <lb/>
taking turn about to watch and see that none of the <lb/>
animals come a-snooping around there after erronorts <lb/>
for dinner. We was going to leave the next day, but <lb/>
couldn't, it was too lovely.</p>
<p>The day after, when we rose up toward the sky and <lb/>
sailed off eastward, we looked back and watched that <lb/>
place till it warn't nothing but just a speck in the <lb/>
Desert, and I tell you it was like saying good-bye to a <lb/>
friend that you ain't ever going to see any more.</p>
<p>Jim was thinking to himself, and at last he says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, we's mos' to de end er de Desert now, <lb/>
I speck."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, hit stan' to reason we is. You knows how <lb/>
long we's been a-skimmin' over it. Mus' be mos' out <lb/>
o' san'. Hit's a wonder to me dat it's hilt out as long <lb/>
as it has."</p>
<p>"Shucks, there's plenty sand, you needn't worry."</p>
<p>"Oh, I ain't a-worryin', Mars Tom, only wonderin', <lb/>
dat's all. De Lord's got plenty san', I ain't doubtin' <lb/>
dat; but nemmine, He ain't gwyne to <i>was'e</i> it jist on <lb/>
dat account; en I allows dat dis Desert's plenty big <lb/>
enough now, jist de way she is, en you can't spread <lb/>
her out no mo' 'dout was'in' san'."</p>
<p>"Oh, go 'long! we ain't much more than fairly <lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
<i>started</i> across this Desert yet. The United States is a <lb/>
pretty big country, ain't it? Ain't it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I says, "there ain't no bigger one, I don't <lb/>
reckon."</p>
<p>"Well," he says, "this Desert is about the shape <lb/>
of the United States, and if you was to lay it down on <lb/>
top of the United States, it would cover the land of <lb/>
the free out of sight like a blanket. There'd be a little <lb/>
corner sticking out, up at Maine and away up north- <lb/>
west, and Florida sticking out like a turtle's tail, and <lb/>
that's all. We've took California away from the <lb/>
Mexicans two or three years ago, so that part of the <lb/>
Pacific coast is ours now, and if you laid the Great <lb/>
Sahara down with her edge on the Pacific, she would <lb/>
cover the United States and stick out past New York <lb/>
six hundred miles into the Atlantic ocean."</p>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>"Good land! have you got the documents for that, <lb/>
Tom Sawyer?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and they're right here, and I've been study- <lb/>
ing them. You can look for yourself. From New <lb/>
York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles. From one end of <lb/>
the Great Desert to the other is 3,200. The United <lb/>
States contains 3,600,000 square miles, the Desert <lb/>
contains 4,162,000. With the Desert's bulk you could <lb/>
cover up every last inch of the United States, and in <lb/>
under where the edges projected out, you could tuck <lb/>
England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Denmark, and all <lb/>
Germany. Yes, sir, you could hide the home of the <lb/>
brave and all of them countries clean out of sight under <lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
the Great Sahara, and you would still have 2,000 <lb/>
square miles of sand left."</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "it clean beats me. Why, Tom, <lb/>
it shows that the Lord took as much pains makin' this <lb/>
Desert as makin' the United States and all them other <lb/>
countries."</p>
<p>Jim says: "Huck, dat don' stan' to reason. I <lb/>
reckon dis Desert wa'n't made at all. Now you take <lb/>
en look at it like dis&#x2014;you look at it, and see ef I's <lb/>
right. What's a desert good for? 'Taint good for <lb/>
nuthin'. Dey ain't no way to make it pay. Hain't <lb/>
dat so, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Hain't it so, Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"I guess so. Go on."</p>
<p>"Ef a thing ain't no good, it's made in vain, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i>, den! Do de Lord make anything in vain? <lb/>
You answer me dat."</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;no, He don't."</p>
<p>"Den how come He make a desert?"</p>
<p>"Well, go on. How <i>did</i> He come to make it?"</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, <i>I</i> b'lieve it uz jes like when you's buildin' <lb/>
a house; dey's allays a lot o' truck en rubbish lef' over. <lb/>
What does you do wid it? Doan' you take en k'yart <lb/>
it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot? 'Course. <lb/>
Now, den, it's my opinion hit was jes like dat&#x2014;dat <lb/>
de Great Sahara warn't made at all, she jes <i>happen</i>'."</p>
<p>I said it was a real good argument, and I believed it <lb/>
was the best one Jim ever made. Tom he said the same, <lb/>
<pb n="90"/>
but said the trouble about arguments is, they ain't <lb/>
nothing but <i>theories</i>, after all, and theories don't prove <lb/>
nothing, they only give you a place to rest on, a spell, <lb/>
when you are tuckered out butting around and around <lb/>
trying to find out something there ain't no way <i>to</i> find <lb/>
out. And he says:</p>
<p>"There's another trouble about theories: there's <lb/>
always a hole in them somewheres, sure, if you look <lb/>
close enough. It's just so with this one of Jim's. <lb/>
Look what billions and billions of stars there is. How <lb/>
does it come that there was just exactly enough star- <lb/>
stuff, and none left over? How does it come there <lb/>
ain't no sand-pile up there?"</p>
<p>But Jim was fixed for him and says:</p>
<p>"What's de Milky Way?&#x2014;dat's what <i>I</i> want to <lb/>
know. What's de Milky Way? Answer me dat!"</p>
<p>In my opinion it was just a sockdologer. It's only <lb/>
an opinion, it's only <i>my</i> opinion and others may think <lb/>
different; but I said it then and I stand to it now&#x2014;it <lb/>
was a sockdologer. And moreover, besides, it landed <lb/>
Tom Sawyer. He couldn't say a word. He had that <lb/>
stunned look of a person that's been shot in the back <lb/>
with a kag of nails. All he said was, as for people <lb/>
like me and Jim, he'd just as soon have intellectual <lb/>
intercourse with a catfish. But anybody can say that <lb/>
&#x2014;and I notice they always do, when somebody has <lb/>
fetched them a lifter. Tom Sawyer was tired of that <lb/>
end of the subject.</p>
<p>So we got back to talking about the size of the <lb/>
Desert again, and the more we compared it with this <lb/>
<pb n="91"/>
and that and t'other thing, the more nobier and bigger <lb/>
and grander it got to look right along. And so, hunt- <lb/>
ing among the figgers, Tom found, by and by, that it <lb/>
was just the same size as the Empire of China. Then <lb/>
he showed us the spread the Empire of China made on <lb/>
the map, and the room she took up in the world. <lb/>
Well, it was wonderful to think of, and I says:</p>
<p>"Why, I've heard talk about this Desert plenty of <lb/>
times, but <i>I</i> never knowed before how important she <lb/>
was."</p>
<p>Then Tom says:</p>
<p>"Important! Sahara important! That's just the <lb/>
way with some people. If a thing's big, it's important. <lb/>
That's all the sense they've got. All they can see is <lb/>
<i>size</i>. Why, look at England. It's the most important <lb/>
country in the world; and yet you could put it in <lb/>
China's vest-pocket; and not only that, but you'd <lb/>
have the dickens's own time to find it again the next <lb/>
time you wanted it. And look at Russia. It spreads <lb/>
all around and everywhere, and yet ain't no more im- <lb/>
portant in this world than Rhode Island is, and hasn't <lb/>
got half as much in it that's worth saving."</p>
<p>Away off now we see a little hill, a-standing up just <lb/>
on the edge of the world. Tom broke off his talk, and <lb/>
reached for a glass very much excited, and took a look, <lb/>
and says:</p>
<p>"That's it&#x2014;it's the one I've been looking for, <lb/>
sure. If I'm right, it's the one the dervish took the <lb/>
man into and showed him all the treasures."</p>
<p>So we begun to gaze, and he begun to tell about it <lb/>
out of the Arabian Nights.</p>
</div3>

<head><b>CHAPTER X.</b></head>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the treasure-hill</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Tom</smcap> said it happened like this.</p>
<p>A dervish was stumping it along through the <lb/>
Desert, on foot, one blazing hot day, and he had come <lb/>
a thousand miles and was pretty poor, and hungry, <lb/>
and ornery and tired, and along about where we are <lb/>
now he run across a camel-driver with a hundred <lb/>
camels, and asked him for some a'ms. But the camel- <lb/>
driver he asked to be excused. The dervish said:</p>
<p>"Don't you own these camels?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they're mine."</p>
<p>"Are you in debt?"</p>
<p>"Who&#x2014;me? No."</p>
<p>"Well, a man that owns a hundred camels and ain't <lb/>
in debt is rich&#x2014;and not only rich, but very rich. <lb/>
Ain't it so?"</p>
<p>The camel-driver owned up that it was so. Then <lb/>
the dervish says:</p>
<p>"God has made you rich, and He has made me <lb/>
poor. He has His reasons, and they are wise, blessed <lb/>
be His name. But He has willed that His rich shall <lb/>
help His poor, and you have turned away from me, <lb/>
<pb n="93"/>
your brother, in my need, and He will remember this, <lb/>
and you will lose by it."</p>
<p>That made the camel-driver feel shaky, but all the <lb/>
same he was born hoggish after money and didn't like <lb/>
to let go a cent; so he begun to whine and explain, <lb/>
and said times was hard, and although he had took a <lb/>
full freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it, <lb/>
he couldn't git no return freight, and so he warn't <lb/>
making no great things out of his trip. So the dervish <lb/>
starts along again, and says:</p>
<p>"All right, if you want to take the risk; but I <lb/>
reckon you've made a mistake this time, and missed a <lb/>
chance."</p>
<p>Of course the camel-driver wanted to know what <lb/>
kind of a chance he had missed, because maybe there <lb/>
was money in it; so he run after the dervish, and <lb/>
begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him <lb/>
that at last the dervish gave in, and says:</p>
<p>"Do you see that hill yonder? Well, in that hill is <lb/>
all the treasures of the earth, and I was looking around <lb/>
for a man with a particular good kind heart and a <lb/>
noble, generous disposition, because if I could find just <lb/>
that man, I've got a kind of a salve I could put on <lb/>
his eyes and he could see the treasures and get them <lb/>
out."</p>
<p>So then the camel-driver was in a sweat; and he <lb/>
cried, and begged, and took on, and went down on his <lb/>
knees, and said he was just that kind of a man, and <lb/>
said he could fetch a thousand people that would say <lb/>
he wasn't ever described so exact before.</p>
<pb n="94"/>
<p>"Well, then," says the dervish, "all right. If we <lb/>
load the hundred camels, can I have half of them?"</p>
<p>The driver was so glad he couldn't hardly hold in, <lb/>
and says:</p>
<p>"Now you're shouting."</p>
<p>So they shook hands on the bargain, and the dervish <lb/>
got out his box and rubbed the salve on the driver's <lb/>
right eye, and the hill opened and he went in, and <lb/>
there, sure enough, was piles and piles of gold and <lb/>
jewels sparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down.</p>
<p>So him and the dervish laid into it, and they loaded <lb/>
every camel till he couldn't carry no more; then they <lb/>
said good-bye, and each of them started off with his <lb/>
fifty. But pretty soon the camel-driver come a-running <lb/>
and overtook the dervish and says:</p>
<p>"You ain't in society, you know, and you don't <lb/>
really need all you've got. Won't you be good, and <lb/>
let me have ten of your camels?"</p>
<p>"Well," the dervish says, "I don't know but what <lb/>
you say is reasonable enough."</p>
<p>So he done it, and they separated and the dervish <lb/>
started off again with his forty. But pretty soon here <lb/>
comes the camel-driver bawling after him again, and <lb/>
whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of <lb/>
him, saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough <lb/>
to see a dervish through, because they live very simple, <lb/>
you know, and don't keep house, but board around <lb/>
and give their note.</p>
<p>But that warn't the end yet. That ornery hound <lb/>
kept coming and coming till he had begged back all <lb/>
<pb n="95"/>
the camels and had the whole hundred. Then he was <lb/>
satisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn't <lb/>
ever forgit the dervish as long as he lived, and nobody <lb/>
hadn't been so good to him before, and liberal. So <lb/>
they shook hands good-bye, and separated and started <lb/>
off again.</p>
<p>But do you know, it warn't ten minutes till the <lb/>
camel-driver was unsatisfied again&#x2014;he was the low- <lb/>
downest reptyle in seven counties&#x2014;and he come a- <lb/>
running again. And this time the thing he wanted was <lb/>
to get the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other <lb/>
eye.</p>
<p>"Why?" said the dervish.</p>
<p>"Oh, you know," says the driver.</p>
<p>"Know what?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can't fool me," says the driver. <lb/>
"You're trying to keep back something from me, <lb/>
you know it mighty well. You know, I reckon, that <lb/>
if I had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot <lb/>
more things that's valuable. Come&#x2014;please put it on."</p>
<p>The dervish says:</p>
<p>"I wasn't keeping anything back from you. I <lb/>
don't mind telling you what would happen if I put it <lb/>
on. You'd never see again. You'd be stone-blind the <lb/>
rest of your days."</p>
<p>But do you know that beat wouldn't believe him. <lb/>
No, he begged and begged, and whined and cried, till <lb/>
at last the dervish opened his box and told him to put <lb/>
it on, if he wanted to. So the man done it, and sure <lb/>
enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute.</p>
<pb n="96"/>
<p>Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him <lb/>
and made fun of him; and says:</p>
<p>"Good-bye&#x2014;a man that's blind hain't got no use <lb/>
for jewelry."</p>
<p>And he cleared out with the hundred camels, and <lb/>
left that man to wander around poor and miserable and <lb/>
friendless the rest of his days in the Desert.</p>
<p>Jim said he'd bet it was a lesson to him.</p>
<p>"Yes," Tom says, "and like a considerable many <lb/>
lessons a body gets. They ain't no account, because <lb/>
the thing don't ever happen the same way again&#x2014;and <lb/>
can't. The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly <lb/>
and crippled his back for life, everybody said it would <lb/>
be a lesson to him. What kind of a lesson? How <lb/>
was he going to use it? He couldn't climb chimblies <lb/>
no more, and he hadn't no more backs to break."</p>
<p>"All de same, Mars Tom, dey <i>is</i> sich a thing as <lb/>
learnin' by expe'ence. De Good Book say de burnt <lb/>
chile shun de fire."</p>
<p>"Well, I ain't denying that a thing's a lesson if it's <lb/>
a thing that can happen twice just the same way. <lb/>
There's lots of such things, and <i>they</i> educate a person, <lb/>
that's what Uncle Abner always said; but there's forty <lb/>
<i>million</i> lots of the other kind&#x2014;the kind that don't <lb/>
happen the same way twice&#x2014;and they ain't no real <lb/>
use, they ain't no more instructive than the small-pox. <lb/>
When you've got it, it ain't no good to find out you <lb/>
ought to been vaccinated, and it ain't no good to git <lb/>
vaccinated afterward, because the small-pox don't <lb/>
come but once. But, on the other hand, Uncle Abner <lb/>
<pb n="97"/>
said that the person that had took a bull by the tail <lb/>
once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a <lb/>
person that hadn't, and said a person that started in to <lb/>
carry a cat home by the tail was gitting knowledge that <lb/>
was always going to be useful to him, and warn't ever <lb/>
going to grow dim or doubtful. But I can tell you, <lb/>
Jim, Uncle Abner was down on them people that's all <lb/>
the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that <lb/>
happens, no matter whether&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But Jim was asleep. Tom looked kind of ashamed, <lb/>
because you know a person always feels bad when he <lb/>
is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other person <lb/>
is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that <lb/>
way. Of course he oughtn't to go to sleep, because <lb/>
it's shabby; but the finer a person talks the certainer <lb/>
it is to make you sleep, and so when you come to look <lb/>
at it it ain't nobody's fault in particular; both of <lb/>
them's to blame.</p>
<p>Jim begun to snore&#x2014;soft and blubbery at first, <lb/>
then a long rasp, then a stronger one, then a half a <lb/>
dozen horrible ones like the last water sucking down <lb/>
the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more <lb/>
power to it, and some big coughs and snorts flung in, <lb/>
the way a cow does that is choking to death; and <lb/>
when the person has got to that point he is at his level <lb/>
best, and can wake up a man that is in the next block <lb/>
with a dipperful of loddanum in him, but can't wake <lb/>
himself up although all that awful noise of his'n ain't <lb/>
but three inches from his own ears. And that is the <lb/>
curiosest thing in the world, seems to me. But you <lb/>
<pb n="98"/>
rake a match to light the candle, and that little bit of a <lb/>
noise will fetch him. I wish I knowed what was the <lb/>
reason of that, but there don't seem to be no way to <lb/>
find out. Now there was Jim alarming the whole <lb/>
Desert, and yanking the animals out, for miles and <lb/>
miles around, to see what in the nation was going on <lb/>
up there; there warn't nobody nor nothing that was as <lb/>
close to the noise as <i>he</i> was, and yet he was the only <lb/>
cretur that wasn't disturbed by it. We yelled at him <lb/>
and whooped at him, it never done no good; but the <lb/>
first time there come a little wee noise that wasn't of a <lb/>
usual kind it woke him up. No, sir, I've thought it <lb/>
all over, and so has Tom, and there ain't no way to <lb/>
find out why a snorer can't hear himself snore.</p>
<p>Jim said he hadn't been asleep; he just shut his eyes <lb/>
so he could listen better.</p>
<p>Tom said nobody warn't accusing him.</p>
<p>That made him look like he wished he hadn't said <lb/>
anything. And he wanted to git away from the sub- <lb/>
ject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the camel- <lb/>
driver, just the way a person does when he has got <lb/>
catched in something and wants to take it out of some- <lb/>
body else. He let into the camel-driver the hardest he <lb/>
knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and he <lb/>
praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had <lb/>
to agree with him there, too. But Tom says:</p>
<p>"I ain't so sure. You call that dervish so dreadful <lb/>
liberal and good and unselfish, but I don't quite see it. <lb/>
He didn't hunt up another poor dervish, did he? No, <lb/>
he didn't. If he was so unselfish, why didn't he go in <lb/>
<pb n="99"/>
there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go <lb/>
along and be satisfied? No, sir, the person he was <lb/>
hunting for was a man with a hundred camels. He <lb/>
wanted to get away with all the treasure he could."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, he was willin' to divide, fair and <lb/>
square; he only struck for fifty camels."</p>
<p>"Because he knowed how he was going to get all of <lb/>
them by and by."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, he <i>tole</i> de man de truck would make <lb/>
him bline."</p>
<p>"Yes, because he knowed the man's character. It <lb/>
was just the kind of a man he was hunting for&#x2014;a <lb/>
man that never believes in anybody's word or any- <lb/>
body's honorableness, because he ain't got none of his <lb/>
own. I reckon there's lots of people like that dervish. <lb/>
They swindle, right and left, but they always make the <lb/>
other person <i>seem</i> to swindle himself. They keep inside <lb/>
of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain't no <lb/>
way to git hold of them. <i>They</i> don't put the salve on <lb/>
&#x2014;oh, no, that would be sin; but they know how to <lb/>
fool <i>you</i> into putting it on, then it's you that blinds <lb/>
yourself. I reckon the dervish and the camel-driver <lb/>
was just a pair&#x2014;a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a <lb/>
dull, coarse, ignorant one, but both of them rascals, <lb/>
just the same."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, does you reckon dey's any o' dat kind <lb/>
o' salve in de worl' now?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Uncle Abner says there is. He says they've <lb/>
got it in New York, and they put it on country people's <lb/>
eyes and show them all the railroads in the world, and <lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
they go in and git them, and then when they rub the <lb/>
salve on the other eye the other man bids them good- <lb/>
bye and goes off with their railroads. Here's the <lb/>
treasure-hill now. Lower away!"</p>
<p>We landed, but it warn't as interesting as I thought <lb/>
it was going to be, because we couldn't find the place <lb/>
where they went in to git the treasure. Still, it was <lb/>
plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere hill <lb/>
itself where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim <lb/>
said he wouldn't 'a' missed it for three dollars, and I <lb/>
felt the same way.</p>
<p>And to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was <lb/>
the way Tom could come into a strange big country <lb/>
like this and go straight and find a little hump like that <lb/>
and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that <lb/>
was almost just like it, and nothing to help him but <lb/>
only his own learning and his own natural smartness. <lb/>
We talked and talked it over together, but couldn't <lb/>
make out how he done it. He had the best head on <lb/>
him I ever see; and all he lacked was age, to make a <lb/>
name for himself equal to Captain Kidd or George <lb/>
Washington. I bet you it would 'a' crowded either of <lb/>
<i>them</i> to find that hill, with all their gifts, but it warn't <lb/>
nothing to Tom Sawyer; he went across Sahara and <lb/>
put his finger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger <lb/>
out of a bunch of angels.</p>
<p>We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped <lb/>
up a raft of salt around the edges, and loaded up the <lb/>
lion's skin and the tiger's so as they would keep till Jim <lb/>
could tan them.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the sand-storm</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then <lb/>
just as the full moon was touching the ground <lb/>
on the other side of the desert, we see a string of little <lb/>
black figgers moving across its big silver face. You <lb/>
could see them as plain as if they was painted on the <lb/>
moon with ink. It was another caravan. We cooled <lb/>
down our speed and tagged along after it, just to have <lb/>
company, though it warn't going our way. It was a <lb/>
rattler, that caravan, and a most bully sight to look at <lb/>
next morning when the sun come a-streaming across <lb/>
the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels <lb/>
on the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long- <lb/>
legses marching in procession. We never went very <lb/>
near it, because we knowed better now than to act like <lb/>
that and scare people's camels and break up their cara- <lb/>
vans. It was the gayest outfit you ever see, for rich <lb/>
clothes and nobby style. Some of the chiefs rode on <lb/>
dromedaries, the first we ever see, and very tall, and <lb/>
they go plunging along like they was on stilts, and <lb/>
they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and <lb/>
churn up his dinner considerable, I bet you, but they <lb/>
<pb n="102"/>
make noble good time, and a camel ain't nowheres with <lb/>
them for speed.</p>
<p>The caravan camped, during the middle part of the <lb/>
day, and then started again about the middle of the <lb/>
afternoon. Before long the sun begun to look very <lb/>
curious. First it kind of turned to brass, and then to <lb/>
copper, and after that it begun to look like a blood- <lb/>
red ball, and the air got hot and close, and pretty soon <lb/>
all the sky in the west darkened up and looked thick <lb/>
and foggy, but fiery and dreadful&#x2014;like it looks <lb/>
through a piece of red glass, you know. We looked <lb/>
down and see a big confusion going on in the caravan, <lb/>
and a rushing every which way like they was scared; <lb/>
and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and <lb/>
laid there perfectly still.</p>
<p>Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up <lb/>
like an amazing wide wall, and reached from the Desert <lb/>
up into the sky and hid the sun, and it was coming <lb/>
like the nation, too. Then a little faint breeze struck <lb/>
us, and then it come harder, and grains of sand begun <lb/>
to sift against our faces and sting like fire, and Tom <lb/>
sung out:</p>
<p>"It's a sand-storm&#x2014;turn your backs to it!"</p>
<p>We done it; and in another minute it was blowing a <lb/>
gale, and the sand beat against us by the shovelful, and <lb/>
the air was so thick with it we couldn't see a thing. In <lb/>
five minutes the boat was level full, and we was setting <lb/>
on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only <lb/>
our heads out and could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>Then the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous <lb/>
<pb n="103"/>
wall go a-sailing off across the desert, awful to look at, <lb/>
I tell you. We dug ourselves out and looked down, <lb/>
and where the caravan was before there wasn't any- <lb/>
thing but just the sand ocean now, and all still and <lb/>
quiet. All them people and camels was smothered and <lb/>
dead and buried&#x2014;buried under ten foot of sand, we <lb/>
reckoned, and Tom allowed it might be years before <lb/>
the wind uncovered them, and all that time their friends <lb/>
wouldn't ever know what become of that caravan. <lb/>
Tom said:</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i> we know what it was that happened to the <lb/>
people we got the swords and pistols from."</p>
<p>Yes, sir, that was just it. It was as plain as day <lb/>
now. They got buried in a sand-storm, and the wild <lb/>
animals couldn't get at them, and the wind never un- <lb/>
covered them again until they was dried to leather and <lb/>
warn't fit to eat. It seemed to me we had felt as sorry <lb/>
for them poor people as a person could for anybody, <lb/>
and as mournful, too, but we was mistaken; this last <lb/>
caravan's death went harder with us, a good deal <lb/>
harder. You see, the others was total strangers, and <lb/>
we never got to feeling acquainted with them at all, <lb/>
except, maybe, a little with the man that was watching <lb/>
the girl, but it was different with this last caravan. We <lb/>
was huvvering around them a whole night and 'most a <lb/>
whole day, and had got to feeling real friendly with <lb/>
them, and acquainted. I have found out that there <lb/>
ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people <lb/>
or hate them than to travel with them: Just so with <lb/>
these. We kind of liked them from the start, and <lb/>
<pb n="104"/>
traveling with them put on the finisher. The longer <lb/>
we traveled with them, and the more we got used to <lb/>
their ways, the better and better we liked them, and <lb/>
the gladder and gladder we was that we run across <lb/>
them. We had come to know some of them so well <lb/>
that we called them by name when we was talking <lb/>
about them, and soon got so familiar and sociable that <lb/>
we even dropped the Miss and Mister and just used <lb/>
their plain names without any handle, and it did not <lb/>
seem unpolite, but just the right thing. Of course, it <lb/>
wasn't their own names, but names we give them. <lb/>
There was Mr. Elexander Robinson and Miss Adaline <lb/>
Robinson, and Colonel Jacob McDougal and Miss <lb/>
Harryet McDougal, and Judge Jeremiah Butler and <lb/>
young Bushrod Butler, and these was big chiefs mostly <lb/>
that wore splendid great turbans and simmeters, and <lb/>
dressed like the Grand Mogul, and their families. But <lb/>
as soon as we come to know them good, and like them <lb/>
very much, it warn't Mister, nor Judge, nor nothing, <lb/>
any more, but only Elleck, and Addy, and Jake, and <lb/>
Hattie, and Jerry, and Buck, and so on.</p>
<p>And you know the more you join in with people in <lb/>
their joys and their sorrows, the more nearer and <lb/>
dearer they come to be to you. Now we warn't cold <lb/>
and indifferent, the way most travelers is, we was right <lb/>
down friendly and sociable, and took a chance in every- <lb/>
thing that was going, and the caravan could depend on <lb/>
us to be on hand every time, it didn't make no differ- <lb/>
ence what it was.</p>
<p>When they camped, we camped right over them, ten <lb/>
<pb n="105"/>
or twelve hundred feet up in the air. When they et a <lb/>
meal, we et ourn, and it made it ever so much home- <lb/>
liker to have their company. When they had a wed- <lb/>
ding that night, and Buck and Addy got married, we <lb/>
got ourselves up in the very starchiest of the professor's <lb/>
duds for the blow-out, and when they danced we jined <lb/>
in and shook a foot up there.</p>
<p>But it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the <lb/>
nearest, and it was a funeral that done it with us. It <lb/>
was next morning, just in the still dawn. We didn't <lb/>
know the diseased, and he warn't in our set, but that <lb/>
never made no difference; he belonged to the caravan, <lb/>
and that was enough, and there warn't no more sincerer <lb/>
tears shed over him than the ones we dripped on him <lb/>
from up there eleven hundred foot on high.</p>
<p>Yes, parting with this caravan was much more <lb/>
bitterer than it was to part with them others, which was <lb/>
comparative strangers, and been dead so long, anyway. <lb/>
We had knowed these in their lives, and was fond of <lb/>
them, too, and now to have death snatch them from <lb/>
right before our faces while we was looking, and leave <lb/>
us so lonesome and friendless in the middle of that big <lb/>
desert, it did hurt so, and we wished we mightn't ever <lb/>
make any more friends on that voyage if we was <lb/>
going to lose them again like that.</p>
<p>We couldn't keep from talking about them, and <lb/>
they was all the time coming up in our memory, and <lb/>
looking just the way they looked when we was all alive <lb/>
and happy together. We could see the line marching, <lb/>
and the shiny spearheads a-winking in the sun; we <lb/>
<pb n="106"/>
could see the dromedaries lumbering along; we could <lb/>
see the wedding and the funeral; and more oftener <lb/>
than anything else we could see them praying, because <lb/>
they don't allow nothing to prevent that; whenever <lb/>
the call come, several times a day, they would stop <lb/>
right there, and stand up and face to the east, and lift <lb/>
back their heads, and spread out their arms and begin, <lb/>
and four or five times they would go down on their <lb/>
knees, and then fall forward and touch their forehead <lb/>
to the ground.</p>
<p>Well, it warn't good to go on talking about them, <lb/>
lovely as they was in their life, and dear to us in their <lb/>
life and death both, because it didn't do no good, and <lb/>
made us too down-hearted. Jim allowed he was going <lb/>
to live as good a life as he could, so he could see them <lb/>
again in a better world; and Tom kept still and didn't <lb/>
tell him they was only Mohammedans; it warn't no <lb/>
use to disappoint him, he was feeling bad enough just <lb/>
as it was.</p>
<p>When we woke up next morning we was feeling a <lb/>
little cheerfuller, and had had a most powerful good <lb/>
sleep, because sand is the comfortablest bed there is, <lb/>
and I don't see why people that can afford it don't <lb/>
have it more. And it's terrible good ballast, too; I <lb/>
never see the balloon so steady before.</p>
<p>Tom allowed we had twenty tons of it, and wondered <lb/>
what we better do with it; it was good sand, and it <lb/>
didn't seem good sense to throw it away. Jim says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, can't we tote it back home en sell it? <lb/>
How long'll it take?"</p>
<pb n="107"/>
<p>"Depends on the way we go."</p>
<p>"Well, sah, she's wuth a quarter of a dollar a load <lb/>
at home, en I reckon we's got as much as twenty <lb/>
loads, hain't we? How much would dat be?"</p>
<p>"Five dollars."</p>
<p>"By jings, Mars Tom, le's shove for home right on <lb/>
de spot! Hit's more'n a dollar en a half apiece, hain't <lb/>
it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, ef dat ain't makin' money de easiest ever <i>I</i> <lb/>
struck! She jes' rained in&#x2014;never cos' us a lick o' <lb/>
work. Le's mosey right along, Mars Tom."</p>
<p>But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy <lb/>
and excited he never heard him. Pretty soon he says:</p>
<p>"Five dollars&#x2014;sho! Look here, this sand's worth <lb/>
&#x2014;worth&#x2014;why, it's worth no end of money."</p>
<p>"How is dat, Mars Tom? Go on, honey, go on!"</p>
<p>"Well, the minute people knows it's genuwyne sand <lb/>
from the genuwyne Desert of Sahara, they'll just be in <lb/>
a perfect state of mind to git hold of some of it to <lb/>
keep on the what-not in a vial with a label on it for a <lb/>
curiosity. All we got to do is to put it up in vials and <lb/>
float around all over the United States and peddle them <lb/>
out at ten cents apiece. We've got all of ten thousand <lb/>
dollars' worth of sand in this boat."</p>
<p>Me and Jim went all to pieces with joy, and begun <lb/>
to shout whoopjamboreehoo, and Tom says:</p>
<p>"And we can keep on coming back and fetching <lb/>
sand, and coming back and fetching more sand, and <lb/>
just keep it a-going till we've carted this whole Desert <lb/>
<pb n="108"/>
over there and sold it out; and there ain't ever going <lb/>
to be any opposition, either, because we'll take out a <lb/>
patent."</p>
<p>"My goodness," I says, "we'll be as rich as Creo- <lb/>
sote, won't we, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;Creesus, you mean. Why, that dervish was <lb/>
hunting in that little hill for the treasures of the earth, <lb/>
and didn't know he was walking over the real ones for <lb/>
a thousand miles. He was blinder than he made the <lb/>
driver."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, how much is we gwyne to be worth?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know yet. It's got to be ciphered, <lb/>
and it ain't the easiest job to do, either, because it's <lb/>
over four million square miles of sand at ten cents a <lb/>
vial."</p>
<p>Jim was awful excited, but this faded it out consider- <lb/>
able, and he shook his head and says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, we can't 'ford all dem vials&#x2014;a king <lb/>
couldn't. We better not try to take de whole Desert, <lb/>
Mars Tom, de vials gwyne to bust us, sho'."</p>
<p>Tom's excitement died out, too, now, and I reck- <lb/>
oned it was on account of the vials, but it wasn't. He <lb/>
set there thinking, and got bluer and bluer, and at last <lb/>
he says:</p>
<p>"Boys, it won't work; we got to give it up."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom?"</p>
<p>"On account of the duties."</p>
<p>I couldn't make nothing out of that, neither could <lb/>
Jim. I says:</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> our duty, Tom? Because if we can't git <lb/>
<pb n="109"/>
around it, why can't we just <i>do</i> it? People often has <lb/>
to."</p>
<p>But he says:</p>
<p>"Oh, it ain't that kind of duty. The kind I mean <lb/>
is a tax. Whenever you strike a frontier&#x2014;that's the <lb/>
border of a country, you know&#x2014;you find a custom- <lb/>
house there, and the gov'ment officers comes and rum- <lb/>
mages among your things and charges a big tax, which <lb/>
they call a duty because it's their duty to bust you if <lb/>
they can, and if you don't pay the duty they'll hog <lb/>
your sand. They call it confiscating, but that don't <lb/>
deceive nobody, it's just hogging, and that's all it is. <lb/>
Now if we try to carry this sand home the way we're <lb/>
pointed now, we got to climb fences till we git tired&#x2014; <lb/>
just frontier after frontier&#x2014;Egypt, Arabia, Hindostan, <lb/>
and so on, and they'll all whack on a duty, and so you <lb/>
see, easy enough, we <i>can't</i> go <i>that</i> road."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom," I says, "we can sail right over their <lb/>
old frontiers; how are <i>they</i> going to stop us?"</p>
<p>He looked sorrowful at me, and says, very grave:</p>
<p>"Huck Finn, do you think that would be honest?"</p>
<p>I hate them kind of interruptions. I never said <lb/>
nothing, and he went on:</p>
<p>"Well, we're shut off the other way, too. If we go <lb/>
back the way we've come, there's the New York <lb/>
custom-house, and that is worse than all of them others <lb/>
put together, on account of the kind of cargo we've <lb/>
got."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, they can't raise Sahara sand in America, of <lb/>
<pb n="110"/>
course, and when they can't raise a thing there, the <lb/>
duty is fourteen hundred thousand per cent. on it if <lb/>
you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it."</p>
<p>"There ain't no sense in that, Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>"Who said there <i>was?</i> What do you talk to me <lb/>
like that for, Huck Finn? You wait till I say a thing's <lb/>
got sense in it before you go to accusing me of say- <lb/>
ing it."</p>
<p>"All right, consider me crying about it, and sorry. <lb/>
Go on."</p>
<p>Jim says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, do dey jam dat duty onto everything <lb/>
we can't raise in America, en don't make no 'stinction <lb/>
'twix' anything?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what they do."</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, ain't de blessin' o' de Lord de mos' <lb/>
valuable thing dey is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is."</p>
<p>"Don't de preacher stan' up in de pulpit en call it <lb/>
down on de people?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Whah do it come from?"</p>
<p>"From heaven."</p>
<p>"Yassir! you's jes' right, 'deed you is, honey&#x2014;it <lb/>
come from heaven, en dat's a foreign country. <i>Now</i>, <lb/>
den! do dey put a tax on dat blessin'?"</p>
<p>"No, they don't."</p>
<p>"Course dey don't; en so it stan' to reason dat <lb/>
you's mistaken, Mars Tom. Dey wouldn't put de tax <lb/>
on po' truck like san', dat everybody ain't 'bleeged to <lb/>
<pb n="111"/>
have, en leave it off'n de bes' thing dey is, which <lb/>
nobody can't git along widout."</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer was stumped; he see Jim had got him <lb/>
where he couldn't budge. He tried to wiggle out by <lb/>
saying they had <i>forgot</i> to put on that tax, but they'd <lb/>
be sure to remember about it, next session of Con- <lb/>
gress, and then they'd put it on, but that was a poor <lb/>
lame come-off, and he knowed it. He said there <lb/>
warn't nothing foreign that warn't taxed but just that <lb/>
one, and so they couldn't be consistent without taxing <lb/>
it, and to be consistent was the first law of politics. <lb/>
So he stuck to it that they'd left it out unintentional <lb/>
and would be certain to do their best to fix it before <lb/>
they got caught and laughed at.</p>
<p>But I didn't feel no more interest in such things, as <lb/>
long as we couldn't git our sand through, and it made <lb/>
me low-spirited, and Jim the same. Tom he tried to <lb/>
cheer us up by saying he would think up another <lb/>
speculation for us that would be just as good as this <lb/>
one and better, but it didn't do no good, we didn't <lb/>
believe there was any as big as this. It was mighty <lb/>
hard; such a little while ago we was so rich, and could <lb/>
'a' bought a country and started a kingdom and been <lb/>
celebrated and happy, and now we was so poor and <lb/>
ornery again, and had our sand left on our hands. <lb/>
The sand was looking so lovely before, just like gold <lb/>
and di'monds, and the feel of it was so soft and so <lb/>
silky and nice, but now I couldn't bear the sight of it, <lb/>
it made me sick to look at it, and I knowed I wouldn't <lb/>
ever feel comfortable again till we got shut of it, and I <lb/>
<pb n="112"/>
didn't have it there no more to remind us of what we <lb/>
had been and what we had got degraded down to. <lb/>
The others was feeling the same way about it that I <lb/>
was. I knowed it, because they cheered up so, the <lb/>
minute I says le's throw this truck overboard.</p>
<p>Well, it was going to be work, you know, and pretty <lb/>
solid work, too; so Tom he divided it up according to <lb/>
fairness and strength. He said me and him would <lb/>
clear out a fifth apiece of the sand, and Jim three- <lb/>
fifths. Jim he didn't quite like that arrangement. He <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"Course I's de stronges', en I's willin' to do a share <lb/>
accordin', but by jings you's kinder pilin' it onto ole <lb/>
Jim, Mars Tom, hain't you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't think so, Jim, but you try your hand <lb/>
at fixing it, and let's see."</p>
<p>So Jim reckoned it wouldn't be no more than fair if <lb/>
me and Tom done a <i>tenth</i> apiece. Tom he turned his <lb/>
back to git room and be private, and then he smole a <lb/>
smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara <lb/>
to the westward, back to the Atlantic edge of it where <lb/>
we come from. Then he turned around again and <lb/>
said it was a good enough arrangement, and we was <lb/>
satisfied if Jim was. Jim said he was.</p>
<p>So then Tom measured off our two-tenths in the <lb/>
bow and left the rest for Jim, and it surprised Jim a <lb/>
good deal to see how much difference there was and <lb/>
what a raging lot of sand his share come to, and said <lb/>
he was powerful glad now that he had spoke up in time <lb/>
and got the first arrangement altered, for he said that <lb/>
<pb n="113"/>
even the way it was now, there was more sand than <lb/>
enjoyment in his end of the contract, he believed.</p>
<p>Then we laid into it. It was mighty hot work, and <lb/>
tough; so hot we had to move up into cooler weather <lb/>
or we couldn't 'a' stood it. Me and Tom took turn <lb/>
about, and one worked while t'other rested, but there <lb/>
warn't nobody to spell poor old Jim, and he made all <lb/>
that part of Africa damp, he sweated so. We couldn't <lb/>
work good, we was so full of laugh, and Jim he kept <lb/>
fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so, and <lb/>
we had to keep making up things to account for it, and <lb/>
they was pretty poor inventions, but they done well <lb/>
enough, Jim didn't see through them. At last when <lb/>
we got done we was 'most dead, but not with work <lb/>
but with laughing. By and by Jim was 'most dead, <lb/>
too, but it was with work; then we took turns and <lb/>
spelled him, and he was as thankful as he could be, <lb/>
and would set on the gunnel and swab the sweat, and <lb/>
heave and pant, and say how good we was to a poor <lb/>
old nigger, and he wouldn't ever forgit us. He was <lb/>
always the gratefulest nigger I ever see, for any little <lb/>
thing you done for him. He was only nigger outside; <lb/>
inside he was as white as you be.</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> next few meals was pretty sandy, but that <lb/>
don't make no difference when you are hungry; <lb/>
and when you ain't it ain't no satisfaction to eat, any- <lb/>
way, and so a little grit in the meat ain't no particular <lb/>
drawback, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Then we struck the east end of the Desert at last, <lb/>
sailing on a northeast course. Away off on the edge <lb/>
of the sand, in a soft pinky light, we see three little <lb/>
sharp roofs like tents, and Tom says:</p>
<p>"It's the pyramids of Egypt."</p>
<p>It made my heart fairly jump. You see, I had seen <lb/>
a many and a many a picture of them, and heard tell <lb/>
about them a hundred times, and yet to come on them <lb/>
all of a sudden, that way, and find they was <i>real</i>, 'stead <lb/>
of imaginations, 'most knocked the breath out of me <lb/>
with surprise. It's a curious thing, that the more you <lb/>
hear about a grand and big and bully thing or person, <lb/>
the more it kind of dreamies out, as you may say, and <lb/>
gets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moon- <lb/>
shine and nothing solid to it. It's just so with George <lb/>
Washington, and the same with them pyramids.</p>
<pb n="115"/>
<p>And moreover, besides, the thing they always said <lb/>
about them seemed to me to be stretchers. There was <lb/>
a feller come to the Sunday-school once, and had a <lb/>
picture of them, and made a speech, and said the big- <lb/>
gest pyramid covered thirteen acres, and was most five <lb/>
hundred foot high, just a steep mountain, all built out <lb/>
of hunks of stone as big as a bureau, and laid up <lb/>
in perfectly regular layers, like stair-steps. Thirteen <lb/>
acres, you see, for just one building; it's a farm. If <lb/>
it hadn't been in Sunday-school, I would 'a' judged it <lb/>
was a lie; and outside I was certain of it. And he <lb/>
said there was a hole in the pyramid, and you could go <lb/>
in there with candles, and go ever so far up a long <lb/>
slanting tunnel, and come to a large room in the <lb/>
stomach of that stone mountain, and there you would <lb/>
find a big stone chest with a king in it, four thousand <lb/>
years old. I said to myself, then, if that ain't a lie I <lb/>
will eat that king if they will fetch him, for even <lb/>
Methusalem warn't that old, and nobody claims it.</p>
<p>As we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand <lb/>
come to an end in a long straight edge like a blanket, <lb/>
and on to it was joined, edge to edge, a wide country <lb/>
of bright green, with a snaky stripe crooking through <lb/>
it, and Tom said it was the Nile. It made my heart <lb/>
jump again, for the Nile was another thing that wasn't <lb/>
real to me. Now I can tell you one thing which is <lb/>
dead certain: if you will fool along over three thou- <lb/>
sand miles of yaller sand, all glimmering with heat so <lb/>
that it makes your eyes water to look at it, and you've <lb/>
been a considerable part of a week doing it, the green <lb/>
<pb n="116"/>
country will look so like home and heaven to you that <lb/>
it will make your eyes water <i>again</i>.</p>
<p>It was just so with me, and the same with Jim.</p>
<p>And when Jim got so he could believe it <i>was</i> the <lb/>
land of Egypt he was looking at, he wouldn't enter it <lb/>
standing up, but got down on his knees and took off <lb/>
his hat, because he said it wasn't fitten' for a humble <lb/>
poor nigger to come any other way where such men <lb/>
had been as Moses and Joseph and Pharaoh and the <lb/>
other prophets. He was a Presbyterian, and had a <lb/>
most deep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian, <lb/>
too, he said. He was all stirred up, and says:</p>
<p>"Hit's de lan' of Egypt, de lan' of Egypt, en I's <lb/>
'lowed to look at it wid my own eyes! En dah's de <lb/>
river dat was turn' to blood, en I's looking at de very <lb/>
same groun' whah de plagues was, en de lice, en de <lb/>
frogs, en de locus', en de hail, en whah dey marked <lb/>
de door-pos', en de angel o' de Lord come by in de <lb/>
darkness o' de night en slew de fust-born in all de lan' <lb/>
o' Egypt. Ole Jim ain't worthy to see dis day!"</p>
<p>And then he just broke down and cried, he was so <lb/>
thankful. So between him and Tom there was talk <lb/>
enough, Jim being excited because the land was so full <lb/>
of history&#x2014;Joseph and his brethren, Moses in the <lb/>
bulrushers, Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy <lb/>
corn, the silver cup in the sack, and all them interesting <lb/>
things; and Tom just as excited too, because the land <lb/>
was so full of history that was in <i>his</i> line, about <lb/>
Noureddin, and Bedreddin, and such like monstrous <lb/>
giants, that made Jim's wool rise, and a raft of other <lb/>
<pb n="117"/>
Arabian Nights folks, which the half of them never <lb/>
done the things they let on they done, I don't believe.</p>
<p>Then we struck a disappointment, for one of them <lb/>
early morning fogs started up, and it warn't no use to <lb/>
sail over the top of it, because we would go by Egypt, <lb/>
sure, so we judged it was best to set her by compass <lb/>
straight for the place where the pyramids was gitting <lb/>
blurred and blotted out, and then drop low and skin <lb/>
along pretty close to the ground and keep a sharp <lb/>
lookout. Tom took the hellum, I stood by to let go <lb/>
the anchor, and Jim he straddled the bow to dig <lb/>
through the fog with his eyes and watch out for danger <lb/>
ahead. We went along a steady gait, but not very <lb/>
fast, and the fog got solider and solider, so solid that <lb/>
Jim looked dim and ragged and smoky through it. It <lb/>
was awful still, and we talked low and was anxious. <lb/>
Now and then Jim would say:</p>
<p>"Highst her a p'int, Mars Tom, highst her!" and <lb/>
up she would skip, a foot or two, and we would slide <lb/>
right over a flat-roofed mud cabin, with people that <lb/>
had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and <lb/>
gap and stretch; and once when a feller was clear up <lb/>
on his hind legs so he could gap and stretch better, we <lb/>
took him a blip in the back and knocked him off. By <lb/>
and by, after about an hour, and everything dead still <lb/>
and we a-straining our ears for sounds and holding our <lb/>
breath, the fog thinned a little, very sudden, and Jim <lb/>
sung out in an awful scare:</p>
<p>"Oh, for de lan's sake, set her back, Mars Tom, <lb/>
here's de biggest giant outen de 'Rabian Nights a- <lb/>
<pb n="118"/>
comin' for us!" and he went over backwards in the <lb/>
boat.</p>
<p>Tom slammed on the back-action, and as we slowed <lb/>
to a standstill a man's face as big as our house at home <lb/>
looked in over the gunnel, same as a house looks out <lb/>
of its windows, and I laid down and died. I must 'a' <lb/>
been clear dead and gone for as much as a minute or <lb/>
more; then I come to, and Tom had hitched a boat- <lb/>
hook on to the lower lip of the giant and was holding <lb/>
the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head <lb/>
back and got a good long look up at that awful face.</p>
<p>Jim was on his knees with his hands clasped, gazing <lb/>
up at the thing in a begging way, and working his lips, <lb/>
but not getting anything out. I took only just a <lb/>
glimpse, and was fading out again, but Tom says:</p>
<p>"He ain't alive, you fools; it's the Sphinx!"</p>
<p>I never see Tom look so little and like a fly; <lb/>
but that was because the giant's head was so big and <lb/>
awful. Awful, yes, so it was, but not dreadful any <lb/>
more, because you could see it was a noble face, <lb/>
and kind of sad, and not thinking about you, but about <lb/>
other things and larger. It was stone, reddish stone, <lb/>
and its nose and ears battered, and that give it an <lb/>
abused look, and you felt sorrier for it for that.</p>
<p>We stood off a piece, and sailed around it and over <lb/>
it, and it was just grand. It was a man's head, or <lb/>
maybe a woman's, on a tiger's body a hundred and <lb/>
twenty-five foot long, and there was a dear little temple <lb/>
between its front paws. All but the head used to be <lb/>
under the sand, for hundreds of years, maybe thou- <lb/>
<pb n="119"/>
sands, but they had just lately dug the sand away and <lb/>
found that little temple. It took a power of sand to <lb/>
bury that cretur; most as much as it would to bury a <lb/>
steamboat, I reckon.</p>
<p>We landed Jim on top of the head, with an American <lb/>
flag to protect him, it being a foreign land; then we <lb/>
sailed off to this and that and t'other distance, to git <lb/>
what Tom called effects and perspectives and propor- <lb/>
tions, and Jim he done the best he could, striking all <lb/>
the different kinds of attitudes and positions he could <lb/>
study up, but standing on his head and working his <lb/>
legs the way a frog does was the best. The further we <lb/>
got away, the littler Jim got, and the grander the <lb/>
Sphinx got, till at last it was only a clothespin on a <lb/>
dome, as you might say. That's the way perspective <lb/>
brings out the correct proportions, Tom said; he said <lb/>
Julus Cesar's niggers didn't know how big he was, <lb/>
they was too close to him.</p>
<p>Then we sailed off further and further, till we <lb/>
couldn't see Jim at all any more, and then that great <lb/>
figger was at its noblest, a-gazing out over the Nile <lb/>
Valley so still and solemn and lonesome, and all the <lb/>
little shabby huts and things that was scattered about it <lb/>
clean disappeared and gone, and nothing around it now <lb/>
but a soft wide spread of yaller velvet, which was the <lb/>
sand.</p>
<p>That was the right place to stop, and we done it. <lb/>
We set there a-looking and a-thinking for a half an <lb/>
hour, nobody a-saying anything, for it made us feel <lb/>
quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been <lb/>
<pb n="120"/>
looking over that valley just that same way, and think- <lb/>
ing its awful thoughts all to itself for thousands of <lb/>
years, and nobody can't find out what they are to this <lb/>
day.</p>
<p>At last I took up the glass and see some little black <lb/>
things a-capering around on that velvet carpet, and <lb/>
some more a-climbing up the cretur's back, and then I <lb/>
see two or three wee puffs of white smoke, and told <lb/>
Tom to look. He done it, and says:</p>
<p>"They're bugs. No&#x2014;hold on; they&#x2014;why, I be- <lb/>
lieve they're men. Yes, it's men&#x2014;men and horses <lb/>
both. They're hauling a long ladder up onto the <lb/>
Sphinx's back&#x2014;now ain't that odd? And now they're <lb/>
trying to lean it up a&#x2014;there's some more puffs of <lb/>
smoke&#x2014;it's guns! Huck, they're after Jim."</p>
<p>We clapped on the power, and went for them a- <lb/>
biling. We was there in no time, and come a-whizzing <lb/>
down amongst them, and they broke and scattered every <lb/>
which way, and some that was climbing the ladder after <lb/>
Jim let go all holts and fell. We soared up and found <lb/>
him laying on top of the head panting and most <lb/>
tuckered out, partly from howling for help and partly <lb/>
from scare. He had been standing a siege a long time <lb/>
&#x2014;a week, <i>he</i> said, but it warn't so, it only just seemed <lb/>
so to him because they was crowding him so. They <lb/>
had shot at him, and rained the bullets all around him, <lb/>
but he warn't hit, and when they found he wouldn't <lb/>
stand up and the bullets couldn't git at him when he <lb/>
was laying down, they went for the ladder, and then <lb/>
he knowed it was all up with him if we didn't come <lb/>
<pb n="121"/>
pretty quick. Tom was very indignant, and asked him <lb/>
why he didn't show the flag and command them to <i>git</i>, <lb/>
in the name of the United States. Jim said he done <lb/>
it, but they never paid no attention. Tom said he <lb/>
would have this thing looked into at Washington, and <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"You'll see that they'll have to apologize for insult- <lb/>
ing the flag, and pay an indemnity, too, on top of it, <lb/>
even if they git off <i>that</i> easy."</p>
<p>Jim says:</p>
<p>"What's an indemnity, Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"It's cash, that's what it is."</p>
<p>"Who gits it, Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"Why, <i>we</i> do."</p>
<p>"En who gits de apology?"</p>
<p>"The United States. Or, we can take whichever <lb/>
we please. We can take the apology, if we want to, <lb/>
and let the gov'ment take the money."</p>
<p>"How much money will it be, Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"Well, in an aggravated case like this one, it will <lb/>
be at least three dollars apiece, and I don't know but <lb/>
more."</p>
<p>"Well, den, we'll take de money, Mars Tom, blame <lb/>
de 'pology. Hain't dat yo' notion, too? En hain't it <lb/>
yourn, Huck?"</p>
<p>We talked it over a little and allowed that that was as <lb/>
good a way as any, so we agreed to take the money. <lb/>
It was a new business to me, and I asked Tom if <lb/>
countries always apologized when they had done wrong, <lb/>
and he says:</p>
<pb n="122"/>
<p>"Yes; the little ones does."</p>
<p>We was sailing around examining the pyramids, you <lb/>
know, and now we soared up and roosted on the flat top <lb/>
of the biggest one, and found it was just like what the <lb/>
man said in the Sunday-school. It was like four pairs <lb/>
of stairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up <lb/>
and comes together in a point at the top, only these <lb/>
stair-steps couldn't be clumb the way you climb other <lb/>
stairs; no, for each step was as high as your chin, and <lb/>
you have to be boosted up from behind. The two <lb/>
other pyramids warn't far away, and the people moving <lb/>
about on the sand between looked like bugs crawling, <lb/>
we was so high above them.</p>
<p>Tom he couldn't hold himself he was so worked up <lb/>
with gladness and astonishment to be in such a cele- <lb/>
brated place, and he just dripped history from every <lb/>
pore, seemed to me. He said he couldn't scarcely <lb/>
believe he was standing on the very identical spot the <lb/>
prince flew from on the Bronze Horse. It was in the <lb/>
Arabian Night times, he said. Somebody give the <lb/>
prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder, and <lb/>
he could git on him and fly through the air like a bird, <lb/>
and go all over the world, and steer it by turning the <lb/>
peg, and fly high or low and land wherever he wanted <lb/>
to.</p>
<p>When he got done telling it there was one of them <lb/>
uncomfortable silences that comes, you know, when a <lb/>
person has been telling a whopper and you feel sorry <lb/>
for him and wish you could think of some way to <lb/>
change the subject and let him down easy, but git stuck <lb/>
<pb n="123"/>
and don't see no way, and before you can pull your <lb/>
mind together and <i>do</i> something, that silence has got in <lb/>
and spread itself and done the business. I was embar- <lb/>
rassed, Jim he was embarrassed, and neither of us <lb/>
couldn't say a word. Well, Tom he glowered at me a <lb/>
minute, and says:</p>
<p>"Come, out with it. What do you think?"</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, <i>you</i> don't believe that, yourself."</p>
<p>"What's the reason I don't? What's to hender <lb/>
me?"</p>
<p>"There's one thing to hender you: it couldn't <lb/>
happen, that's all."</p>
<p>"What's the reason it couldn't happen?"</p>
<p>"You tell me the reason it <i>could</i> happen."</p>
<p>"This balloon is a good enough reason it could <lb/>
happen, I should reckon."</p>
<p>"<i>Why</i> is it?"</p>
<p>"<i>Why</i> is it? I never saw such an idiot. Ain't this <lb/>
balloon and the bronze horse the same thing under <lb/>
different names?"</p>
<p>"No, they're not. One is a balloon and the other's <lb/>
a horse. It's very different. Next you'll be saying a <lb/>
house and a cow is the same thing."</p>
<p>"By Jackson, Huck's got him ag'in! Dey ain't no <lb/>
wigglin' outer dat!"</p>
<p>"Shut your head, Jim; you don't know what you're <lb/>
talking about. And Huck don't. Look here, Huck, <lb/>
I'll make it plain to you, so you can understand. You <lb/>
see, it ain't the mere <i>form</i> that's got anything to do <lb/>
<pb n="124"/>
with their being similar or unsimilar, it's the <i>princi- <lb/>
ple</i> involved; and the principle is the same in both. <lb/>
Don't you see, now?"</p>
<p>I turned it over in my mind, and says:</p>
<p>"Tom, it ain't no use. Principles is all very well, <lb/>
but they don't git around that one big fact, that the <lb/>
thing that a balloon can do ain't no sort of proof of <lb/>
what a horse can do."</p>
<p>"Shucks, Huck, you don't get the idea at all. Now <lb/>
look here a minute&#x2014;it's perfectly plain. Don't we <lb/>
fly through the air?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Very well. Don't we fly high or fly low, just as <lb/>
we please?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Don't we steer whichever way we want to?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And don't we land when and where we please?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How do we move the balloon and steer it?"</p>
<p>"By touching the buttons."</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i> I reckon the thing is clear to you at last. In <lb/>
the other case the moving and steering was done by <lb/>
turning a peg. We touch a button, the prince turned <lb/>
a peg. There ain't an atom of difference, you see. I <lb/>
knowed I could git it through your head if I stuck to it <lb/>
long enough."</p>
<p>He felt so happy he begun to whistle. But me and <lb/>
Jim was silent, so he broke off surprised, and says:</p>
<p>"Looky here, Huck Finn, don't you see it <i>yet?</i>"</p>
<pb n="125"/>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, I want to ask you some questions."</p>
<p>"Go ahead," he says, and I see Jim chirk up to <lb/>
listen.</p>
<p>"As I understand it, the whole thing is in the buttons <lb/>
and the peg&#x2014;the rest ain't of no consequence. A <lb/>
button is one shape, a peg is another shape, but that <lb/>
ain't any matter?"</p>
<p>"No, that ain't any matter, as long as they've both <lb/>
got the same power."</p>
<p>"All right, then. What is the power that's in a <lb/>
candle and in a match?"</p>
<p>"It's the fire."</p>
<p>"It's the same in both, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, just the same in both."</p>
<p>"All right. Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop <lb/>
with a match, what will happen to that carpenter <lb/>
shop?"</p>
<p>"She'll burn up."</p>
<p>"And suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a <lb/>
candle&#x2014;will she burn up?"</p>
<p>"Of course she won't."</p>
<p>"All right. Now the fire's the same, both times. <lb/>
<i>Why</i> does the shop burn, and the pyramid don't?"</p>
<p>"Because the pyramid <i>can't</i> burn."</p>
<p>"Aha! and <i>a horse can't fly!</i>"</p>
<p>"My lan', ef Huck ain't got him ag'in! Huck's <lb/>
landed him high en dry dis time, <i>I</i> tell you! Hit's <lb/>
de smartes' trap I ever see a body walk inter&#x2014;en <lb/>
ef I&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p>But Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and <lb/>
couldn't go on, and Tom was that mad to see how neat <lb/>
I had floored him, and turned his own argument ag'in <lb/>
him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it, <lb/>
that all he could manage to say was that whenever he <lb/>
heard me and Jim try to argue it made him ashamed <lb/>
of the human race. I never said nothing; I was feel- <lb/>
ing pretty well satisfied. When I have got the best of <lb/>
a person that way, it ain't my way to go around crow- <lb/>
ing about it the way some people does, for I consider <lb/>
that if I was in his place I wouldn't wish him to crow <lb/>
over me. It's better to be generous, that's what I <lb/>
think.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>going for tom's pipe</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>By and by</smcap> we left Jim to float around up there in <lb/>
the neighborhood of the pyramids, and we clumb <lb/>
down to the hole where you go into the tunnel, and <lb/>
went in with some Arabs and candles, and away in <lb/>
there in the middle of the pyramid we found a room and <lb/>
a big stone box in it where they used to keep that king, <lb/>
just as the man in the Sunday-school said; but he was <lb/>
gone, now; somebody had got him. But I didn't take <lb/>
no interest in the place, because there could be ghosts <lb/>
there, of course; not fresh ones, but I don't like no <lb/>
kind.</p>
<p>So then we come out and got some little donkeys and <lb/>
rode a piece, and then went in a boat another piece, <lb/>
and then more donkeys, and got to Cairo; and all the way <lb/>
the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as ever I <lb/>
see, and had tall date-pa'ms on both sides, and naked <lb/>
children everywhere, and the men was as red as copper, <lb/>
and fine and strong and handsome. And the city was <lb/>
a curiosity. Such narrow streets&#x2014;why, they were <lb/>
just lanes, and crowded with people with turbans, and <lb/>
women with veils, and everybody rigged out in blazing <lb/>
<pb n="128"/>
bright clothes and all sorts of colors, and you wondered <lb/>
how the camels and the people got by each other in <lb/>
such narrow little cracks, but they done it&#x2014;a perfect <lb/>
jam, you see, and everybody noisy. The stores warn't <lb/>
big enough to turn around in, but you didn't have to <lb/>
go in; the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on his counter, <lb/>
smoking his snaky long pipe, and had his things where <lb/>
he could reach them to sell, and he was just as good as <lb/>
in the street, for the camel-loads brushed him as they <lb/>
went by.</p>
<p>Now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage <lb/>
with fancy dressed men running and yelling in front of <lb/>
it and whacking anybody with a long rod that didn't <lb/>
get out of the way. And by and by along comes the <lb/>
Sultan riding horseback at the head of a procession, <lb/>
and fairly took your breath away his clothes was so <lb/>
splendid; and everybody fell flat and laid on his <lb/>
stomach while he went by. I forgot, but a feller <lb/>
helped me to remember. He was one that had a rod <lb/>
and run in front.</p>
<p>There was churches, but they don't know enough to <lb/>
keep Sunday; they keep Friday and break the Sab- <lb/>
bath. You have to take off your shoes when you go <lb/>
in. There was crowds of men and boys in the church, <lb/>
setting in groups on the stone floor and making no end <lb/>
of noise&#x2014;getting their lessons by heart, Tom said, out <lb/>
of the Koran, which they think is a Bible, and people <lb/>
that knows better knows enough to not let on. I never <lb/>
see such a big church in my life before, and most awful <lb/>
high, it was; it made you dizzy to look up; our <lb/>
<pb n="129"/>
village church at home ain't a circumstance to it; if <lb/>
you was to put it in there, people would think it was a <lb/>
drygoods box.</p>
<p>What I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was <lb/>
interested in dervishes on accounts of the one that <lb/>
played the trick on the camel-driver. So we found a <lb/>
lot in a kind of a church, and they called themselves <lb/>
Whirling Dervishes; and they did whirl, too. I never <lb/>
see anything like it. They had tall sugar-loaf hats on, <lb/>
and linen petticoats; and they spun and spun and <lb/>
spun, round and round like tops, and the petticoats <lb/>
stood out on a slant, and it was the prettiest thing I <lb/>
ever see, and made me drunk to look at it. They was <lb/>
all Moslems, Tom said, and when I asked him what a <lb/>
Moslem was, he said it was a person that wasn't a <lb/>
Presbyterian. So there is plenty of them in Missouri, <lb/>
though I didn't know it before.</p>
<p>We didn't see half there was to see in Cairo, because <lb/>
Tom was in such a sweat to hunt out places that was <lb/>
celebrated in history. We had a most tiresome time to <lb/>
find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain <lb/>
before the famine, and when we found it it warn't <lb/>
worth much to look at, being such an old tumble-down <lb/>
wreck; but Tom was satisfied, and made more fuss over <lb/>
it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot. <lb/>
How he ever found that place was too many for me. <lb/>
We passed as much as forty just like it before we come <lb/>
to it, and any of them would 'a' done for me, but none <lb/>
but just the right one would suit him; I never see any- <lb/>
body so particular as Tom Sawyer. The minute he <lb/>
<pb n="130"/>
struck the right one he reconnized it as easy as I would <lb/>
reconnize my other shirt if I had one, but how he done <lb/>
it he couldn't any more tell than he could fly; he said <lb/>
so himself.</p>
<p>Then we hunted a long time for the house where the <lb/>
boy lived that learned the cadi how to try the case of <lb/>
the old olives and the new ones, and said it was out of <lb/>
the Arabian Nights, and he would tell me and Jim <lb/>
about it when he got time. Well, we hunted and <lb/>
hunted till I was ready to drop, and I wanted Tom to <lb/>
give it up and come next day and git somebody that <lb/>
knowed the town and could talk Missourian and could <lb/>
go straight to the place; but no, he wanted to find it <lb/>
himself, and nothing else would answer. So on we <lb/>
went. Then at last the remarkablest thing happened I <lb/>
ever see. The house was gone&#x2014;gone hundreds of <lb/>
years ago&#x2014;every last rag of it gone but just one mud <lb/>
brick. Now a person wouldn't ever believe that a <lb/>
backwoods Missouri boy that hadn't ever been in that <lb/>
town before could go and hunt that place over and find <lb/>
that brick, but Tom Sawyer done it. I know he done <lb/>
it, because I see him do it. I was right by his very <lb/>
side at the time, and see him see the brick and see him <lb/>
reconnize it. Well, I says to myself, how <i>does</i> he do <lb/>
it? Is it knowledge, or is it instink?</p>
<p>Now there's the facts, just as they happened: let <lb/>
everybody explain it their own way. I've ciphered <lb/>
over it a good deal, and it's my opinion that some of it <lb/>
is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink. The <lb/>
reason is this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give <lb/>
<pb n="131"/>
to a museum with his name on it and the facts when he <lb/>
went home, and I slipped it out and put another brick <lb/>
considerable like it in its place, and he didn't know the <lb/>
difference&#x2014;but there was a difference, you see. I <lb/>
think that settles it&#x2014;it's mostly instink, not knowledge. <lb/>
Instink tells him where the exact <i>place</i> is for the brick to <lb/>
be in, and so he reconnizes it by the place it's in, not <lb/>
by the look of the brick. If it was knowledge, not <lb/>
instink, he would know the brick again by the look of <lb/>
it the next time he seen it&#x2014;which he didn't. So it <lb/>
shows that for all the brag you hear about knowledge <lb/>
being such a wonderful thing, instink is worth forty of <lb/>
it for real unerringness. Jim says the same.</p>
<p>When we got back Jim dropped down and took us <lb/>
in, and there was a young man there with a red skull- <lb/>
cap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket and baggy <lb/>
trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it <lb/>
that could talk English and wanted to hire to us as <lb/>
guide and take us to Mecca and Medina and Central <lb/>
Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar a day and his <lb/>
keep, and we hired him and left, and piled on the <lb/>
power, and by the time we was through dinner we was <lb/>
over the place where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea <lb/>
when Pharaoh tried to overtake them and was caught <lb/>
by the waters. We stopped, then, and had a good <lb/>
look at the place, and it done Jim good to see it. He <lb/>
said he could see it all, now, just the way it happened; <lb/>
he could see the Israelites walking along between the <lb/>
walls of water, and the Egyptians coming, from away <lb/>
off yonder, hurrying all they could, and see them start <lb/>
<pb n="132"/>
in as the Israelites went out, and then when they was <lb/>
all in, see the walls tumble together and drown the last <lb/>
man of them. Then we piled on the power again and <lb/>
rushed away and huvvered over Mount Sinai, and saw <lb/>
the place where Moses broke the tables of stone, and <lb/>
where the children of Israel camped in the plain and <lb/>
worshiped the golden calf, and it was all <unclear>just'</unclear> as <lb/>
interesting as could be, and the guide knowed every <lb/>
place as well as I knowed the village at home.</p>
<p>But we had an accident, now, and it fetched all the <lb/>
plans to a standstill. Tom's old ornery corn-cob pipe <lb/>
had got so old and swelled and warped that she couldn't <lb/>
hold together any longer, notwithstanding the strings <lb/>
and bandages, but caved in and went to pieces. Tom <lb/>
he didn't know <i>what</i> to do. The professor's pipe <lb/>
wouldn't answer; it warn't anything but a mershum, <lb/>
and a person that's got used to a cob pipe knows it <lb/>
lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world, <lb/>
and you can't git him to smoke any other. He <lb/>
wouldn't take mine, I couldn't persuade him. So <lb/>
there he was.</p>
<p>He thought it over, and said we must scour around <lb/>
and see if we could roust out one in Egypt or Arabia or <lb/>
around in some of these countries, but the guide said no, <lb/>
it warn't no use, they didn't have them. So Tom was <lb/>
pretty glum for a little while, then he chirked up and said <lb/>
he'd got the idea and knowed what to do. He says:</p>
<p>"I've got another corn-cob pipe, and it's a prime <lb/>
one, too, and nearly new. It's laying on the rafter <lb/>
that's right over the kitchen stove at home in the <lb/>
<pb n="133"/>
village. Jim, you and the guide will go and get it, <lb/>
and me and Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till <lb/>
you come back."</p>
<p>"But, Mars Tom, we couldn't ever find de village. <lb/>
I could find de pipe, 'case I knows de kitchen, but my <lb/>
lan', <i>we</i> can't ever find de village, nur Sent Louis, nur <lb/>
none o' dem places. We don't know de way, Mars <lb/>
Tom."</p>
<p>That was a fact, and it stumped Tom for a minute. <lb/>
Then he said:</p>
<p>"Looky here, it can be done, sure; and I'll tell you <lb/>
how. You set your compass and sail west as straight <lb/>
as a dart, till you find the United States. It ain't any <lb/>
trouble, because it's the first land you'll strike the other <lb/>
side of the Atlantic. If it's daytime when you strike it, <lb/>
bulge right on, straight west from the upper part of the <lb/>
Florida coast, and in an hour and three quarters you'll <lb/>
hit the mouth of the Mississippi&#x2014;at the speed that <lb/>
I'm going to send you. You'll be so high up in the <lb/>
air that the earth will be curved considerable&#x2014;sorter <lb/>
like a washbowl turned upside down&#x2014;and you'll see a <lb/>
raft of rivers crawling around every which way, long <lb/>
before you get there, and you can pick out the Miss- <lb/>
issippi without any trouble. Then you can follow the <lb/>
river north nearly, an hour and three quarters, till you <lb/>
see the Ohio come in; then you want to look sharp, <lb/>
because you're getting near. Away up to your left <lb/>
you'll see another thread coming in&#x2014;that's the <lb/>
Missouri and is a little above St. Louis. You'll come <lb/>
down low then, so as you can examine the villages as <lb/>
<pb n="134"/>
you spin along. You'll pass about twenty-five in the <lb/>
next fifteen minutes, and you'll recognize ours when <lb/>
you see it&#x2014;and if you don't, you can yell down and <lb/>
ask."</p>
<p>"Ef it's dat easy, Mars Tom, I reckon we kin do <lb/>
it&#x2014;yassir, I knows we kin."</p>
<p>The guide was sure of it, too, and thought that he <lb/>
could learn to stand his watch in a little while.</p>
<p>"Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an <lb/>
hour," Tom said. "This balloon's as easy to manage <lb/>
as a canoe."</p>
<p>Tom got out the chart and marked out the course <lb/>
and measured it, and says:</p>
<p>"To go back west is the shortest way, you see. <lb/>
It's only about seven thousand miles. If you went <lb/>
east, and so on around, it's over twice as far." Then <lb/>
he says to the guide, "I want you both to watch the <lb/>
tell-tale all through the watches, and whenever it don't <lb/>
mark three hundred miles an hour, you go higher or <lb/>
drop lower till you find a storm-current that's going <lb/>
your way. There's a hundred miles an hour in this <lb/>
old thing without any wind to help. There's two- <lb/>
hundred-mile gales to be found, any time you want to <lb/>
hunt for them."</p>
<p>"We'll hunt for them, sir."</p>
<p>"See that you do. Sometimes you may have to <lb/>
go up a couple of miles, and it'll be p'ison cold, but <lb/>
most of the time you'll find your storm a good deal <lb/>
lower. If you can only strike a cyclone&#x2014;that's the <lb/>
ticket for you! You'll see by the professor's books <lb/>
<pb/>
<figure/>
<pb/>
<pb n="135"/>
that they travel west in these latitudes; and they travel <lb/>
low, too."</p>
<p>Then he ciphered on the time, and says&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Seven thousand miles, three hundred miles an <lb/>
hour&#x2014;you can make the trip in a day&#x2014;twenty-four <lb/>
hours. This is Thursday; you'll be back here Sat- <lb/>
urday afternoon. Come, now, hustle out some blankets <lb/>
and food and books and things for me and Huck, and <lb/>
you can start right along. There ain't no occasion to <lb/>
fool around&#x2014;I want a smoke, and the quicker you <lb/>
fetch that pipe the better."</p>
<p>All hands jumped for the things, and in eight min- <lb/>
utes our things was out and the balloon was ready for <lb/>
America. So we shook hands good-bye, and Tom <lb/>
gave his last orders:</p>
<p>"It's 10 minutes to 2 <smcap>p.m.</smcap> now, Mount Sinai time. <lb/>
In 24 hours you'll be home, and it 'll be 6 to-mor- <lb/>
row morning, village time. When you strike the <lb/>
village, land a little back of the top of the hill, in the <lb/>
woods, out of sight; then you rush down, Jim, and <lb/>
shove these letters in the post-office, and if you see <lb/>
anybody stirring, pull your slouch down over your face <lb/>
so they won't know you. Then you go and slip in the <lb/>
back way to the kitchen and git the pipe, and lay this <lb/>
piece of paper on the kitchen table, and put something <lb/>
on it to hold it, and then slide out and git away, and <lb/>
don't let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody <lb/>
else. Then you jump for the balloon and shove for <lb/>
Mount Sinai three hundred miles an hour. You won't <lb/>
have lost more than an hour. You'll start back at 7 or <lb/>
<pb n="136"/>
8 <smcap>a.m.</smcap>, village time, and be here in 24 hours, arriving <lb/>
at 2 or 3 <smcap>p.m.</smcap>, Mount Sinai time."</p>
<p>Tom he read the piece of paper to us. He had <lb/>
wrote on it:</p>
<quotedLetter>
<p>"<smcap>Thursday Afternoon</smcap>. <i>Tom Sawyer the Erro- <lb/>
nort sends his love to Aunt Polly from Mount Sinai <lb/>
where the Ark was, and so does Huck Finn, and she <lb/>
will get it to-morrow morning half-past six</i>.<ref target="n1">*</ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck's error, not Tom's, <lb/>
&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></p>
<closer>
<signed>"<smcap>Tom Sawyer the Erronort</smcap>."</signed>
</closer>
</quotedLetter>
<p>"That'll make her eyes bulge out and the tears <lb/>
come," he says. Then he says:</p>
<p>"Stand by! One&#x2014;two&#x2014;three&#x2014;away you go!"</p>
<p>And away she <i>did</i> go! Why, she seemed to whiz <lb/>
out of sight in a second.</p>
<p>Then we found a most comfortable cave that looked <lb/>
out over the whole big plain, and there we camped to <lb/>
wait for the pipe.</p>
<p>The balloon come back all right, and brung the pipe; <lb/>
but Aunt Polly had catched Jim when he was getting <lb/>
it, and anybody can guess what happened: she sent <lb/>
for Tom. So Jim he says:</p>
<p>"Mars Tom, she's out on de porch wid her eye sot on <lb/>
de sky a-layin' for you, en she say she ain't gwyne to <lb/>
budge from dah tell she gits hold of you. Dey's gwyne <lb/>
to be trouble, Mars Tom, 'deed dey is."</p>
<p>So then we shoved for home, and not feeling very <lb/>
gay, neither.</p>

<head><smcap>an invitation for tom and huck</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Well</smcap>, it was the next spring after me and Tom <lb/>
Sawyer set our old nigger Jim free, the time he <lb/>
was chained up for a runaway slave down there on <lb/>
Tom's uncle Silas's farm in Arkansaw. The frost was <lb/>
working out of the ground, and out of the air, too, and <lb/>
it was getting closer and closer onto barefoot time every <lb/>
day; and next it would be marble time, and next <lb/>
mumbletypeg, and next tops and hoops, and next <lb/>
kites, and then right away it would be summer and go- <lb/>
ing in a-swimming. It just makes a boy homesick to <lb/>
look ahead like that and see how far off summer is. <lb/>
Yes, and it sets him to sighing and saddening around, <lb/>
and there's something the matter with him, he don't <lb/>
know what. But anyway, he gets out by himself and <lb/>
<pb n="138"/>
mopes and thinks; and mostly he hunts for a lone, <lb/>
some place high up on the hill in the edge of the woods, <lb/>
and sets there and looks away off on the big Mississippi <lb/>
down there a-reaching miles and miles around the points <lb/>
where the timber looks smoky and dim it's so far off and <lb/>
still, and everything's so solemn it seems like everybody <lb/>
you've loved is dead and gone, and you 'most wish you <lb/>
was dead and gone too, and done with it all.</p>
<p>Don't you know what that is? It's spring fever. <lb/>
That is what the name of it is. And when you've got <lb/>
it, you want&#x2014;oh, you don't quite know what it is you <lb/>
<i>do</i> want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you <lb/>
want it so! It seems to you that mainly what you want <lb/>
is to get away; get away from the same old tedious <lb/>
things you're so used to seeing and so tired of, and see <lb/>
something new. That is the idea; you want to go and <lb/>
be a wanderer; you want to go wandering far away to <lb/>
strange countries where everything is mysterious and <lb/>
wonderful and romantic. And if you can't do that, <lb/>
you'll put up with considerable less; you'll go any- <lb/>
where you <i>can</i> go, just so as to get away, and be thank- <lb/>
ful of the chance, too.</p>
<p>Well, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and <lb/>
had it bad, too; but it warn't any use to think about <lb/>
Tom trying to get away, because, as he said, his Aunt <lb/>
Polly wouldn't let him quit school and go traipsing off <lb/>
somers wasting time; so we was pretty blue. We was <lb/>
setting on the front steps one day about sundown talk- <lb/>
ing this way, when out comes his aunt Polly with a <lb/>
letter in her hand and says:</p>
<pb/>
<figure>
<head>"I RECKON I GOT TO BE EXCUSED"</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="139"/>
<p>"Tom, I reckon you've got to pack up and go down <lb/>
to Arkansaw&#x2014;your aunt Sally wants you."</p>
<p>I 'most jumped out of my skin for joy. I reckoned <lb/>
Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head off; but if <lb/>
you believe me he set there like a rock, and never said <lb/>
a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish, <lb/>
with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, <lb/>
we might lose it if he didn't speak up and show he was <lb/>
thankful and grateful. But he set there and studied <lb/>
and studied till I was that distressed I didn't know <lb/>
what to do; then he says, very ca'm, and I could a <lb/>
shot him for it:</p>
<p>"Well," he says, "I'm right down sorry, Aunt <lb/>
Polly, but I reckon I got to be excused&#x2014;for the <lb/>
present."</p>
<p>His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at <lb/>
the cold impudence of it that she couldn't say a word <lb/>
for as much as a half a minute, and this gave me a <lb/>
chance to nudge Tom and whisper:</p>
<p>"Ain't you got any sense? Sp'iling such a noble <lb/>
chance as this and throwing it away?"</p>
<p>But he warn't disturbed. He mumbled back:</p>
<p>"Huck Finn, do you want me to let her <i>see</i> how bad <lb/>
I want to go? Why, she'd begin to doubt, right <lb/>
away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers and <lb/>
objections, and first you know she'd take it all back. <lb/>
You lemme alone; I reckon I know how to work her."</p>
<p>Now I never would 'a' thought of that. But he was <lb/>
right. Tom Sawyer was always right&#x2014;the levelest <lb/>
head I ever see, and always <i>at</i> himself and ready for <lb/>
<pb n="140"/>
anything you might spring on him. By this time his <lb/>
aunt Polly was all straight again, and she let fly. She <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"You'll be excused! <i>You</i> will! Well, I never <lb/>
heard the like of it in all my days! The idea of you <lb/>
talking like that to <i>me!</i> Now take yourself off and <lb/>
pack your traps; and if I hear another word out of <lb/>
you about what you'll be excused from and what you <lb/>
won't, I lay <i>I'll</i> excuse you&#x2014;with a hickory!"</p>
<p>She hit his head a thump with her thimble as we <lb/>
dodged by, and he let on to be whimpering as we <lb/>
struck for the stairs. Up in his room he hugged me, <lb/>
he was so out of his head for gladness because he was <lb/>
going traveling. And he says:</p>
<p>"Before we get away she'll wish she hadn't let me <lb/>
go, but she won't know any way to get around it now. <lb/>
After what she's said, her pride won't let her take it <lb/>
back."</p>
<p>Tom was packed in ten minutes, all except what his <lb/>
aunt and Mary would finish up for him; then we waited <lb/>
ten more for her to get cooled down and sweet and <lb/>
gentle again; for Tom said it took her ten minutes to <lb/>
unruffle in times when half of her feathers was up, but <lb/>
twenty when they was all up, and this was one of the <lb/>
times when they was all up. Then we went down, <lb/>
being in a sweat to know what the letter said.</p>
<p>She was setting there in a brown study, with it laying <lb/>
in her lap. We set down, and she says:</p>
<p>"They're in considerable trouble down there, and <lb/>
they think you and Huck 'll be a kind of diversion for <lb/>
<pb n="141"/>
them&#x2014;'comfort,' they say. Much of that they'll get <lb/>
out of you and Huck Finn, I reckon. There's a neigh- <lb/>
bor named Brace Dunlap that's been wanting to marry <lb/>
their Benny for three months, and at last they told him <lb/>
pint blank and once for all, he <i>couldn't;</i> so he has soured <lb/>
on them, and they're worried about it. I reckon he's <lb/>
somebody they think they better be on the good side <lb/>
of, for they've tried to please him by hiring his no- <lb/>
account brother to help on the farm when they can't <lb/>
hardly afford it, and don't want him around anyhow. <lb/>
Who are the Dunlaps?"</p>
<p>"They live about a mile from Uncle Silas's place, <lb/>
Aunt Polly&#x2014;all the farmers live about a mile apart <lb/>
down there&#x2014;and Brace Dunlap is a long sight richer <lb/>
than any of the others, and owns a whole grist of nig- <lb/>
gers. He's a widower, thirty-six years old, without <lb/>
any children, and is proud of his money and overbear- <lb/>
ing, and everybody is a little afraid of him. I judge he <lb/>
thought he could have any girl he wanted, just for the <lb/>
asking, and it must have set him back a good deal when <lb/>
he found he couldn't get Benny. Why, Benny's only <lb/>
half as old as he is, and just as sweet and lovely as&#x2014; <lb/>
well, you've seen her. Poor old Uncle Silas&#x2014;why, <lb/>
it's pitiful, him trying to curry favor that way&#x2014;so hard <lb/>
pushed and poor, and yet hiring that useless Jubiter <lb/>
Dunlap to please his ornery brother."</p>
<p>"What a name&#x2014;Jubiter! Where'd he get it?"</p>
<p>"It's only just a nickname. I reckon they've forgot <lb/>
his real name long before this. He's twenty-seven, <lb/>
now, and has had it ever since the first time he ever <lb/>
<pb n="142"/>
went in swimming. The school teacher seen a round <lb/>
brown mole the size of a dime on his left leg above his <lb/>
knee, and four little bits of moles around it, when he <lb/>
was naked, and he said it minded him of Jubiter and <lb/>
his moons; and the children thought it was funny, and <lb/>
so they got to calling him Jubiter, and he's Jubiter yet. <lb/>
He's tall, and lazy, and sly, and sneaky, and ruther <lb/>
cowardly, too, but kind of good-natured, and wears <lb/>
long brown hair and no beard, and hasn't got a cent, <lb/>
and Brace boards him for nothing, and gives him his old <lb/>
clothes to wear, and despises him. Jubiter is a twin."</p>
<p>"What's t'other twin like?"</p>
<p>"Just exactly like Jubiter&#x2014;so they say; used to <lb/>
was, anyway, but he hain't been seen for seven years. <lb/>
He got to robbing when he was nineteen or twenty, <lb/>
and they jailed him; but he broke jail and got away&#x2014; <lb/>
up North here, somers. They used to hear about him <lb/>
robbing and burglaring now and then, but that was <lb/>
years ago. He's dead, now. At least that's what <lb/>
they say. They don't hear about him any more."</p>
<p>"What was his name?"</p>
<p>"Jake."</p>
<p>There wasn't anything more said for a considerable <lb/>
while; the old lady was thinking. At last she says:</p>
<p>"The thing that is mostly worrying your aunt Sally <lb/>
is the tempers that that man Jubiter gets your uncle <lb/>
into."</p>
<p>Tom was astonished, and so was I. Tom says:</p>
<p>"Tempers? Uncle Silas? Land, you must be jok- <lb/>
ing! I didn't know he <i>had</i> any temper."</p>
<pb n="143"/>
<p>"Works him up into perfect rages, your aunt Sally <lb/>
says; says he acts as if he would really hit the man, <lb/>
sometimes."</p>
<p>"Aunt Polly, it beats anything I ever heard of. <lb/>
Why, he's just as gentle as mush."</p>
<p>"Well, she's worried, anyway. Says your uncle <lb/>
Silas is like a changed man, on account of all this <lb/>
quarreling. And the neighbors talk about it, and lay <lb/>
all the blame on your uncle, of course, because he's a <lb/>
preacher and hain't got any business to quarrel. Your <lb/>
aunt Sally says he hates to go into the pulpit he's so <lb/>
ashamed; and the people have begun to cool toward <lb/>
him, and he ain't as popular now as he used to was."</p>
<p>"Well, ain't it strange? Why, Aunt Polly, he was <lb/>
always so good and kind and moony and absent-minded <lb/>
and chuckle-headed and lovable&#x2014;why, he was just an <lb/>
angel! What <i>can</i> be the matter of him, do you <lb/>
reckon?"</p>

<p><smcap>We</smcap> had powerful good luck; because we got a <lb/>
chance in a stern-wheeler from away North which <lb/>
was bound for one of them bayous or one-horse rivers <lb/>
away down Louisiana way, and so we could go all the <lb/>
way down the Upper Mississippi and all the way down <lb/>
the Lower Mississippi to that farm in Arkansaw with- <lb/>
out having to change steamboats at St. Louis; not so <lb/>
very much short of a thousand miles at one pull.</p>
<p>A pretty lonesome boat; there warn't but few <lb/>
passengers, and all old folks, that set around, wide <lb/>
apart, dozing, and was very quiet. We was four days <lb/>
getting out of the "upper river," because we got <lb/>
aground so much. But it warn't dull&#x2014;couldn't be <lb/>
for boys that was traveling, of course.</p>
<p>From the very start me and Tom allowed that there <lb/>
was somebody sick in the stateroom next to ourn, be- <lb/>
cause the meals was always toted in there by the wait- <lb/>
ers. By and by we asked about it&#x2014;Tom did&#x2014;and <lb/>
the waiter said it was a man, but he didn't look sick.</p>
<p>"Well, but <i>ain't</i> he sick?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; maybe he is, but 'pears to me he's <lb/>
just letting on."</p>
<pb n="145"/>
<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>
<p>"Because if he was sick he would pull his clothes off <lb/>
<i>some</i> time or other&#x2014;don't you reckon he would? <lb/>
Well, this one don't. At least he don't ever pull off <lb/>
his boots, anyway."</p>
<p>"The mischief he don't! Not even when he goes <lb/>
to bed?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>It was always nuts for Tom Sawyer&#x2014;a mystery was. <lb/>
If you'd lay out a mystery and a pie before me and <lb/>
him, you wouldn't have to say take your choice; it <lb/>
was a thing that would regulate itself. Because in my <lb/>
nature I have always run to pie, whilst in his nature he <lb/>
has always run to mystery. People are made different. <lb/>
And it is the best way. Tom says to the waiter:</p>
<p>"What's the man's name?"</p>
<p>"Phillips."</p>
<p>"Where'd he come aboard?"</p>
<p>"I think he got aboard at Elexandria, up on the <lb/>
Iowa line."</p>
<p>"What do you reckon he's a-playing?"</p>
<p>"I hain't any notion&#x2014;I never thought of it."</p>
<p>I says to myself, here's another one that runs to pie.</p>
<p>"Anything peculiar about him?&#x2014;the way he acts or <lb/>
talks?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;nothing, except he seems so scary, and <lb/>
keeps his doors locked night and day both, and when <lb/>
you knock he won't let you in till he opens the door a <lb/>
crack and sees who it is."</p>
<p>"By jimminy, it's int' resting! I'd like to get a <lb/>
<pb n="146"/>
look at him. Say&#x2014;the next time you're going in <lb/>
there, don't you reckon you could spread the door <lb/>
and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No, indeedy! He's always behind it. He would <lb/>
block that game."</p>
<p>Tom studied over it, and then he says:</p>
<p>"Looky here. You lend me your apern and let me <lb/>
take him his breakfast in the morning. I'll give you a <lb/>
quarter."</p>
<p>The boy was plenty willing enough, if the head <lb/>
steward wouldn't mind. Tom says that's all right, he <lb/>
reckoned he could fix it with the head steward; and he <lb/>
done it. He fixed it so as we could both go in with <lb/>
aperns on and toting vittles.</p>
<p>He didn't sleep much, he was in such a sweat to get <lb/>
in there and find out the mystery about Phillips; and <lb/>
moreover he done a lot of guessing about it all night, <lb/>
which warn't no use, for if you are going to find out <lb/>
the facts of a thing, what's the sense in guessing out <lb/>
what ain't the facts and wasting ammunition? I <lb/>
didn't lose no sleep. I wouldn't give a dern to know <lb/>
what's the matter of Phillips, I says to myself.</p>
<p>Well, in the morning we put on the aperns and got a <lb/>
couple of trays of truck, and Tom he knocked on the <lb/>
door. The man opened it a crack, and then he let us in <lb/>
and shut it quick. By Jackson, when we got a sight of <lb/>
him, we 'most dropped the trays! and Tom says:</p>
<p>"Why, Jubiter Dunlap, where'd <i>you</i> come from?"</p>
<p>Well, the man was astonished, of course; and first <lb/>
off he looked like he didn't know whether to be scared, <lb/>
<pb n="147"/>
or glad, or both, or which, but finally he settled down <lb/>
to being glad; and then his color come back, though at <lb/>
first his face had turned pretty white. So we got to <lb/>
talking together while he et his breakfast. And he <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"But I aint Jubiter Dunlap. I'd just as soon tell <lb/>
you who I am, though, if you'll swear to keep mum, <lb/>
for I ain't no Phillips, either."</p>
<p>Tom says:</p>
<p>"We'll keep mum, but there ain't any need to tell <lb/>
who you are if you ain't Jubiter Dunlap."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because if you ain't him you're t'other twin, Jake. <lb/>
You're the spit'n image of Jubiter."</p>
<p>"Well, I <i>am</i> Jake. But looky here, how do you <lb/>
come to know us Dunlaps?"</p>
<p>Tom told about the adventures we'd had down there <lb/>
at his uncle Silas's last summer,and when he see that <lb/>
there warn't anything about his folks&#x2014;or him either, <lb/>
for that matter&#x2014;that we didn't know, he opened out <lb/>
and talked perfectly free and candid. He never made <lb/>
any bones about his own case; said he'd been a hard <lb/>
lot, was a hard lot yet, and reckoned he'd <i>be</i> a hard lot <lb/>
plumb to the end. He said of course it was a danger- <lb/>
ous life, and&#x2014;</p>
<p>He give a kind of gasp, and set his head like a person <lb/>
that's listening. We didn't say anything, and so it <lb/>
was very still for a second or so, and there warn't no <lb/>
sounds but the screaking of the woodwork and the chug- <lb/>
chugging of the machinery down below.</p>
<pb n="148"/>
<p>Then we got him comfortable again, telling him about <lb/>
his people, and how Brace's wife had been dead three <lb/>
years, and Brace wanted to marry Benny and she shook <lb/>
him, and Jubiter was working for Uncle Silas, and him <lb/>
and Uncle Silas quarreling all the time&#x2014;and then he <lb/>
let go and laughed.</p>
<p>"Land!" he says, "it's like old times to hear all <lb/>
this tittle-tattle, and does me good. It's been seven <lb/>
years and more since I heard any. How do they talk <lb/>
about me these days?"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"The farmers&#x2014;and the family."</p>
<p>"Why, they don't talk about you at all&#x2014;at least <lb/>
only just a mention, once in a long time."</p>
<p>"The nation!" he says, surprised; "why is that?"</p>
<p>"Because they think you are dead long ago."</p>
<p>"No! Are you speaking true?&#x2014;honor bright, <lb/>
now." He jumped up, excited.</p>
<p>"Honor bright. There ain't anybody thinks you are <lb/>
alive."</p>
<p>"Then I'm saved, I'm saved, sure! I'll go home. <lb/>
They'll hide me and save my life. You keep mum. <lb/>
Swear you'll keep mum&#x2014;swear you'll never, never tell <lb/>
on me. Oh, boys, be good to a poor devil that's being <lb/>
hunted day and night, and dasn't show his face! I've <lb/>
never done you any harm; I'll never do you any, as <lb/>
God is in the heavens; swear you'll be good to me <lb/>
and help me save my life."</p>
<p>We'd a swore it if he'd been a dog; and so we done <lb/>
it. Well, he couldn't love us enough for it or be grate- <lb/>
<pb n="149"/>
ful enough, poor cuss; it was all he could do to keep <lb/>
from hugging us.</p>
<p>We talked along, and he got out a little hand-bag <lb/>
and begun to open it, and told us to turn our backs. <lb/>
We done it, and when he told us to turn again he was <lb/>
perfectly different to what he was before. He had on <lb/>
blue goggles and the naturalest-looking long brown <lb/>
whiskers and mustashes you ever see. His own <lb/>
mother wouldn't 'a' knowed him. He asked us if he <lb/>
looked like his brother Jubiter, now.</p>
<p>"No," Tom said; "there ain't anything left that's <lb/>
like him except the long hair."</p>
<p>"All right, I'll get that cropped close to my head be- <lb/>
fore I get there; then him and Brace will keep my <lb/>
secret, and I'll live with them as being a stranger, and <lb/>
the neighbors won't ever guess me out. What do you <lb/>
think?"</p>
<p>Tom he studied awhile, then he says:</p>
<p>"Well, of course me and Huck are going to keep <lb/>
mum there, but if you don't keep mum yourself there's <lb/>
going to be a little bit of a risk&#x2014;it ain't much, maybe, <lb/>
but it's a little. I mean, if you talk, won't people <lb/>
notice that your voice is just like Jubiter's; and <lb/>
mightn't it make them think of the twin they reckoned <lb/>
was dead, but maybe after all was hid all this time <lb/>
under another name?"</p>
<p>"By George," he says, "you're a sharp one! <lb/>
You're perfectly right. I've got to play deef and <lb/>
dumb when there's a neighbor around. If I'd a struck <lb/>
for home and forgot that little detail&#x2014; However, I <lb/>
<pb n="150"/>
wasn't striking for home. I was breaking for any <lb/>
place where I could get away from these fellows that <lb/>
are after me; then I was going to put on this disguise <lb/>
and get some different clothes, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>He jumped for the outside door and laid his ear <lb/>
against it and listened, pale and kind of panting. <lb/>
Presently he whispers:</p>
<p>"Sounded like cocking a gun! Lord, what a life to <lb/>
lead!"</p>
<p>Then he sunk down in a chair all limp and sick like, <lb/>
and wiped the sweat off of his face.</p>

<head><smcap>a diamond robbery</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>From</smcap> that time out, we was with him 'most all the <lb/>
time, and one or t'other of us slept in his upper <lb/>
berth. He said he had been so lonesome, and it was <lb/>
such a comfort to him to have company, and somebody <lb/>
to talk to in his troubles. We was in a sweat to find <lb/>
out what his secret was, but Tom said the best way was <lb/>
not to seem anxious, then likely he would drop into it <lb/>
himself in one of his talks, but if we got to asking <lb/>
questions he would get suspicious and shet up his shell. <lb/>
It turned out just so. It warn't no trouble to see that <lb/>
he <i>wanted</i> to talk about it, but always along at first he <lb/>
would scare away from it when he got on the very edge <lb/>
of it, and go to talking about something else. The <lb/>
way it come about was this: He got to asking us, <lb/>
kind of indifferent like, about the passengers down on <lb/>
deck. We told him about them. But he warn't satis- <lb/>
fied; we warn't particular enough. He told us to de- <lb/>
scribe them better. Tom done it. At last, when Tom <lb/>
was describing one of the roughest and raggedest ones, <lb/>
he gave a shiver and a gasp and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, lordy, that's one of them! They're aboard <lb/>
<pb n="152"/>
sure&#x2014;I just knowed it. I sort of hoped I had got <lb/>
away, but I never believed it. Go on."</p>
<p>Presently when Tom was describing another mangy, <lb/>
rough deck passenger, he give that shiver again and <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"That's him!&#x2014; that's the other one. If it would <lb/>
only come a good black stormy night and I could get <lb/>
ashore. You see, they've got spies on me. They've <lb/>
got a right to come up and buy drinks at the bar <lb/>
yonder forrard, and they take that chance to bribe <lb/>
somebody to keep watch on me&#x2014;porter or boots or <lb/>
somebody. If I was to slip ashore without anybody <lb/>
seeing me, they would know it inside of an hour."</p>
<p>So then he got to wandering along, and pretty soon, <lb/>
sure enough, he was telling! He was poking along <lb/>
through his ups and downs, and when he come to that <lb/>
place he went right along. He says:</p>
<p>"It was a confidence game. We played it on a julery- <lb/>
shop in St. Louis. What we was after was a couple of <lb/>
noble big di'monds as big as hazel-nuts, which every- <lb/>
body was running to see. We was dressed up fine, and <lb/>
we played it on them in broad daylight. We ordered <lb/>
the di'monds sent to the hotel for us to see if we <lb/>
wanted to buy, and when we was examining them we <lb/>
had paste counterfeits all ready, and <i>them</i> was the things <lb/>
that went back to the shop when we said the water <lb/>
wasn't quite fine enough for twelve thousand dollars."</p>
<p>"Twelve&#x2014;thousand&#x2014;dollars!" Tom says. "Was <lb/>
they really worth all that money, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>"Every cent of it."</p>
<pb n="153"/>
<p>"And you fellows got away with them?"</p>
<p>"As easy as nothing. I don't reckon the julery <lb/>
people know they've been robbed yet. But it wouldn't <lb/>
be good sense to stay around St. Louis, of course, so <lb/>
we considered where we'd go. One was for going one <lb/>
way, one another, so we throwed up, heads or tails, <lb/>
and the Upper Mississippi won. We done up the <lb/>
di'monds in a paper and put our names on it and put <lb/>
it in the keep of the hotel clerk, and told him not to <lb/>
ever let either of us have it again without the others was <lb/>
on hand to see it done; then we went down town, each <lb/>
by his own self&#x2014;because I reckon maybe we all had <lb/>
the same notion. I don't know for certain, but I <lb/>
reckon maybe we had."</p>
<p>"What notion?" Tom says.</p>
<p>"To rob the others."</p>
<p>"What&#x2014;one take everything, after all of you had <lb/>
helped to get it?"</p>
<p>"Cert'nly."</p>
<p>It disgusted Tom Sawyer, and he said it was the <lb/>
orneriest, low-downest thing he ever heard of. But <lb/>
Jake Dunlap said it warn't unusual in the profession. <lb/>
Said when a person was in that line of business he'd <lb/>
got to look out for his own intrust, there warn't no- <lb/>
body else going to do it for him. And then he went <lb/>
on. He says:</p>
<p>"You see, the trouble was, you couldn't divide up <lb/>
two di'monds amongst three. If there'd been three&#x2014; <lb/>
But never mind about that, there <i>warn't</i> three. I <lb/>
loafed along the back streets studying and studying. <lb/>
<pb n="154"/>
And I says to myself, I'll hog them di'monds the first <lb/>
chance I get, and I'll have a disguise all ready, and I'll <lb/>
give the boys the slip, and when I'm safe away I'll put <lb/>
it on, and then let them find me if they can. So I got <lb/>
the false whiskers and the goggles and this countrified <lb/>
suit of clothes, and fetched them along back in a hand- <lb/>
bag; and when I was passing a shop where they sell all <lb/>
sorts of things, I got a glimpse of one of my pals <lb/>
through the window. It was Bud Dixon. I was glad, <lb/>
you bet. I says to myself, I'll see what he buys. So <lb/>
I kept shady, and watched. Now what do you reckon <lb/>
it was he bought?"</p>
<p>"Whiskers?" said I.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Goggles?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Oh, keep still, Huck Finn, can't you, you're only <lb/>
just hendering all you can. What <i>was</i> it he bought, <lb/>
Jake?"</p>
<p>"You'd never guess in the world. It was only just <lb/>
a screwdriver&#x2014;just a wee little bit of a screwdriver."</p>
<p>"Well, I declare! What did he want with that?"</p>
<p>"That's what <i>I</i> thought. It was curious. It clean <lb/>
stumped me. I says to myself, what can he want with <lb/>
that thing? Well, when he come out I stood back out <lb/>
of sight, and then tracked him to a second-hand slop- <lb/>
shop and see him buy a red flannel shirt and some old <lb/>
ragged clothes&#x2014;just the ones he's got on now, as <lb/>
you've described. Then I went down to the wharf and <lb/>
hid my things aboard the up-river boat that we had <lb/>
<pb n="155"/>
picked out, and then started back and had another <lb/>
streak of luck. I seen our other pal lay in <i>his</i> stock <lb/>
of old rusty second-handers. We got the di'monds <lb/>
and went aboard the boat.</p>
<p>"But now we was up a stump, for we couldn't go <lb/>
to bed. We had to set up and watch one another. <lb/>
Pity, that was; pity to put that kind of a strain on us, <lb/>
because there was bad blood between us from a <lb/>
couple of weeks back, and we was only friends in the <lb/>
way of business. Bad anyway, seeing there was only <lb/>
two di'monds betwixt three men. First we had supper, <lb/>
and then tramped up and down the deck together <lb/>
smoking till most midnight; then we went and set <lb/>
down in my stateroom and locked the doors and looked <lb/>
in the piece of paper to see if the di'monds was all <lb/>
right, then laid it on the lower berth right in full sight; <lb/>
and there we set, and set, and by-and-by it got to be <lb/>
dreadful hard to keep awake. At last Bud Dixon he <lb/>
dropped off. As soon as he was snoring a good regular <lb/>
gait that was likely to last, and had his chin on his <lb/>
breast and looked permanent, Hal Clayton nodded <lb/>
towards the di'monds and then towards the outside <lb/>
door, and I understood. I reached and got the paper, <lb/>
and then we stood up and waited perfectly still; Bud <lb/>
never stirred; I turned the key of the outside door <lb/>
very soft and slow, then turned the knob the same <lb/>
way, and we went tiptoeing out onto the guard, and <lb/>
shut the door very soft and gentle.</p>
<p>"There warn't nobody stirring anywhere, and the <lb/>
boat was slipping along, swift and steady, through the <lb/>
<pb n="156"/>
big water in the smoky moonlight. We never said a <lb/>
word, but went straight up onto the hurricane-deck and <lb/>
plumb back aft, and set down on the end of the sky- <lb/>
light. Both of us knowed what that meant, without <lb/>
having to explain to one another. Bud Dixon would <lb/>
wake up and miss the swag, and would come straight <lb/>
for us, for he ain't afeard of anything or anybody, that <lb/>
man ain't. He would come, and we would heave him <lb/>
overboard, or get killed trying. It made me shiver, <lb/>
because I ain't as brave as some people, but if I <lb/>
showed the white feather&#x2014;well, I knowed better than <lb/>
do that. I kind of hoped the boat would land somers, <lb/>
and we could skip ashore and not have to run the risk <lb/>
of this row, I was so scared of Bud Dixon, but she <lb/>
was an upper-river tub and there warn't no real chance <lb/>
of that.</p>
<p>"Well, the time strung along and along, and that <lb/>
fellow never come! Why, it strung along till dawn <lb/>
begun to break, and still he never come. 'Thunder,' I <lb/>
says, 'what do you make out of this?&#x2014;ain't it sus- <lb/>
picious?' 'Land!' Hal says, 'do you reckon he's <lb/>
playing us?&#x2014;open the paper!' I done it, and by <lb/>
gracious there warn't anything in it but a couple of <lb/>
little pieces of loaf-sugar! <i>That's</i> the reason he could <lb/>
set there and snooze all night so comfortable. Smart? <lb/>
Well, I reckon! He had had them two papers all fixed <lb/>
and ready, and he had put one of them in place of <lb/>
t'other right under our noses.</p>
<p>"We felt pretty cheap. But the thing to do, straight <lb/>
off, was to make a plan; and we done it. We would <lb/>
<pb n="157"/>
do up the paper again, just as it was, and slip in, very <lb/>
elaborate and soft, and lay it on the bunk again, and <lb/>
let on <i>we</i> didn't know about any trick, and hadn't any <lb/>
idea he was a-laughing at us behind them bogus snores <lb/>
of his'n; and we would stick by him, and the first <lb/>
night we was ashore we would get him drunk and <lb/>
search him, and get the di'monds; and <i>do</i> for him, <lb/>
too, if it warn't too risky. If we got the swag, we'd <lb/>
<i>got</i> to do for him, or he would hunt us down and do for <lb/>
us, sure. But I didn't have no real hope. I knowed <lb/>
we could get him drunk&#x2014;he was always ready for <lb/>
that&#x2014;but what's the good of it? You might search <lb/>
him a year and never find&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Well, right there I catched my breath and broke <lb/>
off my thought! For an idea went ripping through my <lb/>
head that tore my brains to rags&#x2014;and land, but I felt <lb/>
gay and good! You see, I had had my boots off, to <lb/>
unswell my feet, and just then I took up one of them <lb/>
to put it on, and I catched a glimpse of the heel- <lb/>
bottom, and it just took my breath away. You re- <lb/>
member about that puzzlesome little screwdriver?"</p>
<p>"You bet I do," says Tom, all excited.</p>
<p>"Well, when I catched that glimpse of that boot <lb/>
heel, the idea that went smashing through my head <lb/>
was, <i>I</i> know where he's hid the di'monds! You look <lb/>
at this boot heel, now. See, it's bottomed with a steel <lb/>
plate, and the plate is fastened on with little screws. <lb/>
Now there wasn't a screw about that feller anywhere <lb/>
but in his boot heels; so, if he needed a screwdriver, <lb/>
I reckoned I knowed why."</p>
<pb n="158"/>
<p>"Huck, ain't it bully!" says Tom.</p>
<p>"Well, I got my boots on, and we went down and <lb/>
slipped in and laid the paper of sugar on the berth, <lb/>
and sat down soft and sheepish and went to listening to <lb/>
Bud Dixon snore. Hal Clayton dropped off pretty <lb/>
soon, but I didn't; I wasn't ever so wide awake in my <lb/>
life. I was spying out from under the shade of my <lb/>
hat brim, searching the floor for leather. It took me a <lb/>
long time, and I begun to think maybe my guess was <lb/>
wrong, but at last I struck it. It laid over by the <lb/>
bulkhead, and was nearly the color of the carpet. It <lb/>
was a little round plug about as thick as the end of your <lb/>
little finger, and I says to myself there's a di'mond in <lb/>
the nest you've come from. Before long I spied out <lb/>
the plug's mate.</p>
<p>"Think of the smartness and coolness of that <lb/>
blatherskite! He put up that scheme on us and <lb/>
reasoned out what we would do, and we went ahead <lb/>
and done it perfectly exact, like a couple of pudd'n- <lb/>
heads. He set there and took his own time to un- <lb/>
screw his heelplates and cut out his plugs and stick in <lb/>
the di'monds and screw on his plates again. He <lb/>
allowed we would steal the bogus swag and wait all <lb/>
night for him to come up and get drownded, and by <lb/>
George it's just what we done! <i>I</i> think it was power- <lb/>
ful smart."</p>
<p>"You bet your life it was!" says Tom, just full of <lb/>
admiration.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the three sleepers</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>"Well</smcap>, all day we went through the humbug of <lb/>
watching one another, and it was pretty sickly <lb/>
business for two of us and hard to act out, I can tell <lb/>
you. About night we landed at one of them little <lb/>
Missouri towns high up toward Iowa, and had supper <lb/>
at the tavern, and got a room upstairs with a cot and a <lb/>
double bed in it, but I dumped my bag under a deal <lb/>
table in the dark hall while we was moving along it to <lb/>
bed, single file, me last, and the landlord in the lead <lb/>
with a tallow candle. We had up a lot of whisky, and <lb/>
went to playing high-low-jack for dimes, and as soon <lb/>
as the whisky begun to take hold of Bud we stopped <lb/>
drinking, but we didn't let him stop. We loaded him <lb/>
till he fell out of his chair and laid there snoring.</p>
<p>"We was ready for business now. I said we better <lb/>
pull our boots off, and his'n too, and not make any <lb/>
noise, then we could pull him and haul him around and <lb/>
ransack him without any trouble. So we done it. I <lb/>
set my boots and Bud's side by side, where they'd be <lb/>
handy. Then we stripped him and searched his seams <lb/>
and his pockets and his socks and the inside of his <lb/>
boots, and everything, and searched his bundle. Never <lb/>
<pb n="160"/>
found any di'monds. We found the screwdriver, and <lb/>
Hal says, 'What do you reckon he wanted with that?' <lb/>
I said I didn't know; but when he wasn't looking I <lb/>
hooked it. At last Hal he looked beat and discour- <lb/>
aged, and said we'd got to give it up. That was what <lb/>
I was waiting for. I says:</p>
<p>"'There's one place we hain't searched.'</p>
<p>"'What place is that?' he says.</p>
<p>"'His stomach.'</p>
<p>"'By gracious, I never thought of that! <i>Now</i> we're <lb/>
on the homestretch, to a dead moral certainty. How'll <lb/>
we manage?'</p>
<p>"'Well,' I says, 'just stay by him till I turn out and <lb/>
hunt up a drug store, and I reckon I'll fetch something <lb/>
that'll make them di'monds tired of the company <lb/>
they're keeping.'</p>
<p>"He said that's the ticket, and with him looking <lb/>
straight at me I slid myself into Bud's boots instead of <lb/>
my own, and he never noticed. They was just a shade <lb/>
large for me, but that was considerable better than be- <lb/>
ing too small. I got my bag as I went a-groping <lb/>
through the hall, and in about a minute I was out the <lb/>
back way and stretching up the river road at a five-mile <lb/>
gait.</p>
<p>"And not feeling so very bad, neither&#x2014;walking on <lb/>
di'monds don't have no such effect. When I had gone <lb/>
fifteen minutes I says to myself, there's more'n a mile <lb/>
behind me, and everything quiet. Another five minutes <lb/>
and I says there's considerable more land behind me <lb/>
now, and there's a man back there that's begun to <lb/>
<pb n="161"/>
wonder what's the trouble. Another five and I says to <lb/>
myself he's getting real uneasy&#x2014;he's walking the floor <lb/>
now. Another five, and I says to myself, there's two <lb/>
mile and a half behind me, and he's <i>awful</i> uneasy&#x2014;be- <lb/>
ginning to cuss, I reckon. Pretty soon I says to my- <lb/>
self, forty minutes gone&#x2014;he <i>knows</i> there's something <lb/>
up! Fifty minutes&#x2014;the truth's a-busting on him <lb/>
now! he is reckoning I found the di'monds whilst we <lb/>
was searching, and shoved them in my pocket and never <lb/>
let on&#x2014;yes, and he's starting out to hunt for me. <lb/>
He'll hunt for new tracks in the dust, and they'll as <lb/>
likely send him down the river as up.</p>
<p>"Just then I see a man coming down on a mule, and <lb/>
before I thought I jumped into the bush. It was <lb/>
stupid! When he got abreast he stopped and waited <lb/>
a little for me to come out; then he rode on again. <lb/>
But I didn't feel gay any more. I says to myself I've <lb/>
botched my chances by that; I surely have, if he meets <lb/>
up with Hal Clayton.</p>
<p>"Well, about three in the morning I fetched Elex- <lb/>
andria and see this stern-wheeler laying there, and was <lb/>
very glad, because I felt perfectly safe, now, you know. <lb/>
It was just daybreak. I went aboard and got this state- <lb/>
room and put on these clothes and went up in the pilot- <lb/>
house&#x2014;to watch, though I didn't reckon there was <lb/>
any need of it. I set there and played with my <lb/>
di'monds and waited and waited for the boat to start, <lb/>
but she didn't. You see, they was mending her <lb/>
machinery, but I didn't know anything about it, not <lb/>
being very much used to steamboats.</p>
<pb n="162"/>
<p>"Well, to cut the tale short, we never left there till <lb/>
plumb noon; and long before that I was hid in this <lb/>
stateroom; for before breakfast I see a man coming, <lb/>
away off, that had a gait like Hal Clayton's, and it <lb/>
made me just sick. I says to myself, if he finds out <lb/>
I'm aboard this boat, he's got me like a rat in a trap. <lb/>
All he's got to do is to have me watched, and wait&#x2014; <lb/>
wait till I slip ashore, thinking he is a thousand miles <lb/>
away, then slip after me and dog me to a good place <lb/>
and make me give up the di'monds, and then he'll&#x2014; <lb/>
oh, <i>I</i> know what he'll do! Ain't it awful&#x2014;awful! <lb/>
And now to think the <i>other</i> one's aboard, too! Oh, <lb/>
ain't it hard luck, boys&#x2014;ain't it hard! But you'll help <lb/>
save me, <i>won't</i> you?&#x2014;oh, boys, be good to a poor <lb/>
devil that's being hunted to death, and save me&#x2014;I'll <lb/>
worship the very ground you walk on!"</p>
<p>We turned in and soothed him down and told him <lb/>
we would plan for him and help him, and he needn't <lb/>
be so afeard; and so by and by he got to feeling kind <lb/>
of comfortable again, and unscrewed his heelplates and <lb/>
held up his di'monds this way and that, admiring them <lb/>
and loving them; and when the light struck into them <lb/>
they <i>was</i> beautiful, sure; why, they seemed to kind of <lb/>
bust, and snap fire out all around. But all the same I <lb/>
judged he was a fool. If I had been him I would a <lb/>
handed the di'monds to them pals and got them to go <lb/>
ashore and leave me alone. But he was made differ- <lb/>
ent. He said it was a whole fortune and he couldn't <lb/>
bear the idea.</p>
<p>Twice we stopped to fix the machinery and laid a <lb/>
<pb n="163"/>
good while, once in the night; but it wasn't dark <lb/>
enough, and he was afeard to skip. But the third <lb/>
time we had to fix it there was a better chance. We <lb/>
laid up at a country woodyard about forty mile above <lb/>
Uncle Silas's place a little after one at night, and it was <lb/>
thickening up and going to storm. So Jake he laid for <lb/>
a chance to slide. We begun to take in wood. Pretty <lb/>
soon the rain come a-drenching down, and the wind <lb/>
blowed hard. Of course every boat-hand fixed a <lb/>
gunny sack and put it on like a bonnet, the way they <lb/>
do when they are toting wood, and we got one for <lb/>
Jake, and he slipped down aft with his hand-bag and <lb/>
come tramping forrard just like the rest, and walked <lb/>
ashore with them, and when we see him pass out of the <lb/>
light of the torch-basket and get swallowed up in the <lb/>
dark, we got our breath again and just felt grateful and <lb/>
splendid. But it wasn't for long. Somebody told, I <lb/>
reckon; for in about eight or ten minutes them two <lb/>
pals come tearing forrard as tight as they could jump <lb/>
and darted ashore and was gone. We waited plumb <lb/>
till dawn for them to come back, and kept hoping they <lb/>
would, but they never did. We was awful sorry and <lb/>
low-spirited. All the hope we had was that Jake had <lb/>
got such a start that they couldn't get on his track, and <lb/>
he would get to his brother's and hide there and be <lb/>
safe.</p>
<p>He was going to take the river road, and told us to <lb/>
find out if Brace and Jubiter was to home and no <lb/>
strangers there, and then slip out about sundown and <lb/>
tell him. Said he would wait for us in a little bunch of <lb/>
<pb n="164"/>
sycamores right back of Tom's uncle Silas's tobacker <lb/>
field on the river road, a lonesome place.</p>
<p>We set and talked a long time about his chances, and <lb/>
Tom said he was all right if the pals struck up the <lb/>
river instead of down, but it wasn't likely, because <lb/>
maybe they knowed where he was from; more likely <lb/>
they would go right, and dog him all day, him not <lb/>
suspecting, and kill him when it come dark, and take <lb/>
the boots. So we was pretty sorrowful.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>a tragedy in the woods</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> didn't get done tinkering the machinery till away <lb/>
late in the afternoon, and so it was so close to <lb/>
sundown when we got home that we never stopped on <lb/>
our road, but made a break for the sycamores as tight <lb/>
as we could go, to tell Jake what the delay was, and <lb/>
have him wait till we could go to Brace's and find out <lb/>
how things was there. It was getting pretty dim by the <lb/>
time we turned the corner of the woods, sweating and <lb/>
panting with that long run, and see the sycamores thirty <lb/>
yards ahead of us; and just then we see a couple of <lb/>
men run into the bunch and heard two or three terrible <lb/>
screams for help. "Poor Jake is killed, sure," we <lb/>
says. We was scared through and through, and broke <lb/>
for the tobacker field and hid there, trembling so our <lb/>
clothes would hardly stay on; and just as we skipped <lb/>
in there, a couple of men went tearing by, and into the <lb/>
bunch they went, and in a second out jumps four men <lb/>
and took out up the road as tight as they could go, <lb/>
two chasing two.</p>
<p>We laid down, kind of weak and sick, and listened <lb/>
for more sounds, but didn't hear none for a good while <lb/>
<pb n="166"/>
but just our hearts. We was thinking of that awful <lb/>
thing laying yonder in the sycamores, and it seemed <lb/>
like being that close to a ghost, and it give me the cold <lb/>
shudders. The moon come a-swelling up out of the <lb/>
ground, now, powerful big and round and bright, be- <lb/>
hind a comb of trees, like a face looking through prison <lb/>
bars, and the black shadders and white places begun to <lb/>
creep around, and it was miserable quiet and still and <lb/>
night-breezy and graveyardy and scary. All of a sud- <lb/>
den Tom whispers:</p>
<p>"Look!&#x2014;what's that?"</p>
<p>"Don't!" I says. "Don't take a person by sur- <lb/>
prise that way. I'm 'most ready to die, anyway, with- <lb/>
out you doing that."</p>
<p>"Look, I tell you. It's something coming out of <lb/>
the sycamores."</p>
<p>"Don't, Tom!"</p>
<p>"It's terrible tall!"</p>
<p>"Oh, lordy-lordy! let's&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Keep still&#x2014;it's a-coming this way."</p>
<p>He was so excited he could hardly get breath enough <lb/>
to whisper. I had to look. I couldn't help it. So <lb/>
now we was both on our knees with our chins on a <lb/>
fence rail and gazing&#x2014;yes, and gasping, too. It was <lb/>
coming down the road&#x2014;coming in the shadder of the <lb/>
trees, and you couldn't see it good; not till it was <lb/>
pretty close to us; then it stepped into a bright splotch <lb/>
of moonlight and we sunk right down in our tracks&#x2014; <lb/>
it was Jake Dunlap's ghost! That was what we said <lb/>
to ourselves.</p>
<pb n="167"/>
<p>We couldn't stir for a minute or two; then it was <lb/>
gone. We talked about it in low voices. Tom <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"They're mostly dim and smoky, or like they're <lb/>
made out of fog, but this one wasn't."</p>
<p>"No," I says; "I seen the goggles and the whiskers <lb/>
perfectly plain."</p>
<p>"Yes, and the very colors in them loud countrified <lb/>
Sunday clothes&#x2014;plaid breeches, green and black&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Cotton-velvet westcot, fire-red and yaller squares&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Leather straps to the bottoms of the breeches legs <lb/>
and one of them hanging unbuttoned&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Yes, and that hat&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What a hat for a ghost to wear!"</p>
<p>You see it was the first season anybody wore that <lb/>
kind&#x2014;a black stiff-brim stove-pipe, very high, and <lb/>
not smooth, with a round top&#x2014;just like a sugar-loaf.</p>
<p>"Did you notice if its hair was the same, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;seems to me I did, then again it seems to me <lb/>
I didn't."</p>
<p>"I didn't either; but it had its bag along, I noticed <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>"So did I. How can there be a ghost-bag, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Sho! I wouldn't be as ignorant as that if I was <lb/>
you, Huck Finn. Whatever a ghost has, turns to ghost- <lb/>
stuff. They've got to have their things, like anybody <lb/>
else. You see, yourself, that its clothes was turned to <lb/>
ghost-stuff. Well, then, what's to hender its bag from <lb/>
turning, too? Of course it done it."</p>
<p>That was reasonable. I couldn't find no fault with <lb/>
<pb n="168"/>
it. Bill Withers and his brother Jack come along by, <lb/>
talking, and Jack says:</p>
<p>"What do you reckon he was toting?"</p>
<p>"I dunno; but it was pretty heavy."</p>
<p>"Yes, all he could lug. Nigger stealing corn from <lb/>
old Parson Silas, I judged."</p>
<p>"So did I. And so I allowed I wouldn't let on to <lb/>
see him."</p>
<p>"That's me, too."</p>
<p>Then they both laughed, and went on out of hearing. <lb/>
It showed how unpopular old Uncle Silas had got to be <lb/>
now. They wouldn't 'a' let a nigger steal anybody <lb/>
else's corn and never done anything to him.</p>
<p>We heard some more voices mumbling along towards <lb/>
us and getting louder, and sometimes a cackle of a <lb/>
laugh. It was Lem Beebe and Jim Lane. Jim Lane <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"Who?&#x2014;Jubiter Dunlap?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. I reckon so. I seen him spad- <lb/>
ing up some ground along about an hour ago, just be- <lb/>
fore sundown&#x2014;him and the parson. Said he guessed <lb/>
he wouldn't go to-night, but we could have his dog if <lb/>
we wanted him."</p>
<p>"Too tired, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;works so hard!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you bet!"</p>
<p>They cackled at that, and went on by. Tom said we <lb/>
better jump out and tag along after them, because they <lb/>
was going our way and it wouldn't be comfortable to <lb/>
<pb n="169"/>
run across the ghost all by ourselves. So we done it, <lb/>
and got home all right.</p>
<p>That night was the second of September&#x2014;a Satur- <lb/>
day. I sha'n't ever forget it. You'll see why, pretty <lb/>
soon.</p>

<p><smcap>We</smcap> tramped along behind Jim and Lem till we come <lb/>
to the back stile where old Jim's cabin was that <lb/>
he was captivated in, the time we set him free, and here <lb/>
come the dogs piling around us to say howdy, and <lb/>
there was the lights of the house, too; so we warn't <lb/>
afeard any more, and was going to climb over, but <lb/>
Tom says:</p>
<p>"Hold on; set down here a minute. By George!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" says I.</p>
<p>"Matter enough!" he says. "Wasn't you expect- <lb/>
ing we would be the first to tell the family who it is <lb/>
that's been killed yonder in the sycamores, and all <lb/>
about them rapscallions that done it, and about the <lb/>
di'monds they've smouched off of the corpse, and paint <lb/>
it up fine, and have the glory of being the ones that <lb/>
knows a lot more about it than anybody else?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course. It wouldn't be you, Tom Sawyer, <lb/>
if you was to let such a chance go by. I reckon it <lb/>
ain't going to suffer none for lack of paint," I says, <lb/>
"when you start in to scollop the facts."</p>
<p>"Well, now," he says, perfectly ca'm, "what would <lb/>
<pb n="171"/>
you say if I was to tell you I ain't going to start in at <lb/>
all?"</p>
<p>I was astonished to hear him talk so. I says:</p>
<p>"I'd say it's a lie. You ain't in earnest, Tom <lb/>
Sawyer?"</p>
<p>"You'll soon see. Was the ghost barefooted?"</p>
<p>"No, it wasn't. What of it?"</p>
<p>"You wait&#x2014;I'll show you what. Did it have its <lb/>
boots on?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I seen them plain."</p>
<p>"Swear it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I swear it."</p>
<p>"So do I. Now do you know what that means?"</p>
<p>"No. What does it mean?"</p>
<p>"Means that them thieves <i>didn't get the di'monds</i>."</p>
<p>"Jimminy! What makes you think that?"</p>
<p>"I don't only think it, I know it. Didn't the <lb/>
breeches and goggles and whiskers and hand-bag and <lb/>
every blessed thing turn to ghost-stuff? Everything it <lb/>
had on turned, didn't it? It shows that the reason its <lb/>
boots turned too was because it still had them on after <lb/>
it started to go ha'nting around, and if that ain't proof <lb/>
that them blatherskites didn't get the boots, I'd like to <lb/>
know what you'd <i>call</i> proof."</p>
<p>Think of that now. I never see such a head as that <lb/>
boy had. Why, <i>I</i> had eyes and I could see things, but <lb/>
they never meant nothing to me. But Tom Sawyer <lb/>
was different. When Tom Sawyer seen a thing it just <lb/>
got up on its hind legs and <i>talked</i> to him&#x2014;told him <lb/>
everything it knowed. <i>I</i> never see such a head.</p>
<pb n="172"/>
<p>"Tom Sawyer," I says, "I'll say it again as I've <lb/>
said it a many a time before: I ain't fitten to black <lb/>
your boots. But that's all right&#x2014;that's neither here <lb/>
nor there. God Almighty made us all, and some He <lb/>
gives eyes that's blind, and some He gives eyes that <lb/>
can see, and I reckon it ain't none of our lookout what <lb/>
He done it for; it's all right, or He'd 'a' fixed it some <lb/>
other way. Go on&#x2014;I see plenty plain enough, now, <lb/>
that them thieves didn't get way with the di'monds. <lb/>
Why didn't they, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>"Because they got chased away by them other two <lb/>
men before they could pull the boots off of the corpse."</p>
<p>"That's so! I see it now. But looky here, Tom, <lb/>
why ain't we to go and tell about it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, can't you see? Look at <lb/>
it. What's a-going to happen? There's going to be <lb/>
an inquest in the morning. Them two men will tell <lb/>
how they heard the yells and rushed there just in time <lb/>
to not save the stranger. Then the jury 'll twaddle <lb/>
and twaddle and twaddle, and finally they'll fetch in a <lb/>
verdict that he got shot or stuck or busted over the <lb/>
head with something, and come to his death by the in- <lb/>
spiration of God. And after they've buried him they'll <lb/>
auction off his things for to pay the expenses, and <lb/>
then's <i>our</i> chance."</p>
<p>"How, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Buy the boots for two dollars!"</p>
<p>Well, it 'most took my breath.</p>
<p>"My land! Why, Tom, <i>we'll</i> get the di'monds!"</p>
<p>"You bet. Some day there'll be a big reward <lb/>
<pb n="173"/>
offered for them&#x2014;a thousand dollars, sure. That's <lb/>
our money! Now we'll trot in and see the folks. <lb/>
And mind you we don't know anything about any <lb/>
murder, or any di'monds, or any thieves&#x2014;don't you <lb/>
forget that."</p>
<p>I had to sigh a little over the way he had got it fixed. <lb/>
<i>I</i>'d 'a' <i>sold</i> them di'monds&#x2014;yes, sir&#x2014;for twelve <lb/>
thousand dollars; but I didn't say anything. It <lb/>
wouldn't done any good. I says:</p>
<p>"But what are we going to tell your aunt Sally has <lb/>
made us so long getting down here from the village, <lb/>
Tom?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll leave that to you," he says. "I reckon <lb/>
you can explain it somehow."</p>
<p>He was always just that strict and delicate. He <lb/>
never would tell a lie himself.</p>
<p>We struck across the big yard, noticing this, that, <lb/>
and t'other thing that was so familiar, and we so glad <lb/>
to see it again, and when we got to the roofed big <lb/>
passageway betwixt the double log house and the <lb/>
kitchen part, there was everything hanging on the wall <lb/>
just as it used to was, even to Uncle Silas's old faded <lb/>
green baize working-gown with the hood to it, and rag- <lb/>
gedy white patch between the shoulders that always <lb/>
looked like somebody had hit him with a snowball; and <lb/>
then we lifted the latch and walked in. Aunt Sally she <lb/>
was just a-ripping and a-tearing around, and the <lb/>
children was huddled in one corner, and the old man <lb/>
he was huddled in the other and praying for help in <lb/>
time of need. She jumped for us with joy and tears <lb/>
<pb n="174"/>
running down her face and give us a whacking box on <lb/>
the ear, and then hugged us and kissed us and boxed <lb/>
us again, and just couldn't seem to get enough of it, <lb/>
she was so glad to see us; and she says:</p>
<p>"Where <i>have</i> you been a-loafing to, you good-for- <lb/>
nothing trash! I've been that worried about you I <lb/>
didn't know what to do. Your traps has been here <lb/>
<i>ever</i> so long, and I've had supper cooked fresh about <lb/>
four times so as to have it hot and good when you <lb/>
come, till at last my patience is just plumb wore out, <lb/>
and I declare I&#x2014;I&#x2014;why I could skin you alive! You <lb/>
must be starving, poor things!&#x2014;set down, set down, <lb/>
everybody; don't lose no more time."</p>
<p>It was good to be there again behind all that noble <lb/>
corn-pone and spareribs, and everything that you could <lb/>
ever want in this world. Old Uncle Silas he peeled off <lb/>
one of his bulliest old-time blessings, with as many <lb/>
layers to it as an onion, and whilst the angels was haul- <lb/>
ing in the slack of it I was trying to study up what to <lb/>
say about what kept us so long. When our plates was <lb/>
all loadened and we'd got a-going, she asked me, and <lb/>
I says:</p>
<p>"Well, you see,&#x2014;er&#x2014;Mizzes&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Huck Finn! Since when am I Mizzes to you? <lb/>
Have I ever been stingy of cuffs or kisses for you since <lb/>
the day you stood in this room and I took you for Tom <lb/>
Sawyer and blessed God for sending you to me, though <lb/>
you told me four thousand lies and I believed every <lb/>
one of them like a simpleton? Call me Aunt Sally&#x2014; <lb/>
like you always done."</p>
<pb n="175"/>
<p>So I done it. And I says:</p>
<p>"Well, me and Tom allowed we would come along <lb/>
afoot and take a smell of the woods, and we run across <lb/>
Lem Beebe and Jim Lane, and they asked us to go with <lb/>
them blackberrying to-night, and said they could bor- <lb/>
row Jubiter Dunlap's dog, because he had told them <lb/>
just that minute&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Where did they see him?" says the old man; and <lb/>
when I looked up to see how <i>he</i> come to take an intrust <lb/>
in a little thing like that, his eyes was just burning into <lb/>
me, he was that eager. It surprised me so it kind of <lb/>
throwed me off, but I pulled myself together again and <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"It was when he was spading up some ground along <lb/>
with you, towards sundown or along there."</p>
<p>He only said, "Um," in a kind of a disappointed <lb/>
way, and didn't take no more intrust. So I went on. <lb/>
I says:</p>
<p>"Well, then, as I was a-saying&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That'll do, you needn't go no furder." It was <lb/>
Aunt Sally. She was boring right into me with her <lb/>
eyes, and very indignant. "Huck Finn," she says, <lb/>
"how'd them men come to talk about going a-black- <lb/>
berrying in September&#x2014;in <i>this</i> region?"</p>
<p>I see I had slipped up, and I couldn't say a word. <lb/>
She waited, still a-gazing at me, then she says:</p>
<p>"And how'd they come to strike that idiot idea of <lb/>
going a-blackberrying in the night?"</p>
<p>"Well, m'm, they&#x2014;er&#x2014;they told us they had a <lb/>
lantern, and&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="176"/>
<p>"Oh, <i>shet</i> up&#x2014;do! Looky here; what was they <lb/>
going to do with a dog?&#x2014;hunt blackberries with it?"</p>
<p>"I think, m'm, they&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Now, Tom Sawyer, what kind of a lie are you fix- <lb/>
ing <i>your</i> mouth to contribit to this mess of rubbage? <lb/>
Speak out&#x2014;and I warn you before you begin, that <lb/>
I don't believe a word of it. You and Huck's been up <lb/>
to something you no business to&#x2014;<i>I</i> know it perfectly <lb/>
well; <i>I</i> know you, <i>both</i> of you. Now you explain that <lb/>
dog, and them blackberries, and the lantern, and the <lb/>
rest of that rot&#x2014;and mind you talk as straight as a <lb/>
string&#x2014;do you hear?"</p>
<p>Tom he looked considerable hurt, and says, very <lb/>
dignified:</p>
<p>"It is a pity if Huck is to be talked to that way, just <lb/>
for making a little bit of a mistake that anybody could <lb/>
make."</p>
<p>"What mistake has he made?"</p>
<p>"Why, only the mistake of saying blackberries when <lb/>
of course he meant strawberries."</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer, I lay if you aggravate me a little <lb/>
more, I'll&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Aunt Sally, without knowing it&#x2014;and of course <lb/>
without intending it&#x2014;you are in the wrong. If you'd <lb/>
'a' studied natural history the way you ought, you <lb/>
would know that all over the world except just here in <lb/>
Arkansaw they <i>always</i> hunt strawberries with a dog&#x2014; <lb/>
and a lantern&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But she busted in on him there and just piled into <lb/>
him and snowed him under. She was so mad she <lb/>
<pb n="177"/>
couldn't get the words out fast enough, and she gushed <lb/>
them out in one everlasting freshet. That was what <lb/>
Tom Sawyer was after. He allowed to work her up <lb/>
and get her started and then leave her alone and let her <lb/>
burn herself out. Then she would be so aggravated <lb/>
with that subject that she wouldn't say another word <lb/>
about it, nor let anybody else. Well, it happened just <lb/>
so. When she was tuckered out and had to hold up, <lb/>
he says, quite ca'm:</p>
<p>"And yet, all the same, Aunt Sally&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Shet up!" she says, "I don't want to hear <lb/>
another word out of you."</p>
<p>So we was perfectly safe, then, and didn't have no <lb/>
more trouble about that delay. Tom done it elegant.</p>

<head><smcap>a night's vigil</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Benny</smcap> she was looking pretty sober, and she sighed <lb/>
some, now and then; but pretty soon she got to <lb/>
asking about Mary, and Sid, and Tom's aunt Polly, <lb/>
and then Aunt Sally's clouds cleared off and she got in <lb/>
a good humor and joined in on the questions and was <lb/>
her lovingest best self, and so the rest of the supper <lb/>
went along gay and pleasant. But the old man he <lb/>
didn't take any hand hardly, and was absent-minded <lb/>
and restless, and done a considerable amount of sigh- <lb/>
ing; and it was kind of heart-breaking to see him so <lb/>
sad and troubled and worried.</p>
<p>By and by, a spell after supper, come a nigger and <lb/>
knocked on the door and put his head in with his old <lb/>

brother, and was getting tired waiting supper for him, <lb/>
and would Marse Silas please tell him where he was? <lb/>
I never see Uncle Silas speak up so sharp and fractious <lb/>
before. He says:</p>
<p>"Am <i>I</i> his brother's keeper?" And then he kind <lb/>

and I ain't very well these days, and not hardly respon- <lb/>
sible. Tell him he ain't here."</p>
<p>And when the nigger was gone he got up and <lb/>
walked the floor, backwards and forwards, mumbling <lb/>
and muttering to himself and plowing his hands through <lb/>
his hair. It was real pitiful to see him. Aunt Sally she <lb/>
whispered to us and told us not to take notice of him, <lb/>
it embarrassed him. She said he was always thinking <lb/>
and thinking, since these troubles come on, and she <lb/>
allowed he didn't more'n about half know what he was <lb/>
about when the thinking spells was on him; and she <lb/>
said he walked in his sleep considerable more now than <lb/>
he used to, and sometimes wandered around over the <lb/>
house and even outdoors in his sleep, and if we catched <lb/>
him at it we must let him alone and not disturb him. <lb/>
She said she reckoned it didn't do him no harm, and <lb/>
may be it done him good. She said Benny was the <lb/>
only one that was much help to him these days. Said <lb/>
Benny appeared to know just when to try to soothe <lb/>
him and when to leave him alone.</p>
<p>So he kept on tramping up and down the floor and <lb/>
muttering, till by and by he begun to look pretty tired; <lb/>
then Benny she went and snuggled up to his side and <lb/>
put one hand in his and one arm around his waist and <lb/>
walked with him; and he smiled down on her, and <lb/>
reached down and kissed her; and so, little by little <lb/>
the trouble went out of his face and she persuaded him <lb/>
off to his room. They had very petting ways together, <lb/>
and it was uncommon pretty to see.</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>Aunt Sally she was busy getting the children ready <lb/>
for bed; so by and by it got dull and tedious, and me <lb/>
and Tom took a turn in the moonlight, and fetched up <lb/>
in the watermelon-patch and et one, and had a good <lb/>
deal of talk. And Tom said he'd bet the quarreling <lb/>
was all Jubiter's fault, and he was going to be on hand <lb/>
the first time he got a chance, and see; and if it was <lb/>
so, he was going to do his level best to get Uncle Silas <lb/>
to turn him off.</p>
<p>And so we talked and smoked and stuffed water- <lb/>
melons much as two hours, and then it was pretty late, <lb/>
and when we got back the house was quiet and dark, <lb/>
and everybody gone to bed.</p>
<p>Tom he always seen everything, and now he see that <lb/>
the old green baize work-gown was gone, and said it <lb/>
wasn't gone when he went out; so he allowed it was <lb/>
curious, and then we went up to bed.</p>
<p>We could hear Benny stirring around in her room, <lb/>
which was next to ourn, and judged she was worried a <lb/>
good deal about her father and couldn't sleep. We <lb/>
found we couldn't, neither. So we set up a long time, <lb/>
and smoked and talked in a low voice, and felt pretty <lb/>
dull and down-hearted. We talked the murder and the <lb/>
ghost over and over again, and got so creepy and <lb/>
crawly we couldn't get sleepy nohow and noway.</p>
<p>By and by, when it was away late in the night and all <lb/>
the sounds was late sounds and solemn, Tom nudged <lb/>
me and whispers to me to look, and I done it, and there <lb/>
we see a man poking around in the yard like he didn't <lb/>
know just what he wanted to do, but it was pretty dim <lb/>
<pb n="181"/>
and we couldn't see him good. Then he started for <lb/>
the stile, and as he went over it the moon came out <lb/>
strong, and he had a long-handled shovel over his <lb/>
shoulder, and we see the white patch on the old work- <lb/>
gown. So Tom says:</p>
<p>"He's a-walking in his sleep. I wish we was <lb/>
allowed to follow him and see where he's going to. <lb/>
There, he's turned down by the tobacker-field. Out <lb/>
of sight now. It's a dreadful pity he can't rest no <lb/>
better."</p>
<p>We waited a long time, but he didn't come back any <lb/>
more, or if he did he come around the other way; so <lb/>
at last we was tuckered out and went to sleep and had <lb/>
nightmares, a million of them. But before dawn we <lb/>
was awake again, because meantime a storm had come <lb/>
up and been raging, and the thunder and lightning <lb/>
was awful, and the wind was a-thrashing the trees <lb/>
around, and the rain was driving down in slanting <lb/>
sheets, and the gullies was running rivers. Tom says:</p>
<p>"Looky here, Huck, I'll tell you one thing that's <lb/>
mighty curious. Up to the time we went out last night <lb/>
the family hadn't heard about Jake Dunlap being mur- <lb/>
dered. Now the men that chased Hal Clayton and <lb/>
Bud Dixon away would spread the thing around in a <lb/>
half an hour, and every neighbor that heard it would <lb/>
shin out and fly around from one farm to t'other and <lb/>
try to be the first to tell the news. Land, they don't <lb/>
have such a big thing as that to tell twice in thirty year! <lb/>
Huck, it's mighty strange; I don't understand it."</p>
<p>So then he was in a fidget for the rain to let up, so <lb/>
<pb n="182"/>
we could turn out and run across some of the people <lb/>
and see if they would say anything about it to us. <lb/>
And he said if they did we must be horribly surprised <lb/>
and shocked.</p>
<p>We was out and gone the minute the rain stopped. <lb/>
It was just broad day then. We loafed along up the <lb/>
road, and now and then met a person and stopped and <lb/>
said howdy, and told them when we come, and how we <lb/>
left the folks at home, and how long we was going to <lb/>
stay, and all that, but none of them said a word about <lb/>
that thing; which was just astonishing, and no mistake. <lb/>
Tom said he believed if we went to the sycamores we <lb/>
would find that body laying there solitary and alone, <lb/>
and not a soul around. Said he believed the men <lb/>
chased the thieves so far into the woods that the thieves <lb/>
prob'ly seen a good chance and turned on them at last, <lb/>
and maybe they all killed each other, and so there <lb/>
wasn't anybody left to tell.</p>
<p>First we knowed, gabbling along that away, we was <lb/>
right at the sycamores. The cold chills trickled down <lb/>
my back and I wouldn't budge another step, for all <lb/>
Tom's persuading. But he couldn't hold in; he'd <i>got</i> <lb/>
to see if the boots was safe on that body yet. So he <lb/>
crope in&#x2014;and the next minute out he come again with <lb/>
his eyes bulging he was so excited, and says:</p>
<p>"Huck, it's gone!"</p>
<p>I <i>was</i> astonished! I says:</p>
<p>"Tom, you don't mean it."</p>
<p>"It's gone, sure. There ain't a sign of it. The <lb/>
ground is trampled some, but if there was any blood <lb/>
<pb n="183"/>
it's all washed away by the storm, for it's all puddles <lb/>
and slush in there."</p>
<p>At last I give in, and went and took a look myself; <lb/>
and it was just as Tom said&#x2014;there wasn't a sign of a <lb/>
corpse.</p>
<p>"Dern it," I says, "the di'monds is gone. Don't <lb/>
you reckon the thieves slunk back and lugged him off, <lb/>
Tom?"</p>
<p>"Looks like it. It just does. Now where'd they <lb/>
hide him, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," I says, disgusted, "and what's <lb/>
more I don't care. They've got the boots, and that's <lb/>
all <i>I</i> cared about. He'll lay around these woods a <lb/>
long time before <i>I</i> hunt him up."</p>
<p>Tom didn't feel no more intrust in him neither, only <lb/>
curiosity to know what come of him; but he said we'd <lb/>
lay low and keep dark and it wouldn't be long till the <lb/>
dogs or somebody rousted him out.</p>
<p>We went back home to breakfast ever so bothered <lb/>
and put out and disappointed and swindled. I warn't <lb/>
ever so down on a corpse before.</p>

<head><smcap>talking with the ghost</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> warn't very cheerful at breakfast. Aunt Sally she <lb/>
looked old and tired and let the children snarl and <lb/>
fuss at one another and didn't seem to notice it was <lb/>
going on, which wasn't her usual style; me and Tom <lb/>
had a plenty to think about without talking; Benny she <lb/>
looked like she hadn't had much sleep, and whenever <lb/>
she'd lift her head a little and steal a look towards her <lb/>
father you could see there was tears in her eyes; and <lb/>
as for the old man, his things stayed on his plate and <lb/>
got cold without him knowing they was there, I reckon, <lb/>
for he was thinking and thinking all the time, and never <lb/>
said a word and never et a bite.</p>
<p>By and by when it was stillest, that nigger's head <lb/>
was poked in at the door again, and he said his Marse <lb/>
Brace was getting powerful uneasy about Marse Jubiter, <lb/>
which hadn't come home yet, and would Marse Silas <lb/>
please&#x2014;</p>
<p>He was looking at Uncle Silas, and he stopped there, <lb/>
like the rest of his words was froze; for Uncle Silas he <lb/>
rose up shaky and steadied himself leaning his fingers <lb/>
on the table, and he was panting, and his eyes was set <lb/>
on the nigger, and he kept swallowing, and put his <lb/>
<pb n="185"/>
other hand up to his throat a couple of times, and at <lb/>
last he got his words started, and says:</p>
<p>"Does he&#x2014;does he&#x2014;think&#x2014;<i>what</i> does he think! <lb/>
Tell him&#x2014;tell him&#x2014;" Then he sunk down in his <lb/>
chair limp and weak, and says, so as you could hardly <lb/>
hear him: "Go away&#x2014;go away!"</p>
<p>The nigger looked scared and cleared out, and we <lb/>
all felt&#x2014;well, I don't know how we felt, but it was <lb/>
awful, with the old man panting there, and his eyes set <lb/>
and looking like a person that was dying. None of us <lb/>
could budge; but Benny she slid around soft, with her <lb/>
tears running down, and stood by his side, and nestled <lb/>
his old gray head up against her and begun to stroke it <lb/>
and pet it with her hands, and nodded to us to go <lb/>
away, and we done it, going out very quiet, like the <lb/>
dead was there.</p>
<p>Me and Tom struck out for the woods mighty <lb/>
solemn, and saying how different it was now to what it <lb/>
was last summer when we was here and everything was <lb/>
so peaceful and happy and everybody thought so much <lb/>
of Uncle Silas, and he was so cheerful and simple- <lb/>
hearted and pudd'n-headed and good&#x2014;and now look <lb/>
at him. If he hadn't lost his mind he wasn't much <lb/>
short of it. That was what we allowed.</p>
<p>It was a most lovely day now, and bright and sun- <lb/>
shiny; and the further and further we went over the <lb/>
hills towards the prairie the lovelier and lovelier the <lb/>
trees and flowers got to be and the more it seemed <lb/>
strange and somehow wrong that there had to be <lb/>
trouble in such a world as this. And then all of a <lb/>
<pb n="186"/>
sudden I catched my breath and grabbed Tom's arm, and <lb/>
all my livers and lungs and things fell down into my legs.</p>
<p>"There it is!" I says. We jumped back behind a <lb/>
bush shivering, and Tom says:</p>
<p>"'Sh!&#x2014;don't make a noise."</p>
<p>It was setting on a log right in the edge of a little <lb/>
prairie, thinking. I tried to get Tom to come away, <lb/>
but he wouldn't, and I dasn't budge by myself. He <lb/>
said we mightn't ever get another chance to see one, <lb/>
and he was going to look his fill at this one if he died <lb/>
for it. So I looked too, though it give me the fan- <lb/>
tods to do it. Tom he <i>had</i> to talk, but he talked low. <lb/>
He says:</p>
<p>"Poor Jakey, it's got all its things on, just as he <lb/>
said he would. <i>Now</i> you see what we wasn't certain <lb/>
about&#x2014;its hair. It's not long now the way it was: <lb/>
it's got it cropped close to its head, the way he said he <lb/>
would. Huck, I never see anything look any more <lb/>
naturaler than what It does."</p>
<p>"Nor I neither," I says; "I'd recognize it any- <lb/>
wheres."</p>
<p>"So would I. It looks perfectly solid and genu- <lb/>
wyne, just the way it done before it died."</p>
<p>So we kept a-gazing. Pretty soon Tom says:</p>
<p>"Huck, there's something mighty curious about this <lb/>
one, don't you know? <i>It</i> oughtn't to be going around <lb/>
in the daytime."</p>
<p>"That's so, Tom&#x2014;I never heard the like of it <lb/>
before."</p>
<p>"No, sir, they don't ever come out only at night&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="187"/>
and then not till after twelve. There's something <lb/>
wrong about this one, now you mark my words. I <lb/>
don't believe it's got any right to be around in the <lb/>
daytime. But don't it look natural! Jake was going <lb/>
to play deef and dumb here, so the neighbors wouldn't <lb/>
know his voice. Do you reckon it would do that if we <lb/>
was to holler at it?"</p>
<p>"Lordy, Tom, don't talk so! If you was to holler <lb/>
at it I'd die in my tracks."</p>
<p>"Don't you worry, I ain't going to holler at it. <lb/>
Look, Huck, it's a-scratching its head&#x2014;don't you see?"</p>
<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>
<p>"Why, this. What's the sense of it scratching its <lb/>
head? There ain't anything there to itch; its head is <lb/>
made out of fog or something like that, and <i>can't</i> itch. <lb/>
A fog can't itch; any fool knows that."</p>
<p>"Well, then, if it don't itch and can't itch, what in <lb/>
the nation is it scratching it for? Ain't it just habit, <lb/>
don't you reckon?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, I don't. I ain't a bit satisfied about the <lb/>
way this one acts. I've a blame good notion it's a <lb/>
bogus one&#x2014;I have, as sure as I'm a-sitting here. <lb/>
Because, if it&#x2014;Huck!"</p>
<p>"Well, what's the matter now?"</p>
<p>"<i>You can't see the bushes through it!</i>"</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, it's so, sure! It's as solid as a cow. <lb/>
I sort of begin to think&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Huck, it's biting off a chaw of tobacker! By <lb/>
George, <i>they</i> don't chaw&#x2014;they hain't got anything to <lb/>
chaw <i>with</i>. Huck!"</p>
<pb n="188"/>
<p>"I'm a-listening."</p>
<p>"It ain't a ghost at all. It's Jake Dunlap his own <lb/>
self!"</p>
<p>"Oh your granny!" I says.</p>
<p>"Huck Finn, did we find any corpse in the syca- <lb/>
mores?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Or any sign of one?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Mighty good reason. Hadn't ever been any corpse <lb/>
there."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, you know we heard&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Yes, we did&#x2014;heard a howl or two. Does that <lb/>
prove anybody was killed? Course it don't. And we <lb/>
seen four men run, then this one come walking out and <lb/>
we took it for a ghost. No more ghost than you are. <lb/>
It was Jake Dunlap his own self, and it's Jake Dunlap <lb/>
now. He's been and got his hair cropped, the way he <lb/>
said he would, and he's playing himself for a stranger, <lb/>
just the same as he said he would. Ghost? Hum!&#x2014; <lb/>
he's as sound as a nut."</p>
<p>Then I see it all, and how we had took too much for <lb/>
granted. I was powerful glad he didn't get killed, and <lb/>
so was Tom, and we wondered which he would like the <lb/>
best&#x2014;for us to never let on to know him, or how? <lb/>
Tom reckoned the best way would be to go and ask <lb/>
him. So he started; but I kept a little behind, because <lb/>
I didn't know but it might be a ghost, after all. When <lb/>
Tom got to where he was, he says:</p>
<p>"Me and Huck's mighty glad to see you again, <lb/>
<pb n="189"/>
and you needn't be afeared we'll tell. And if you <lb/>
think it'll be safer for you if we don't let on to know <lb/>
you when we run across you, say the word and you'll <lb/>
see you can depend on us, and would ruther cut our <lb/>
hands off than get you into the least little bit of <lb/>
danger."</p>
<p>First off he looked surprised to see us, and not very <lb/>
glad, either; but as Tom went on he looked pleasanter, <lb/>
and when he was done he smiled, and nodded his head <lb/>
several times, and made signs with his hands, and says:</p>
<p>"Goo-goo&#x2014;goo-goo," the way deef and dummies <lb/>
does.</p>
<p>Just then we see some of Steve Nickerson's people <lb/>
coming that lived t'other side of the prairie, so Tom <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"You do it elegant; I never see anybody do it <lb/>
better. You're right; play it on us, too; play it on <lb/>
us same as the others; it'll keep you in practice and <lb/>
prevent you making blunders. We'll keep away from <lb/>
you and let on we don't know you, but any time we <lb/>
can be any help, you just let us know."</p>
<p>Then we loafed along past the Nickersons, and of <lb/>
course they asked if that was the new stranger yonder, <lb/>
and where'd he come from, and what was his name, <lb/>
and which communion was he, Babtis' or Methodis', <lb/>
and which politics, Whig or Democrat, and how long <lb/>
is he staying, and all them other questions that humans <lb/>
always asks when a stranger comes, and animals does, <lb/>
too. But Tom said he warn't able to make anything <lb/>
out of deef and dumb signs, and the same with goo- <lb/>
<pb n="190"/>
gooing. Then we watched them go and bullyrag Jake; <lb/>
because we was pretty uneasy for him. Tom said it <lb/>
would take him days to get so he wouldn't forget he <lb/>
was a deef and dummy sometimes, and speak out be- <lb/>
fore he thought. When we had watched long enough <lb/>
to see that Jake was getting along all right and working <lb/>
his signs very good, we loafed along again, allowing to <lb/>
strike the schoolhouse about recess time, which was a <lb/>
three-mile tramp.</p>
<p>I was so disappointed not to hear Jake tell about the <lb/>
row in the sycamores, and how near he come to get- <lb/>
ting killed, that I couldn't seem to get over it, and <lb/>
Tom he felt the same, but said if we was in Jake's fix <lb/>
we would want to go careful and keep still and not take <lb/>
any chances.</p>
<p>The boys and girls was all glad to see us again, and <lb/>
we had a real good time all through recess. Coming <lb/>
to school the Henderson boys had come across the new <lb/>
deef and dummy and told the rest; so all the scholars <lb/>
was chuck full of him and couldn't talk about anything <lb/>
else, and was in a sweat to get a sight of him because <lb/>
they hadn't ever seen a deef and dummy in their lives, <lb/>
and it made a powerful excitement.</p>
<p>Tom said it was tough to have to keep mum now; <lb/>
said we would be heroes if we could come out and tell <lb/>
all we knowed; but after all, it was still more heroic to <lb/>
keep mum, there warn't two boys in a million could do <lb/>
it. That was Tom Sawyer's idea about it, and I <lb/>
reckoned there warn't anybody could better it.</p>

<head><smcap>finding of jubiter dunlap</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> the next two or three days Dummy he got to be <lb/>
powerful popular. He went associating around with <lb/>
the neighbors, and they made much of him, and was <lb/>
proud to have such a rattling curiosity among them. <lb/>
They had him to breakfast, they had him to dinner, <lb/>
they had him to supper; they kept him loaded up <lb/>
with hog and hominy, and warn't ever tired staring at <lb/>
him and wondering over him, and wishing they knowed <lb/>
more about him, he was so uncommon and romantic. <lb/>
His signs warn't no good; people couldn't under- <lb/>
stand them and he prob'ly couldn't himself, but he <lb/>
done a sight of goo-gooing, and so everybody was sat- <lb/>
isfied, and admired to hear him go it. He toted a <lb/>
piece of slate around, and a pencil; and people wrote <lb/>
questions on it and he wrote answers; but there warn't <lb/>
anybody could read his writing but Brace Dunlap. <lb/>
Brace said he couldn't read it very good, but he could <lb/>
manage to dig out the meaning most of the time. He <lb/>
said Dummy said he belonged away off somers and <lb/>
used to be well off, but got busted by swindlers which <lb/>
he had trusted, and was poor now, and hadn't any way <lb/>
to make a living.</p>
<pb n="192"/>
<p>Everybody praised Brace Dunlap for being so good <lb/>
to that stranger. He let him have a little log-cabin all <lb/>
to himself, and had his niggers take care of it, and fetch <lb/>
him all the vittles he wanted.</p>
<p>Dummy was at our house some, because old Uncle <lb/>
Silas was so afflicted himself, these days, that anybody <lb/>
else that was afflicted was a comfort to him. Me and <lb/>
Tom didn't let on that we had knowed him before, and <lb/>
he didn't let on that he had knowed us before. The <lb/>
family talked their troubles out before him the same as <lb/>
if he wasn't there, but we reckoned it wasn't any harm <lb/>
for him to hear what they said. Generly he didn't <lb/>
seem to notice, but sometimes he did.</p>
<p>Well, two or three days went along, and everybody <lb/>
got to getting uneasy about Jubiter Dunlap. Every- <lb/>
body was asking everybody if they had any idea what <lb/>
had become of him. No, they hadn't, they said: and <lb/>
they shook their heads and said there was something <lb/>
powerful strange about it. Another and another day <lb/>
went by; then there was a report got around that praps <lb/>
he was murdered. You bet it made a big stir! Every- <lb/>
body's tongue was clacking away after that. Saturday <lb/>
two or three gangs turned out and hunted the woods to <lb/>
see if they could run across his remainders. Me and <lb/>
Tom helped, and it was noble good times and exciting. <lb/>
Tom he was so brimful of it he couldn't eat nor rest. <lb/>
He said if we could find that corpse we would be <lb/>
celebrated, and more talked about than if we got <lb/>
drownded.</p>
<p>The others got tired and give it up; but not Tom <lb/>
<pb n="193"/>
Sawyer&#x2014;that warn't his style. Saturday night he <lb/>
didn't sleep any, hardly, trying to think up a plan; <lb/>
and towards daylight in the morning he struck it. He <lb/>
snaked me out of bed and was all excited, and says:</p>
<p>"Quick, Huck, snatch on your clothes&#x2014;I've got <lb/>
it! Bloodhound!"</p>
<p>In two minutes we was tearing up the river road in <lb/>
the dark towards the village. Old Jeff Hooker had a <lb/>
bloodhound, and Tom was going to borrow him. I <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"The trail's too old, Tom&#x2014;and besides, it's rained, <lb/>
you know."</p>
<p>"It don't make any difference, Huck. If the body's <lb/>
hid in the woods anywhere around the hound will find <lb/>
it. If he's been murdered and buried, they wouldn't <lb/>
bury him deep, it ain't likely, and if the dog goes over <lb/>
the spot he'll scent him, sure. Huck, we're going to <lb/>
be celebrated, sure as you're born!"</p>
<p>He was just a-blazing; and whenever he got afire he <lb/>
was most likely to get afire all over. That was the way <lb/>
this time. In two minutes he had got it all ciphered <lb/>
out, and wasn't only just going to find the corpse&#x2014; <lb/>
no, he was going to get on the track of that murderer <lb/>
and hunt <i>him</i> down, too; and not only that, but he <lb/>
was going to stick to him till&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "you better find the corpse first; I <lb/>
reckon that's a-plenty for to-day. For all we know, <lb/>
there <i>ain't</i> any corpse and nobody hain't been mur- <lb/>
dered. That cuss could 'a' gone off somers and not <lb/>
been killed at all."</p>
<pb n="194"/>
<p>That graveled him, and he says:</p>
<p>"Huck Finn, I never see such a person as you to <lb/>
want to spoil everything. As long as <i>you</i> can't see <lb/>
anything hopeful in a thing, you won't let anybody <lb/>
else. What good can it do you to throw cold water on <lb/>
that corpse and get up that selfish theory that there <lb/>
ain't been any murder? None in the world. I don't <lb/>
see how you can act so. I wouldn't treat you like <lb/>
that, and you know it. Here we've got a noble good <lb/>
opportunity to make a ruputation, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, go ahead," I says. "I'm sorry, and I take it <lb/>
all back. I didn't mean nothing. Fix it any way <lb/>
you want it. <i>He</i> ain't any consequence to me. If <lb/>
he's killed, I'm as glad of it as you are; and if he&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I never said anything about being glad; I only&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, then, I'm as <i>sorry</i> as you are. Any way <lb/>
you druther have it, that is the way <i>I</i> druther have it. <lb/>
He&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"There ain't any druthers <i>about</i> it, Huck Finn; no- <lb/>
body said anything about druthers. And as for&#x2014;"</p>
<p>He forgot he was talking, and went tramping along, <lb/>
studying. He begun to get excited again, and pretty <lb/>
soon he says:</p>
<p>"Huck, it 'll be the bulliest thing that ever happened <lb/>
if we find the body after everybody else has quit look- <lb/>
ing, and then go ahead and hunt up the murderer. It <lb/>
won't only be an honor to us, but it 'll be an honor to <lb/>
Uncle Silas because it was us that done it. It 'll set <lb/>
him up again, you see if it don't."</p>
<p>But Old Jeff Hooker he throwed cold water on the <lb/>
<pb n="195"/>
whole business when we got to his blacksmith shop and <lb/>
told him what we come for.</p>
<p>"You can take the dog," he says, "but you ain't <lb/>
a-going to find any corpse, because there ain't any <lb/>
corpse to find. Everybody's quit looking, and they're <lb/>
right. Soon as they come to think, they knowed there <lb/>
warn't no corpse. And I'll tell you for why. What <lb/>
does a person kill another person <i>for</i>, Tom Sawyer?&#x2014; <lb/>
answer me that."</p>
<p>"Why, he&#x2014;er&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Answer up! You ain't no fool. What does he kill <lb/>
him <i>for?</i>"</p>
<p>"Well, sometimes it's for revenge, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wait. One thing at a time. Revenge, says you; <lb/>
and right you are. Now who ever had anything agin <lb/>
that poor trifling no-account? Who do you reckon <lb/>
would want to kill <i>him?</i>&#x2014;that rabbit!"</p>
<p>Tom was stuck. I reckon he hadn't thought of a <lb/>
person having to have a <i>reason</i> for killing a person be- <lb/>
fore, and now he sees it warn't likely anybody would <lb/>
have that much of a grudge against a lamb like Jubiter <lb/>
Dunlap. The blacksmith says, by and by:</p>
<p>"The revenge idea won't work, you see. Well, <lb/>
then, what's next? Robbery? B'gosh, that must 'a' <lb/>
been it, Tom! Yes, sirree, I reckon we've struck it <lb/>
this time. Some feller wanted his gallus-buckles, and <lb/>
so he&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But it was so funny he busted out laughing, and just <lb/>
went <i>on</i> laughing and laughing and laughing till he was <lb/>
'most dead, and Tom looked so put out and cheap that <lb/>
<pb n="196"/>
I knowed he was ashamed he had come, and he wished <lb/>
he hadn't. But old Hooker never let up on him. He <lb/>
raked up everything a person ever could want to kill <lb/>
another person about, and any fool could see they <lb/>
didn't any of them fit this case, and he just made no <lb/>
end of fun of the whole business and of the people <lb/>
that had been hunting the body; and he said:</p>
<p>"If they'd had any sense they'd 'a' knowed the lazy <lb/>
cuss slid out because he wanted a loafing spell after all <lb/>
this work. He'll come pottering back in a couple of <lb/>
weeks, and then how 'll you fellers feel? But, laws <lb/>
bless you, take the dog, and go and hunt his re- <lb/>
mainders. Do, Tom."</p>
<p>Then he busted out, and had another of them forty- <lb/>
rod laughs of hisn. Tom couldn't back down after all <lb/>
this, so he said, "All right, unchain him;" and the <lb/>
blacksmith done it, and we started home and left that <lb/>
old man laughing yet.</p>
<p>It was a lovely dog. There ain't any dog that's got <lb/>
a lovelier disposition than a bloodhound, and this one <lb/>
knowed us and liked us. He capered and raced <lb/>
around ever so friendly, and powerful glad to be free <lb/>
and have a holiday; but Tom was so cut up he couldn't <lb/>
take any intrust in him, and said he wished he'd stopped <lb/>
and thought a minute before he ever started on such a <lb/>
fool errand. He said old Jeff Hooker would tell every- <lb/>
body, and we'd never hear the last of it.</p>
<p>So we loafed along home down the back lanes, feel- <lb/>
ing pretty glum and not talking. When we was pass- <lb/>
ing the far corner of our tobacker field we heard the <lb/>
<pb n="197"/>
dog set up a long howl in there, and we went to the <lb/>
place and he was scratching the ground with all his <lb/>
might, and every now and then canting up his head <lb/>
sideways and fetching another howl.</p>
<p>It was a long square, the shape of a grave; the rain <lb/>
had made it sink down and show the shape. The <lb/>
minute we come and stood there we looked at one <lb/>
another and never said a word. When the dog had <lb/>
dug down only a few inches he grabbed something and <lb/>
pulled it up, and it was an arm and a sleeve. Tom <lb/>
kind of gasped out, and says:</p>
<p>"Come away, Huck&#x2014;it's found."</p>
<p>I just felt awful. We struck for the road and <lb/>
fetched the first men that come along. They got a <lb/>
spade at the crib and dug out the body, and you never <lb/>
see such an excitement. You couldn't make anything <lb/>
out of the face, but you didn't need to. Everybody <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Poor Jubiter; it's his clothes, to the last rag!"</p>
<p>Some rushed off to spread the news and tell the <lb/>
justice of the peace and have an inquest, and me and <lb/>
Tom lit out for the house. Tom was all afire and 'most <lb/>
out of breath when we come tearing in where Uncle <lb/>
Silas and Aunt Sally and Benny was. Tom sung <lb/>
out:</p>
<p>"Me and Huck's found Jubiter Dunlap's corpse all <lb/>
by ourselves with a bloodhound, after everybody else <lb/>
had quit hunting and given it up; and if it hadn't a <lb/>
been for us it never <i>would</i> 'a' been found; and he <i>was</i> <lb/>
murdered too&#x2014;they done it with a club or something <lb/>
<pb n="198"/>
like that; and I'm going to start in and find the mur- <lb/>
derer, next, and I bet I'll do it!"</p>
<p>Aunt Sally and Benny sprung up pale and astonished, <lb/>
but Uncle Silas fell right forward out of his chair on to <lb/>
the floor and groans out:</p>
<p>"Oh, my God, you've found him <i>now!</i>"</p>

<head><smcap>the arrest of uncle silas</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Them</smcap> awful words froze us solid. We couldn't <lb/>
move hand or foot for as much as half a minute. <lb/>
Then we kind of come to, and lifted the old man up <lb/>
and got him into his chair, and Benny petted him and <lb/>
kissed him and tried to comfort him, and poor old <lb/>
Aunt Sally she done the same; but, poor things, they <lb/>
was so broke up and scared and knocked out of their <lb/>
right minds that they didn't hardly know what they was <lb/>
about. With Tom it was awful; it 'most petrified him <lb/>
to think maybe he had got his uncle into a thousand <lb/>
times more trouble than ever, and maybe it wouldn't <lb/>
ever happened if he hadn't been so ambitious to get <lb/>
celebrated, and let the corpse alone the way the others <lb/>
done. But pretty soon he sort of come to himself <lb/>
again and says:</p>
<p>"Uncle Silas, don't you say another word like that. <lb/>
It's dangerous, and there ain't a shadder of truth in it."</p>
<p>Aunt Sally and Benny was thankful to hear him say <lb/>
that, and they said the same; but the old man he <lb/>
wagged his head sorrowful and hopeless, and the tears <lb/>
run down his face, and he says:</p>
<pb n="200"/>
<p>"No&#x2014;I done it; poor Jubiter, I done it!"</p>
<p>It was dreadful to hear him say it. Then he went <lb/>
on and told about it, and said it happened the day <lb/>
me and Tom come&#x2014;along about sundown. He said <lb/>
Jubiter pestered him and aggravated him till he was so <lb/>
mad he just sort of lost his mind and grabbed up a stick <lb/>
and hit him over the head with all his might, and <lb/>
Jubiter dropped in his tracks. Then he was scared and <lb/>
sorry, and got down on his knees and lifted his head <lb/>
up, and begged him to speak and say he wasn't dead; <lb/>
and before long he come to, and when he see who it <lb/>
was holding his head, he jumped like he was 'most <lb/>
scared to death, and cleared the fence and tore into the <lb/>
woods, and was gone. So he hoped he wasn't hurt <lb/>
bad.</p>
<p>"But laws," he says, "it was only just fear that <lb/>
gave him that last little spurt of strength, and of course <lb/>
it soon played out and he laid down in the bush, and <lb/>
there wasn't anybody to help him, and he died."</p>
<p>Then the old man cried and grieved, and said he was <lb/>
a murderer and the mark of Cain was on him, and he <lb/>
had disgraced his family and was going to be found <lb/>
out and hung. But Tom said:</p>
<p>"No, you ain't going to be found out. You <i>didn't</i> <lb/>
kill him. <i>One</i> lick wouldn't kill him. Somebody else <lb/>
done it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," he says, "I done it&#x2014;nobody else. <lb/>
Who else had anything against him? Who else <i>could</i> <lb/>
have anything against him?"</p>
<p>He looked up kind of like he hoped some of us could <lb/>
<pb n="201"/>
mention somebody that could have a grudge against <lb/>
that harmless no-account, but of course it warn't no <lb/>
use&#x2014;he <i>had</i> us; we couldn't say a word. He <lb/>
noticed that, and he saddened down again, and I never <lb/>
see a face so miserable and so pitiful to see. Tom <lb/>
had a sudden idea, and says:</p>
<p>"But hold on!&#x2014;somebody <i>buried</i> him. Now <lb/>
who&#x2014;"</p>
<p>He shut off sudden. I knowed the reason. It give <lb/>
me the cold shudders when he said them words, because <lb/>
right away I remembered about us seeing Uncle Silas <lb/>
prowling around with a long-handled shovel away in <lb/>
the night that night. And I knowed Benny seen him, <lb/>
too, because she was talking about it one day. The <lb/>
minute Tom shut off he changed the subject and went <lb/>
to begging Uncle Silas to keep mum, and the rest of us <lb/>
done the same, and said he <i>must</i>, and said it wasn't his <lb/>
business to tell on himself, and if he kept mum nobody <lb/>
would ever know; but if it was found out and any <lb/>
harm come to him it would break the family's hearts <lb/>
and kill them, and yet never do anybody any good. <lb/>
So at last he promised. We was all of us more com- <lb/>
fortable, then, and went to work to cheer up the old <lb/>
man. We told him all he'd got to do was to keep still, <lb/>
and it wouldn't be long till the whole thing would blow <lb/>
over and be forgot. We all said there wouldn't any- <lb/>
body ever suspect Uncle Silas, nor ever dream of such <lb/>
a thing, he being so good and kind, and having such a <lb/>
good character; and Tom says, cordial and hearty, he <lb/>
says:</p>
<pb n="202"/>
<p>"Why, just look at it a minute; just consider. <lb/>
Here is Uncle Silas, all these years a preacher&#x2014;at his <lb/>
own expense; all these years doing good with all his <lb/>
might and every way he can think of&#x2014;at his own ex- <lb/>
pense, all the time; always been loved by everybody, <lb/>
and respected; always been peaceable and minding his <lb/>
own business, the very last man in this whole deestrict <lb/>
to touch a person, and everybody knows it. Suspect <lb/>
<i>him?</i> Why, it ain't any more possible than&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"By authority of the State of Arkansaw, I arrest <lb/>
you for the murder of Jubiter Dunlap!" shouts the <lb/>
sheriff at the door.</p>
<p>It was awful. Aunt Sally and Benny flung themselves <lb/>
at Uncle Silas, screaming and crying, and hugged him <lb/>
and hung to him, and Aunt Sally said go away, she <lb/>
wouldn't ever give him up, they shouldn't have him, <lb/>
and the niggers they come crowding and crying to the <lb/>
door and&#x2014;well, I couldn't stand it; it was enough to <lb/>
break a person's heart; so I got out.</p>
<p>They took him up to the little one-horse jail in the <lb/>
village, and we all went along to tell him good-bye; <lb/>
and Tom was feeling elegant, and says to me, "We'll <lb/>
have a most noble good time and heaps of danger some <lb/>
dark night getting him out of there, Huck, and it 'll be <lb/>
talked about everywheres and we will be celebrated;" <lb/>
but the old man busted that scheme up the minute he <lb/>
whispered to him about it. He said no, it was his duty <lb/>
to stand whatever the law done to him, and he would <lb/>
stick to the jail plumb through to the end, even if <lb/>
there warn't no door to it. It disappointed Tom <lb/>
<pb n="203"/>
and graveled him a good deal, but he had to put up <lb/>
with it.</p>
<p>But he felt responsible and bound to get his uncle <lb/>
Silas free; and he told Aunt Sally, the last thing, not <lb/>
to worry, because he was going to turn in and work <lb/>
night and day and beat this game and fetch Uncle Silas <lb/>
out innocent; and she was very loving to him and <lb/>
thanked him and said she knowed he would do his very <lb/>
best. And she told us to help Benny take care of the <lb/>
house and the children, and then we had a good-bye <lb/>
cry all around and went back to the farm, and left her <lb/>
there to live with the jailer's wife a month till the trial <lb/>
in October.</p>

<head><smcap>tom sawyer discovers the murderers</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Well</smcap>, that was a hard month on us all. Poor <lb/>
Benny, she kept up the best she could, and me <lb/>
and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the <lb/>
house, but it kind of went for nothing, as you may say. <lb/>
It was the same up at the jail. We went up every day <lb/>
to see the old people, but it was awful dreary, because <lb/>
the old man warn't sleeping much, and was walking in <lb/>
his sleep considerable, and so he got to looking fagged <lb/>
and miserable, and his mind got shaky, and we all got <lb/>
afraid his troubles would break him down and kill him. <lb/>
And whenever we tried to persuade him to feel cheer- <lb/>
fuler, he only shook his head and said if we only <lb/>
knowed what it was to carry around a murderer's load <lb/>
on your heart we wouldn't talk that way. Tom and all <lb/>
of us kept telling him it <i>wasn't</i> murder, but just acci- <lb/>
dental killing, but it never made any difference&#x2014;it was <lb/>
murder, and he wouldn't have it any other way. He <lb/>
actu'ly begun to come out plain and square towards <lb/>
trial time and acknowledge that he <i>tried</i> to kill the man. <lb/>
Why, that was awful, you know. It made things seem <lb/>
fifty times as dreadful, and there warn't no more com- <lb/>
<pb n="205"/>
fort for Aunt Sally and Benny. But he promised he <lb/>
wouldn't say a word about his murder when others <lb/>
was around, and we was glad of that.</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer racked the head off of himself all that <lb/>
month trying to plan some way out for Uncle Silas, and <lb/>
many's the night he kept me up 'most all night with <lb/>
this kind of tiresome work, but he couldn't seem to get <lb/>
on the right track no way. As for me, I reckoned a <lb/>
body might as well give it up, it all looked so blue and <lb/>
I was so downhearted; but he wouldn't. He stuck to <lb/>
the business right along, and went on planning and <lb/>
thinking and ransacking his head.</p>
<p>So at last the trial come on, towards the middle of <lb/>
October, and we was all in the court. The place was <lb/>
jammed, of course. Poor old Uncle Silas, he looked <lb/>
more like a dead person than a live one, his eyes was so <lb/>
hollow and he looked so thin and so mournful. Benny <lb/>
she set on one side of him and Aunt Sally on the other, <lb/>
and they had veils on, and was full of trouble. But <lb/>
Tom he set by our lawyer, and had his finger in every- <lb/>
wheres, of course. The lawyer let him, and the judge <lb/>
let him. He 'most took the business out of the law- <lb/>
yer's hands sometimes; which was well enough, be- <lb/>
cause that was only a mud-turtle of a back-settlement <lb/>
lawyer and didn't know enough to come in when it <lb/>
rains, as the saying is.</p>
<p>They swore in the jury, and then the lawyer for the <lb/>
prostitution got up and begun. He made a terrible <lb/>
speech against the old man, that made him moan and <lb/>
groan, and made Benny and Aunt Sally cry. The way <lb/>
<pb n="206"/>
<i>he</i> told about the murder kind of knocked us all stupid <lb/>
it was so different from the old man's tale. He said <lb/>
he was going to prove that Uncle Silas was <i>seen</i> to <lb/>
kill Jubiter Dunlap by two good witnesses, and done it <lb/>
deliberate, and <i>said</i> he was going to kill him the very <lb/>
minute he hit him with the club; and they seen him hide <lb/>
Jubiter in the bushes, and they seen that Jubiter was <lb/>
stone-dead. And said Uncle Silas come later and <lb/>
lugged Jubiter down into the tobacker field, and two <lb/>
men seen him do it. And said Uncle Silas turned out, <lb/>
away in the night, and buried Jubiter, and a man seen <lb/>
him at it.</p>
<p>I says to myself, poor old Uncle Silas has been lying <lb/>
about it because he reckoned nobody seen him and he <lb/>
couldn't bear to break Aunt Sally's heart and Benny's; <lb/>
and right he was: as for me, I would 'a' lied the <lb/>
same way, and so would anybody that had any feeling, <lb/>
to save them such misery and sorrow which <i>they</i> warn't <lb/>
no ways responsible for. Well, it made our lawyer <lb/>
look pretty sick; and it knocked Tom silly, too, for a <lb/>
little spell, but then he braced up and let on that he <lb/>
warn't worried&#x2014;but I knowed he <i>was</i>, all the same. <lb/>
And the people&#x2014;my, but it made a stir amongst <lb/>
them!</p>
<p>And when that lawyer was done telling the jury what <lb/>
he was going to prove, he set down and begun to work <lb/>
his witnesses.</p>
<p>First, he called a lot of them to show that there was <lb/>
bad blood betwixt Uncle Silas and the diseased; and <lb/>
they told how they had heard Uncle Silas threaten the <lb/>
<pb n="207"/>
diseased, at one time and another, and how it got <lb/>
worse and worse and everybody was talking about it, <lb/>
and how diseased got afraid of his life, and told two or <lb/>
three of them he was certain Uncle Silas would up and <lb/>
kill him some time or another.</p>
<p>Tom and our lawyer asked them some questions; <lb/>
but it warn't no use, they stuck to what they said.</p>
<p>Next, they called up Lem Beebe, and he took the <lb/>
stand. It come into my mind, then, how Lem and Jim <lb/>
Lane had come along talking, that time, about borrow- <lb/>
ing a dog or something from Jubiter Dunlap; and that <lb/>
brought up the blackberries and the lantern; and that <lb/>
brought up Bill and Jack Withers, and how <i>they</i> passed <lb/>
by, talking about a nigger stealing Uncle Silas's corn; <lb/>
and that fetched up our old ghost that come along <lb/>
about the same time and scared us so&#x2014;and here <i>he</i> <lb/>
was too, and a privileged character, on accounts of his <lb/>
being deef and dumb and a stranger, and they had fixed <lb/>
him a chair inside the railing, where he could cross his <lb/>
legs and be comfortable, whilst the other people was all <lb/>
in a jam so they couldn't hardly breathe. So it all <lb/>
come back to me just the way it was that day; and it <lb/>
made me mournful to think how pleasant it was up to <lb/>
then, and how miserable ever since.</p>
<q><i>Lem Beebe</i>, sworn, said: "I was a-coming along, that day, second of <lb/>
September, and Jim Lane was with me, and it was towards sundown, and <lb/>
we heard loud talk, like quarrelling, and we was very close, only the hazel <lb/>
bushes between (that's along the fence); and we heard a voice say, 'I've <lb/>
told you more'n once I'd kill you,' and knowed it was this prisoner's voice; <lb/>
and then we see a club come up above the bushes and down out of sight <lb/>
again, and heard a smashing thump and then a groan or two; and then we <lb/>
<pb n="208"/>
crope soft to where we could see, and there laid Jupiter Dunlap dead, and <lb/>
this prisoner standing over him with the club; and the next he hauled the <lb/>
dead man into a clump of bushes and hid him, and then we stooped low, <lb/>
to be out of sight, and got away."</q>
<p>Well, it was awful. It kind of froze everybody's <lb/>
blood to hear it, and the house was 'most as still whilst <lb/>
he was telling it as if there warn't nobody in it. And <lb/>
when he was done, you could hear them gasp and sigh, <lb/>
all over the house, and look at one another the same <lb/>
as to say, "Ain't it perfectly terrible&#x2014;ain't it awful!"</p>
<p>Now happened a thing that astonished me. All the <lb/>
time the first witnesses was proving the bad blood and <lb/>
the threats and all that, Tom Sawyer was alive and lay- <lb/>
ing for them; and the minute they was through, he <lb/>
went for them, and done his level best to catch them in <lb/>
lies and spile their testimony. But now, how different. <lb/>
When Lem first begun to talk, and never said anything <lb/>
about speaking to Jubiter or trying to borrow a dog <lb/>
off of him, he was all alive and laying for Lem, and you <lb/>
could see he was getting ready to cross-question him to <lb/>
death pretty soon, and then I judged him and me would <lb/>
go on the stand by and by and tell what we heard him <lb/>
and Jim Lane say. But the next time I looked at Tom <lb/>
I got the cold shivers. Why, he was in the brownest <lb/>
study you ever see&#x2014;miles and miles away. He warn't <lb/>
hearing a word Lem Beebe was saying; and when he <lb/>
got through he was still in that brown-study, just the <lb/>
same. Our lawyer joggled him, and then he looked up <lb/>
startled, and says, "Take the witness if you want him. <lb/>
Lemme alone&#x2014;I want to think."</p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>Well, that beat me. I couldn't understand it. And <lb/>
Benny and her mother&#x2014;oh, they looked sick, they <lb/>
was so troubled. They shoved their veils to one side <lb/>
and tried to get his eye, but it warn't any use, and I <lb/>
couldn't get his eye either. So the mud-turtle he <lb/>
tackled the witness, but it didn't amount to nothing; <lb/>
and he made a mess of it.</p>
<p>Then they called up Jim Lane, and he told the very <lb/>
same story over again, exact. Tom never listened to <lb/>
this one at all, but set there thinking and thinking, miles <lb/>
and miles away. So the mud-turtle went in alone <lb/>
again and come out just as flat as he done before. The <lb/>
lawyer for the prostitution looked very comfortable, <lb/>
but the judge looked disgusted. You see, Tom was <lb/>
just the same as a regular lawyer, nearly, because it <lb/>
was Arkansaw law for a prisoner to choose anybody he <lb/>
wanted to help his lawyer, and Tom had had Uncle <lb/>
Silas shove him into the case, and now he was botching <lb/>
it and you could see the judge didn't like it much.</p>
<p>All that the mud-turtle got out of Lem and Jim was <lb/>
this: he asked them:</p>
<p>"Why didn't you go and tell what you saw?"</p>
<p>"We was afraid we would get mixed up in it our- <lb/>
selves. And we was just starting down the river <lb/>
a-hunting for all the week besides; but as soon as we <lb/>
come back we found out they'd been searching for the <lb/>
body, so then we went and told Brace Dunlap all <lb/>
about it."</p>
<p>"When was that?"</p>
<p>"Saturday night, September 9th."</p>
<pb n="210"/>
<p>The judge he spoke up and says:</p>
<p>"Mr. Sheriff, arrest these two witnesses on suspicions <lb/>
of being accessionary after the fact to the murder."</p>
<p>The lawyer for the prostitution jumps up all excited, <lb/>
and says:</p>
<p>"Your honor! I protest against this extraordi&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Set down!" says the judge, pulling his bowie and <lb/>
laying it on his pulpit. "I beg you to respect the <lb/>
Court."</p>
<p>So he done it. Then he called Bill Withers.</p>
<q><i>Bill Withers</i>, sworn, said: "I was coming along about sundown, <lb/>
Saturday, September 2d, by the prisoner's field, and my brother Jack was <lb/>
with me, and we seen a man toting off something heavy on his back and <lb/>
allowed it was a nigger stealing corn; we couldn't see distinct; next we <lb/>
made out that it was one man carrying another; and the way it hung, so <lb/>
kind of limp, we judged it was somebody that was drunk; and by the <lb/>
man's walk we said it was Parson Silas, and we judged he had found Sam <lb/>
Cooper drunk in the road, which he was always trying to reform him, and <lb/>
was toting him out of danger."</q>
<p>It made the people shiver to think of poor old Uncle <lb/>
Silas toting off the diseased down to the place in his <lb/>
tobacker field where the dog dug up the body, but <lb/>
there warn't much sympathy around amongst the faces, <lb/>
and I heard one cuss say, "'Tis the coldest blooded <lb/>
work I ever struck, lugging a murdered man around <lb/>
like that, and going to bury him like a animal, and him <lb/>
a preacher at that."</p>
<p>Tom he went on thinking, and never took no notice; <lb/>
so our lawyer took the witness and done the best he <lb/>
could, and it was plenty poor enough.</p>
<pb n="211"/>
<p>Then Jack Withers he come on the stand and told the <lb/>
same tale, just like Bill done.</p>
<p>And after him comes Brace Dunlap, and he was look- <lb/>
ing very mournful, and most crying; and there was a <lb/>
rustle and a stir all around, and everybody got ready to <lb/>
listen, and lots of the women folks said, "Poor cretur, <lb/>
poor cretur," and you could see a many of them wip- <lb/>
ing their eyes.</p>
<q><i>Bruce Dunlap</i>, sworn, said: "I was in considerable trouble a long <lb/>
time about my poor brother, but I reckoned things warn't near so bad as <lb/>
he made out, and I couldn't make myself believe anybody would have the <lb/>
heart to hurt a poor harmless cretur like that"&#x2014;[by jings, I was sure I seen <lb/>
Tom give a kind of a faint little start, and then look disappointed again]&#x2014; <lb/>
"and you know I <i>couldn't</i> think a preacher would hurt him&#x2014;it warn't <lb/>
natural to think such an onlikely thing&#x2014;so I never paid much attention, <lb/>
and now I sha'n't ever, ever forgive myself; for if I had a done different, <lb/>
my poor brother would be with me this day, and not laying yonder mur- <lb/>
dered, and him so harmless." He kind of broke down there and choked <lb/>
up, and waited to get his voice; and people all around said the most pitiful <lb/>
things, and women cried; and it was very still in there, and solemn, and <lb/>
old Uncle Silas, poor thing, he give a groan right out so everybody heard <lb/>
him. Then Brace he went on, "Saturday, September 2d, he didn't come <lb/>
home to supper. By-and-by I got a little uneasy, and one of my niggers <lb/>
went over to this prisoner's place, but come back and said he warn't there. <lb/>
So I got uneasier and uneasier, and couldn't rest. I went to bed, but I <lb/>
couldn't sleep; and turned out, away late in the night, and went wander- <lb/>
ing over to this prisoner's place and all around about there a good while, <lb/>
hoping I would run across my poor brother, and never knowing he was out <lb/>
of his troubles and gone to a better shore&#x2014;" So he broke down and <lb/>
choked up again, and most all the women was crying now. Pretty soon he <lb/>
got another start and says: "But it warn't no use; so at last I went home <lb/>
and tried to get some sleep, but couldn't. Well, in a day or two everybody <lb/>
was uneasy, and they got to talking about this prisoner's threats, and took <lb/>
to the idea, which I didn't take no stock in, that my brother was murdered; <lb/>
so they hunted around and tried to find his body, but couldn't and give it <lb/>
<pb n="212"/>
up. And so I reckoned he was gone off somers to have a little peace, and <lb/>
would come back to us when his troubles was kind of healed. But late <lb/>
Saturday night, the 9th, Lem Beebe and Jim Lane come to my house and <lb/>
told me all&#x2014;told me the whole awful 'sassination, and my heart was <lb/>
broke. And <i>then</i> I remembered something that hadn't took no hold of me <lb/>
at the time, because reports said this prisoner had took to walking in his <lb/>
sleep and doing all kind of things of no consequence, not knowing what he <lb/>
was about. I will tell you what that thing was that come back into my <lb/>
memory. Away late that awful Saturday night when I was wandering <lb/>
around about this prisoner's place, grieving and troubled, I was down by <lb/>
the corner of the tobacker-field and I heard a sound like digging in a gritty <lb/>
soil; and I crope nearer and peeped through the vines that hung on the <lb/>
rail fence and seen this prisoner <i>shoveling</i>&#x2014;shoveling with a long-handled <lb/>
shovel&#x2014;heaving earth into a big hole that was most filled up; his back <lb/>
was to me, but it was bright moonlight and I knowed him by his old green <lb/>
baize work-gown with a splattery white patch in the middle of the back <lb/>
like somebody had hit him with a snowball. <i>He was burying the man he'd <lb/>
murdered!"</i></q>
<p>And he slumped down in his chair crying and sob- <lb/>
bing, and 'most everybody in the house busted out <lb/>
wailing, and crying, and saying, "Oh, it's awful&#x2014; <lb/>
awful&#x2014;horrible! and there was a most tremendous ex- <lb/>
citement, and you couldn't hear yourself think; and <lb/>
right in the midst of it up jumps old Uncle Silas, white <lb/>
as a sheet, and sings out:</p>
<p>"<i>It's true, every word&#x2014;I murdered him in cold <lb/>
blood!"</i></p>
<p>By Jackson, it petrified them! People rose up wild <lb/>
all over the house, straining and staring for a better look <lb/>
at him, and the judge was hammering with his mallet <lb/>
and the sheriff yelling "Order&#x2014;order in the court&#x2014; <lb/>
order!"</p>
<p>And all the while the old man stood there a-quaking <lb/>
and his eyes a-burning, and not looking at his wife and <lb/>
<pb n="213"/>
daughter, which was clinging to him and begging him <lb/>
to keep still, but pawing them off with his hands and <lb/>
saying he <i>would</i> clear his black soul from crime, he <lb/>
<i>would</i> heave off this load that was more than he could <lb/>
bear, and he <i>wouldn't</i> bear it another hour! And <lb/>
then he raged right along with his awful tale, every- <lb/>
body a-staring and gasping, judge, jury, lawyers, and <lb/>
everybody, and Benny and Aunt Sally crying their <lb/>
hearts out. And by George, Tom Sawyer never <lb/>
looked at him once! Never once&#x2014;just set there <lb/>
gazing with all his eyes at something else, I couldn't <lb/>
tell what. And so the old man raged right along, <lb/>
pouring his words out like a stream of fire:</p>
<p>"I killed him! I am guilty! But I never had the <lb/>
notion in my life to hurt him or harm him, spite of all <lb/>
them lies about my threatening him, till the very <lb/>
minute I raised the club&#x2014;then my heart went cold!&#x2014; <lb/>
then the pity all went out of it, and I struck to kill! In <lb/>
that one moment all my wrongs come into my mind; <lb/>
all the insults that that man and the scoundrel his <lb/>
brother, there, had put upon me, and how they laid in <lb/>
together to ruin me with the people, and take away <lb/>
my good name, and <i>drive</i> me to some deed that would <lb/>
destroy me and my family that hadn't ever done <i>them</i> <lb/>
no harm, so help me God! And they done it in a mean <lb/>
revenge&#x2014;for why? Because my innocent pure girl <lb/>
here at my side wouldn't marry that rich, insolent, <lb/>
ignorant coward, Brace Dunlap, who's been sniveling <lb/>
here over a brother he never cared a brass farthing <lb/>
for"&#x2014;[I see Tom give a jump and look glad <i>this</i> time, <lb/>
<pb n="214"/>
to a dead certainty]&#x2014;"and in that moment I've told <lb/>
you about, I forgot my God and remembered only my <lb/>
heart's bitterness, God forgive me, and I struck to kill. <lb/>
In one second I was miserably sorry&#x2014;oh, filled with <lb/>
remorse; but I thought of my poor family, and I <i>must</i> <lb/>
hide what I'd done for their sakes; and I did hide that <lb/>
corpse in the bushes; and presently I carried it to the <lb/>
tobacker field; and in the deep night I went with my <lb/>
shovel and buried it where&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Up jumps Tom and shouts:</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i>, I've got it!" and waves his hand, oh, ever <lb/>
so fine and starchy, towards the old man, and says:</p>
<p>"Set down! A murder <i>was</i> done, but you never <lb/>
had no hand in it!"</p>
<p>Well, sir, you could a heard a pin drop. And the <lb/>
old man he sunk down kind of bewildered in his seat <lb/>
and Aunt Sally and Benny didn't know it, because they <lb/>
was so astonished and staring at Tom with their <lb/>
mouths open and not knowing what they was about. <lb/>
And the whole house the same. <i>I</i> never seen people <lb/>
look so helpless and tangled up, and I hain't ever seen <lb/>
eyes bug out and gaze without a blink the way theirn <lb/>
did. Tom says, perfectly ca'm:</p>
<p>"Your honor, may I speak?"</p>
<p>"For God's sake, yes&#x2014;go on!" says the judge, so <lb/>
astonished and mixed up he didn't know what he was <lb/>
about hardly.</p>
<p>Then Tom he stood there and waited a second or two <lb/>
&#x2014;that was for to work up an "effect," as he calls it <lb/>
&#x2014;then he started in just as ca'm as ever, and says:</p>
<pb n="215"/>
<p>"For about two weeks now there's been a little bill <lb/>
sticking on the front of this courthouse offering two <lb/>
thousand dollars reward for a couple of big di'monds <lb/>
&#x2014;stole at St. Louis. Them di'monds is worth twelve <lb/>
thousand dollars. But never mind about that till I get <lb/>
to it. Now about this murder. I will tell you all <lb/>
about it&#x2014;how it happened&#x2014;who done it&#x2014;every <lb/>
<i>de</i>tail."</p>
<p>You could see everybody nestle now, and begin to <lb/>
listen for all they was worth.</p>
<p>"This man here, Brace Dunlap, that's been sniveling <lb/>
so about his dead brother that <i>you</i> know he never <lb/>
cared a straw for, wanted to marry that young girl <lb/>
there, and she wouldn't have him. So he told Uncle <lb/>
Silas he would make him sorry. Uncle Silas knowed <lb/>
how powerful he was, and how little chance he had <lb/>
against such a man, and he was scared and worried, and <lb/>
done everything he could think of to smooth him over <lb/>
and get him to be good to him: he even took his no- <lb/>
account brother Jubiter on the farm and give him wages <lb/>
and stinted his own family to pay them; and Jubiter <lb/>
done everything his brother could contrive to insult <lb/>
Uncle Silas, and fret and worry him, and try to drive <lb/>
Uncle Silas into doing him a hurt, so as to injure Uncle <lb/>
Silas with the people. And it done it. Everybody <lb/>
turned against him and said the meanest kind of things <lb/>
about him, and it graduly broke his heart&#x2014;yes, and <lb/>
he was so worried and distressed that often he warn't <lb/>
hardly in his right mind.</p>
<p>"Well, on that Saturday that we've had so much <lb/>
<pb n="216"/>
trouble about, two of these witnesses here, Lem Beebe <lb/>
and Jim Lane, come along by where Uncle Silas and <lb/>
Jubiter Dunlap was at work&#x2014;and that much of what <lb/>
they've said is true, the rest is lies. They didn't hear <lb/>
Uncle Silas say he would kill Jubiter; they didn't hear <lb/>
no blow struck; they didn't see no dead man, and they <lb/>
didn't see Uncle Silas hide anything in the bushes. <lb/>
Look at them now&#x2014;how they set there, wishing they <lb/>
hadn't been so handy with their tongues; anyway, <lb/>
they'll wish it before I get done.</p>
<p>"That same Saturday evening Bill and Jack Withers <lb/>
<i>did</i> see one man lugging off another one. That much <lb/>
of what they said is true, and the rest is lies. First off <lb/>
they thought it was a nigger stealing Uncle Silas's corn <lb/>
&#x2014;you notice it makes them look silly, now, to find out <lb/>
somebody overheard them say that. That's because <lb/>
they found out by and by who it was that was doing <lb/>
the lugging, and <i>they</i> know best why they swore here <lb/>
that they took it for Uncle Silas by the gait&#x2014;which it <lb/>
<i>wasn't</i>, and they knowed it when they swore to that lie.</p>
<p>"A man out in the moonlight <i>did</i> see a murdered <lb/>
person put under ground in the tobacker field&#x2014;but it <lb/>
wasn't Uncle Silas that done the burying. He was in <lb/>
his bed at that very time.</p>
<p>"Now, then, before I go on, I want to ask you if <lb/>
you've ever noticed this: that people, when they're <lb/>
thinking deep, or when they're worried, are most always <lb/>
doing something with their hands, and they don't know <lb/>
it, and don't notice what it is their hands are doing. <lb/>
Some stroke their chins; some stroke their noses; some <lb/>
<pb n="217"/>
stroke up <i>under</i> their chin with their hand; some twirl <lb/>
a chain, some fumble a button, then there's some that <lb/>
draws a figure or a letter with their finger on their <lb/>
cheek, or under their chin or on their under lip. That's <lb/>
<i>my</i> way. When I'm restless, or worried, or thinking <lb/>
hard, I draw capital V's on my cheek or on my under <lb/>
lip or under my chin, and never anything <i>but</i> capital <lb/>
V's&#x2014;and half the time I don't notice it and don't <lb/>
know I'm doing it."</p>
<p>That was odd. That is just what I do; only I make <lb/>
an O. And I could see people nodding to one another, <lb/>
same as they do when they mean "<i>That's</i> so."</p>
<p>"Now, then, I'll go on. That same Saturday&#x2014;no, <lb/>
it was the night before&#x2014;there was a steamboat laying <lb/>
at Flagler's Landing, forty miles above here, and it <lb/>
was raining and storming like the nation. And there <lb/>
was a thief aboard, and he had them two big di'monds <lb/>
that's advertised out here on this courthouse door; <lb/>
and he slipped ashore with his hand-bag and struck <lb/>
out into the dark and the storm, and he was a-hoping <lb/>
he could get to this town all right and be safe. But he <lb/>
had two pals aboard the boat, hiding, and he knowed <lb/>
they was going to kill him the first chance they got and <lb/>
take the di'monds; because all three stole them, and <lb/>
then this fellow he got hold of them and skipped.</p>
<p>"Well, he hadn't been gone more'n ten minutes be- <lb/>
fore his pals found it out, and they jumped ashore and <lb/>
lit out after him. Prob'ly they burnt matches and <lb/>
found his tracks. Anyway, they dogged along after <lb/>
him all day Saturday and kept out of his sight; and <lb/>
<pb n="218"/>
towards sundown he come to the bunch of sycamores <lb/>
down by Uncle Silas's field, and he went in there to <lb/>
get a disguise out of his hand-bag and put it on before <lb/>
he showed himself here in the town&#x2014;and mind you he <lb/>
done that just a little after the time that Uncle Silas was <lb/>
hitting Jubiter Dunlap over the head with a club&#x2014;for <lb/>
he <i>did</i> hit him.</p>
<p>"But the minute the pals see that thief slide into the <lb/>
bunch of sycamores, they jumped out of the bushes <lb/>
and slid in after him.</p>
<p>"They fell on him and clubbed him to death.</p>
<p>"Yes, for all he screamed and howled so, they never <lb/>
had no mercy on him, but clubbed him to death. And <lb/>
two men that was running along the road heard him <lb/>
yelling that way, and they made a rush into the syca- <lb/>
more bunch&#x2014;which was where they was bound for, <lb/>
anyway&#x2014;and when the pals saw them they lit out and <lb/>
the two new men after them a-chasing them as tight as <lb/>
they could go. But only a minute or two&#x2014;then these <lb/>
two new men slipped back very quiet into the syca- <lb/>
mores.</p>
<p>"<i>Then</i> what did they do? I will tell you what they <lb/>
done. They found where the thief had got his disguise <lb/>
out of his carpet-sack to put on; so one of them strips <lb/>
and puts on that disguise."</p>
<p>Tom waited a little here, for some more "effect"&#x2014; <lb/>
then he says, very deliberate:</p>
<p>"The man that put on that dead man's disguise was <lb/>
&#x2014;<i>Jubiter Dunlap!</i>"</p>
<p>"Great Scott!" everybody shouted, all over the <lb/>
<pb n="219"/>
house, and old Uncle Silas he looked perfectly <lb/>
astonished.</p>
<p>"Yes, it was Jubiter Dunlap. Not dead, you see. <lb/>
Then they pulled off the dead man's boots and put <lb/>
Jubiter Dunlap's old ragged shoes on the corpse and put <lb/>
the corpse's boots on Jubiter Dunlap. Then Jubiter <lb/>
Dunlap stayed where he was, and the other man lugged <lb/>
the dead body off in the twilight; and after midnight <lb/>
he went to Uncle Silas's house, and took his old green <lb/>
work-robe off of the peg where it always hangs in the <lb/>
passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and put it on, <lb/>
and stole the long-handled shovel and went off down <lb/>
into the tobacker field and buried the murdered man."</p>
<p>He stopped, and stood half a minute. Then&#x2014;</p>
<p>"And who do you reckon the murdered man <i>was?</i> <lb/>
It was&#x2014;<i>Jake</i> Dunlap, the long-lost burglar!"</p>
<p>"Great Scott!"</p>
<p>"And the man that buried him was&#x2014;<i>Brace</i> Dunlap, <lb/>
his brother!"</p>
<p>"Great Scott!"</p>
<p>"And who do you reckon is this mowing idiot here <lb/>
that's letting on all these weeks to be a deef and dumb <lb/>
stranger? It's&#x2014;<i>Jubiter</i> Dunlap!"</p>
<p>My land, they all busted out in a howl, and you <lb/>
never see the like of that excitement since the day you <lb/>
was born. And Tom he made a jump for Jubiter and <lb/>
snaked off his goggles and his false whiskers, and there <lb/>
was the murdered man, sure enough, just as alive as <lb/>
anybody! And Aunt Sally and Benny they went to <lb/>
hugging and crying and kissing and smothering old <lb/>
<pb n="220"/>
Uncle Silas to that degree he was more muddled and <lb/>
confused and mushed up in his mind than he ever was <lb/>
before, and that is saying considerable. And next, <lb/>
people begun to yell:</p>
<p>"Tom Sawyer! Tom Sawyer! Shut up every- <lb/>
body, and let him go on! Go on, Tom Sawyer!"</p>
<p>Which made him feel uncommon bully, for it was <lb/>
nuts for Tom Sawyer to be a public character that- <lb/>
away, and a hero, as he calls it. So when it was all <lb/>
quiet, he says:</p>
<p>"There ain't much left, only this. When that man <lb/>
there, Bruce Dunlap, had most worried the life and <lb/>
sense out of Uncle Silas till at last he plumb lost his <lb/>
mind and hit this other blatherskite, his brother, with a <lb/>
club, I reckon he seen his chance. Jubiter broke for <lb/>
the woods to hide, and I reckon the game was for him <lb/>
to slide out, in the night, and leave the country. <lb/>
Then Brace would make everybody believe Uncle Silas <lb/>
killed him and hid his body somers; and that would <lb/>
ruin Uncle Silas and drive <i>him</i> out of the country&#x2014; <lb/>
hang him, maybe; I dunno. But when they found <lb/>
their dead brother in the sycamores without knowing <lb/>
him, because he was so battered up, they see they had <lb/>
a better thing; disguise <i>both</i> and bury Jake and dig <lb/>
him up presently all dressed up in Jubiter's clothes, <lb/>
and hire Jim Lane and Bill Withers and the others to <lb/>
swear to some handy lies&#x2014;which they done. And <lb/>
there they set, now, and I told them they would be <lb/>
looking sick before I got done, and that is the way <lb/>
they're looking now.</p>
<pb n="221"/>
<p>"Well, me and Huck Finn here, we come down on <lb/>
the boat with the thieves, and the dead one told us all <lb/>
about the di'monds, and said the others would murder <lb/>
him if they got the chance; and we was going to help <lb/>
him all we could. We was bound for the sycamores <lb/>
when we heard them killing him in there; but we was <lb/>
in there in the early morning after the storm and <lb/>
allowed nobody hadn't been killed, after all. And <lb/>
when we see Jubiter Dunlap here spreading around in <lb/>
the very same disguise Jake told us <i>he</i> was going to <lb/>
wear, we thought it was Jake his own self&#x2014;and he was <lb/>
goo-gooing deef and dumb, and <i>that</i> was according to <lb/>
agreement.</p>
<p>"Well, me and Huck went on hunting for the corpse <lb/>
after the others quit, and we found it. And was proud, <lb/>
too; but Uncle Silas he knocked us crazy by telling us <lb/>
<i>he</i> killed the man. So we was mighty sorry we found <lb/>
the body, and was bound to save Uncle Silas's neck if <lb/>
we could; and it was going to be tough work, too, <lb/>
because he wouldn't let us break him out of prison the <lb/>
way we done with our old nigger Jim.</p>
<p>"I done everything I could the whole month to think <lb/>
up some way to save Uncle Silas, but I couldn't strike <lb/>
a thing. So when we come into court to-day I come <lb/>
empty, and couldn't see no chance anywheres. But <lb/>
by and by I had a glimpse of something that set me <lb/>
thinking&#x2014;just a little wee glimpse&#x2014;only that, and <lb/>
not enough to make sure; but it set me thinking hard <lb/>
&#x2014;and <i>watching</i>, when I was only letting on to think; <lb/>
and by and by, sure enough, when Uncle Silas was pil- <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
ing out that stuff about <i>him</i> killing Jubiter Dunlap, I <lb/>
catched that glimpse again, and this time I jumped up <lb/>
and shut down the proceedings, because I <i>knowed</i> <lb/>
Jubiter Dunlap was a-setting here before me. I knowed <lb/>
him by a thing which I seen him do&#x2014;and I remem- <lb/>
bered it. I'd seen him do it when I was here a year <lb/>
ago."</p>
<p>He stopped then, and studied a minute&#x2014;laying for <lb/>
an "effect"&#x2014;I knowed it perfectly well. Then he <lb/>
turned off like he was going to leave the platform, and <lb/>
says, kind of lazy and indifferent:</p>
<p>"Well, I believe that is all."</p>
<p>Why, you never heard such a howl!&#x2014;and it come <lb/>
from the whole house:</p>
<p>"What <i>was</i> it you seen him do? Stay where you <lb/>
are, you little devil! You think you are going to <lb/>
work a body up till his mouth's a-watering and stop <lb/>
there? What <i>was</i> it he done?"</p>
<p>That was it, you see&#x2014;he just done it to get an <lb/>
"effect"; you couldn't 'a' pulled him off of that plat- <lb/>
form with a yoke of oxen.</p>
<p>"Oh, it wasn't anything much," he says. "I seen <lb/>
him looking a little excited when he found Uncle Silas <lb/>
was actuly fixing to hang himself for a murder that <lb/>
warn't ever done; and he got more and more nervous <lb/>
and worried, I a-watching him sharp but not seeming <lb/>
to look at him&#x2014;and all of a sudden his hands begun <lb/>
to work and fidget, and pretty soon his left crept up <lb/>
and <i>his finger drawed a cross on his cheek</i>, and then I <lb/>
<i>had</i> him!"</p>
<pb n="223"/>
<p>Well, then they ripped and howled and stomped and <lb/>
clapped their hands till Tom Sawyer was that proud <lb/>
and happy he didn't know what to do with him- <lb/>
self.</p>
<p>And then the judge he looked down over his pulpit <lb/>
and says:</p>
<p>"My boy, did you <i>see</i> all the various details of this <lb/>
strange conspiracy and tragedy that you've been de- <lb/>
scribing?"</p>
<p>"No, your honor, I didn't see any of them."</p>
<p>"Didn't see any of them! Why, you've told the <lb/>
whole history straight through, just the same as if <lb/>
you'd seen it with your eyes. How did you manage <lb/>
that?"</p>
<p>Tom says, kind of easy and comfortable:</p>
<p>"Oh, just noticing the evidence and piecing this and <lb/>
that together, your honor; just an ordinary little bit of <lb/>
detective work; anybody could 'a' done it."</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind! Not two in a million could <lb/>
'a' done it. You are a very remarkable boy."</p>
<p>Then they let go and give Tom another smashing <lb/>
round, and he&#x2014;well, he wouldn't 'a' sold out for a <lb/>
silver mine. Then the judge says:</p>
<p>"But are you certain you've got this curious history <lb/>
straight?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly, your honor. Here is Brace Dunlap&#x2014; <lb/>
let him deny his share of it if he wants to take the <lb/>
chance; I'll engage to make him wish he hadn't said <lb/>
anything&#x2026;&#x2026; Well, you see <i>he's</i> pretty quiet. And <lb/>
his brother's pretty quiet, and them four witnesses that <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
lied so and got paid for it, they're pretty quiet. And <lb/>
as for Uncle Silas, it ain't any use for him to put in <lb/>
his oar, I wouldn't believe him under oath!"</p>
<p>Well, sir, that fairly made them shout; and even the <lb/>
judge he let go and laughed. Tom he was just feeling <lb/>
like a rainbow. When they was done laughing he <lb/>
looks up at the judge and says:</p>
<p>"Your honor, there's a thief in this house."</p>
<p>"A thief?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. And he's got them twelve-thousand- <lb/>
dollar di'monds on him."</p>
<p>By gracious, but it made a stir! Everybody went <lb/>
shouting:</p>
<p>"Which is him? which is him? p'int him out!"</p>
<p>And the judge says:</p>
<p>"Point him out, my lad. Sheriff, you will arrest <lb/>
him. Which one is it?"</p>
<p>Tom says:</p>
<p>"This late dead man here&#x2014;Jubiter Dunlap."</p>
<p>Then there was another thundering let-go of astonish- <lb/>
ment and excitement; but Jubiter, which was astonished <lb/>
enough before, was just fairly putrified with astonish- <lb/>
ment this time. And he spoke up, about half crying, <lb/>
and says:</p>
<p>"Now <i>that's</i> a lie. Your honor, it ain't fair; I'm <lb/>
plenty bad enough without that. I done the other <lb/>
things&#x2014;Brace he put me up to it, and persuaded me, <lb/>
and promised he'd make me rich, some day, and I done <lb/>
it, and I'm sorry I done it, and I wisht I hadn't; but I <lb/>
hain't stole no di'monds, and I hain't <i>got</i> no di'monds; <lb/>
<pb n="225"/>
I wisht I may never stir if it ain't so. The sheriff can <lb/>
search me and see."</p>
<p>Tom says:</p>
<p>"Your honor, it wasn't right to call him a thief, and <lb/>
I'll let up on that a little. He did steal the di'monds, <lb/>
but he didn't know it. He stole them from his brother <lb/>
Jake when he was laying dead, after Jake had stole them <lb/>
from the other thieves; but Jubiter didn't know he was <lb/>
stealing them; and he's been swelling around here with <lb/>
them a month; yes, sir, twelve thousand dollars' worth <lb/>
of di'monds on him&#x2014;all that riches, and going around <lb/>
here every day just like a poor man. Yes, your honor, <lb/>
he's got them on him now."</p>
<p>The judge spoke up and says:</p>
<p>"Search him, sheriff."</p>
<p>Well, sir, the sheriff he ransacked him high and low, <lb/>
and everywhere: searched his hat, socks, seams, boots, <lb/>
everything&#x2014;and Tom he stood there quiet, laying for <lb/>
another of them effects of hisn. Finally the sheriff he <lb/>
give it up, and everybody looked disappointed, and <lb/>
Jubiter says:</p>
<p>"There, now! what'd I tell you?"</p>
<p>And the judge says:</p>
<p>"It appears you were mistaken this time, my <lb/>
boy."</p>
<p>Then Tom took an attitude and let on to be studying <lb/>
with all his might, and scratching his head. Then all <lb/>
of a sudden he glanced up chipper, and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, now I've got it! I'd forgot."</p>
<p>Which was a lie, and I knowed it. Then he says:</p>
<pb n="226"/>
<p>"Will somebody be good enough to lend me a little <lb/>
small screwdriver? There was one in your brother's <lb/>
hand-bag that you smouched, Jubiter, but I reckon <lb/>
you didn't fetch it with you."</p>
<p>"No, I didn't. I didn't want it, and I give it <lb/>
away."</p>
<p>"That was because you didn't know what it was <lb/>
for."</p>
<p>Jubiter had his boots on again, by now, and when <lb/>
the thing Tom wanted was passed over the people's <lb/>
heads till it got to him, he says to Jubiter:</p>
<p>"Put up your foot on this chair." And he kneeled <lb/>
down and begun to unscrew the heel-plate, everybody <lb/>
watching; and when he got that big di'mond out of <lb/>
that boot-heel and held it up and let it flash and blaze <lb/>
and squirt sunlight everwhichaway, it just took every- <lb/>
body's breath; and Jubiter he looked so sick and sorry <lb/>
you never see the like of it. And when Tom held up <lb/>
the other di'mond he looked sorrier than ever. Land! <lb/>
he was thinking how he would 'a' skipped out and been <lb/>
rich and independent in a foreign land if he'd only had <lb/>
the luck to guess what the screwdriver was in the <lb/>
carpet-bag for.</p>
<p>Well, it was a most exciting time, take it all around, <lb/>
and Tom got cords of glory. The judge took the <lb/>
di'monds, and stood up in his pulpit, and cleared his <lb/>
throat, and shoved his spectacles back on his head, and <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"I'll keep them and notify the owners; and when <lb/>
they send for them it will be a real pleasure to me to <lb/>
<pb n="227"/>
hand you the two thousand dollars, for you've earned <lb/>
the money&#x2014;yes, and you've earned the deepest and <lb/>
most sincerest thanks of this community besides, for <lb/>
lifting a wronged and innocent family out of ruin and <lb/>
shame, and saving a good and honorable man from a <lb/>
felon's death, and for exposing to infamy and the pun- <lb/>
ishment of the law a cruel and odious scoundrel and his <lb/>
miserable creatures!"</p>
<p>Well, sir, if there'd been a brass band to bust out <lb/>
some music, then, it would 'a' been just the perfectest <lb/>
thing I ever see, and Tom Sawyer he said the same.</p>
<p>Then the sheriff he nabbed Brace Dunlap and his <lb/>
crowd, and by and by next month the judge had them <lb/>
up for trial and jailed the whole lot. And everybody <lb/>
crowded back to Uncle Silas's little old church, and was <lb/>
ever so loving and kind to him and the family and <lb/>
couldn't do enough for them; and Uncle Silas he <lb/>
preached them the blamedest jumbledest idiotic sermons <lb/>
you ever struck, and would tangle you up so you <lb/>
couldn't find your way home in daylight; but the peo- <lb/>
ple never let on but what they thought it was the clear- <lb/>
est and brightest and elegantest sermons that ever was; <lb/>
and they would set there and cry, for love and pity; <lb/>
but, by George, they give me the jim-jams and the fan- <lb/>
tods and caked up what brains I had, and turned them <lb/>
solid; but by and by they loved the old man's intellects <lb/>
back into him again, and he was as sound in his skull as <lb/>
ever he was, which ain't no flattery, I reckon. And <lb/>
so the whole family was as happy as birds, and nobody <lb/>
could be gratefuler and lovinger than what they was to <lb/>
<pb n="228"/>
Tom Sawyer; and the same to me, though I hadn't <lb/>
done nothing. And when the two thousand dollars <lb/>
come, Tom give half of it to me, and never told any- <lb/>
body so, which didn't surprise me, because I knowed <lb/>
him.</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> following curious history was related to me by <lb/>
a chance railway acquaintance. He was a gentle- <lb/>
man more than seventy years of age, and his thoroughly <lb/>
good and gentle face and earnest and sincere manner <lb/>
imprinted the unmistakable stamp of truth upon every <lb/>
statement which fell from his lips. He said:</p>
<p>You know in what reverence the royal white elephant <lb/>
of Siam is held by the people of that country. You <lb/>
know it is sacred to kings, only kings may possess it, <lb/>
and that it is, indeed, in a measure even superior to <lb/>
kings, since it receives not merely honor but worship. <lb/>
Very well; five years ago, when the troubles concern- <lb/>
ing the frontier line arose between Great Britain and <lb/>
Siam, it was presently manifest that Siam had been in <lb/>
the wrong. Therefore every reparation was quickly <lb/>
made, and the British representative stated that he <lb/>
was satisfied and the past should be forgotten. This <lb/>
<pb n="230"/>
greatly relieved the King of Siam, and partly as a <lb/>
token of gratitude, but partly also, perhaps, to wipe <lb/>
out any little remaining vestige of unpleasantness <lb/>
which England might feel toward him, he wished to <lb/>
send the Queen a present&#x2014;the sole sure way of <lb/>
propitiating an enemy, according to Oriental ideas. <lb/>
This present ought not only to be a royal one, but <lb/>
transcendently royal. Wherefore, what offering could <lb/>
be so meet as that of a white elephant? My position <lb/>
in the Indian civil service was such that I was deemed <lb/>
peculiarly worthy of the honor of conveying the present <lb/>
to her Majesty. A ship was fitted out for me and my <lb/>
servants and the officers and attendants of the elephant, <lb/>
and in due time I arrived in New York harbor and <lb/>
placed my royal charge in admirable quarters in Jersey <lb/>
City. It was necessary to remain awhile in order to <lb/>
recruit the animal's health before resuming the voyage.</p>
<p>All went well during a fortnight&#x2014;then my calamities <lb/>
began. The white elephant was stolen! I was called <lb/>
up at dead of night and informed of this fearful mis- <lb/>
fortune. For some moments I was beside myself with <lb/>
terror and anxiety; I was helpless. Then I grew <lb/>
calmer and collected my faculties. I soon saw my <lb/>
course&#x2014;for, indeed, there was but the one course for <lb/>
an intelligent man to pursue. Late as it was, I flew to <lb/>
New York and got a policeman to conduct me to the <lb/>
headquarters of the detective force. Fortunately I <lb/>
arrived in time, though the chief of the force, the cele- <lb/>
brated Inspector Blunt, was just on the point of leaving <lb/>
for his home. He was a man of middle size and com- <lb/>
pact frame, and when he was thinking deeply he had a <lb/>
way of knitting his brows and tapping his forehead <lb/>
reflectively with his finger, which impressed you at <lb/>
once with the conviction that you stood in the presence <lb/>
of a person of no common order. The very sight of <lb/>
him gave me confidence and made me hopeful. I <lb/>
<pb n="231"/>
stated my errand. It did not flurry him in the least; <lb/>
it had no more visible effect upon his iron self- <lb/>
possession that if I had told him somebody had stolen <lb/>
my dog. He motioned me to a seat, and said, calmly:</p>
<p>"Allow me to think a moment, please."</p>
<p>So saying, he sat down at his office table and leaned <lb/>
his head upon his hand. Several clerks were at work <lb/>
at the other end of the room; the scratching of their <lb/>
pens was all the sound I heard during the next six or <lb/>
seven minutes. Meantime the inspector sat there, <lb/>
buried in thought. Finally he raised his head, and <lb/>
there was that in the firm lines of his face which <lb/>
showed me that his brain had done its work and his <lb/>
plan was made. Said he&#x2014;and his voice was low and <lb/>
impressive:</p>
<p>"This is no ordinary case. Every step must be <lb/>
warily taken; each step must be made sure before the <lb/>
next is ventured. And secrecy must be observed&#x2014; <lb/>
secrecy profound and absolute. Speak to no one <lb/>
about the matter, not even the reporters. I will take <lb/>
care of <i>them;</i> I will see that they get only what it may <lb/>
suit my ends to let them know." He touched a bell; <lb/>
a youth appeared. "Alaric, tell the reporters to re- <lb/>
main for the present." The boy retired. "Now let <lb/>
us proceed to business&#x2014;and systematically. Nothing <lb/>
can be accomplished in this trade of mine without strict <lb/>
and minute method."</p>
<p>He took a pen and some paper. "Now&#x2014;name of <lb/>
the elephant?"</p>
<p>"Hassan Ben Ali Ben Selim Abdallah Mohammed <lb/>
Mois&#x00E9; Alhammal Jamsetjejeebhoy Dhuleep Sultan Ebu <lb/>
Bhudpoor."</p>
<p>"Very well. Given name?"</p>
<p>"Jumbo."</p>
<p>"Very well. Place of birth?"</p>
<p>"The capital city of Siam."</p>
<pb n="232"/>
<p>"Parents living?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;dead."</p>
<p>"Had they any other issue beside this one?"</p>
<p>"None. He was an only child."</p>
<p>"Very well. These matters are sufficient under that <lb/>
head. Now please describe the elephant, and leave <lb/>
out no particular, however insignificant&#x2014;that is, insig- <lb/>
nificant from <i>your</i> point of view. To men in my pro- <lb/>
fession there <i>are</i> no insignificant particulars; they do <lb/>
not exist."</p>
<p>I described&#x2014;he wrote. When I was done, he <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Now listen. If I have made any mistakes, correct <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>He read as follows:</p>
<p>"Height, 19 feet; length from apex of forehead to <lb/>
insertion of tail, 26 feet; length of trunk, 16 feet; <lb/>
length of tail, 6 feet; total length, including trunk and <lb/>
tail, 48 feet; length of tusks, 9&#x00BD; feet; ears in keeping <lb/>
with these dimensions; footprint resembles the mark <lb/>
left when one up-ends a barrel in the snow; color of <lb/>
the elephant, a dull white; has a hole the size of a <lb/>
plate in each ear for the insertion of jewelry, and pos- <lb/>
sesses the habit in a remarkable degree of squirting <lb/>
water upon spectators and of maltreating with his trunk <lb/>
not only such persons as he is acquainted with, but <lb/>
even entire strangers; limps slightly with his right hind <lb/>
leg, and has a small scar in his left armpit caused by a <lb/>
former boil; had on, when stolen, a castle containing <lb/>
seats for fifteen persons, and a gold-cloth saddle- <lb/>
blanket the size of an ordinary carpet."</p>
<p>There were no mistakes. The inspector touched the <lb/>
bell, handed the description to Alaric, and said:</p>
<p>"Have fifty thousand copies of this printed at once <lb/>
and mailed to every detective office and pawnbroker's <lb/>
shop on the continent." Alaric retired. "There&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="233"/>
so far, so good. Next, I must have a photograph of <lb/>
the property."</p>
<p>I gave him one. He examined it critically, and said:</p>
<p>"It must do, since we can do no better; but he has <lb/>
his trunk curled up and tucked into his mouth. That <lb/>
is unfortunate, and is calculated to mislead, for of <lb/>
course he does not usually have it in that position." <lb/>
He touched his bell.</p>
<p>"Alaric, have fifty thousand copies of this photo- <lb/>
graph made the first thing in the morning, and mail <lb/>
them with the descriptive circulars."</p>
<p>Alaric retired to execute his orders. The inspector <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"It will be necessary to offer a reward, of course. <lb/>
Now as to the amount?"</p>
<p>"What sum would you suggest?"</p>
<p>"To <i>begin</i> with, I should say&#x2014;well, twenty-five <lb/>
thousand dollars. It is an intricate and difficult busi- <lb/>
ness; there are a thousand avenues of escape and op- <lb/>
portunities of concealment. These thieves have friends <lb/>
and pals everywhere&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Bless me, do you know who they are?"</p>
<p>The wary face, practiced in concealing the thoughts <lb/>
and feelings within, gave me no token, nor yet the <lb/>
replying words, so quietly uttered:</p>
<p>"Never mind about that. I may, and I may not. <lb/>
We generally gather a pretty shrewd inkling of who <lb/>
our man is by the manner of his work and the size of <lb/>
the game he goes after. We are not dealing with a <lb/>
pickpocket or a hall thief now, make up your mind to <lb/>
that. This property was not 'lifted' by a novice. <lb/>
But, as I was saying, considering the amount of travel <lb/>
which will have to be done, and the diligence with <lb/>
which the thieves will cover up their traces as they move <lb/>
along, twenty-five thousand may be too small a sum <lb/>
to offer, yet I think it worth while to start with that."</p>
<pb n="234"/>
<p>So we determined upon that figure as a beginning. <lb/>
Then this man, whom nothing escaped which could by <lb/>
any possibility be made to serve as a clew, said:</p>
<p>"There are cases in detective history to show that <lb/>
criminals have been detected through peculiarities in <lb/>
their appetites. Now, what does this elephant eat, and <lb/>
how much?"</p>
<p>"Well, as to <i>what</i> he eats&#x2014;he will eat <i>anything</i>. <lb/>
He will eat a man, he will eat a Bible&#x2014;he will eat <lb/>
anything <i>between</i> a man and a Bible."</p>
<p>"Good&#x2014;very good, indeed, but too general. De- <lb/>
tails are necessary&#x2014;details are the only valuable things <lb/>
in our trade. Very well&#x2014;as to men. At one meal&#x2014; <lb/>
or, if you prefer, during one day&#x2014;how many men <lb/>
will he eat, if fresh?"</p>
<p>"He would not care whether they were fresh or <lb/>
not; at a single meal he would eat five ordinary men."</p>
<p>"Very good; five men; we will put that down. <lb/>
What nationalities would he prefer?"</p>
<p>"He is indifferent about nationalities. He prefers <lb/>
acquaintances, but is not prejudiced against strangers."</p>
<p>"Very good. Now, as to Bibles. How many Bibles <lb/>
would he eat at a meal?"</p>
<p>"He would eat an entire edition."</p>
<p>"It is hardly succinct enough. Do you mean the <lb/>
ordinary octavo, or the family illustrated?"</p>
<p>"I think he would be indifferent to illustrations; <lb/>
that is, I think he would not value illustrations above <lb/>
simple letter-press."</p>
<p>"No, you do not get my idea. I refer to bulk. <lb/>
The ordinary octavo Bible weighs about two pounds <lb/>
and a half, while the great quarto with the illustrations <lb/>
weighs ten or twelve. How many Dor&#x00E9; Bibles would <lb/>
he eat at a meal?"</p>
<p>"If you knew this elephant, you could not ask. He <lb/>
would take what they had."</p>
<pb n="235"/>
<p>"Well, put it in dollars and cents, then. We must <lb/>
get at it somehow. The Dor&#x00E9; costs a hundred dollars <lb/>
a copy, Russia leather, beveled."</p>
<p>"He would require about fifty thousand dollars' <lb/>
worth&#x2014;say an edition of five hundred copies."</p>
<p>"Now that is more exact. I will put that down. <lb/>
Very well; he likes men and Bibles; so far, so good. <lb/>
What else will he eat? I want particulars."</p>
<p>"He will leave Bibles to eat bricks, he will leave <lb/>
bricks to eat bottles, he will leave bottles to eat <lb/>
clothing, he will leave clothing to eat cats, he will <lb/>
leave cats to eat oysters, he will leave oysters to eat <lb/>
ham, he will leave ham to eat sugar, he will leave sugar <lb/>
to eat pie, he will leave pie to eat potatoes, he will <lb/>
leave potatoes to eat bran, he will leave bran to eat hay, <lb/>
he will leave hay to eat oats, he will leave oats to eat <lb/>
rice, for he was mainly raised on it. There is nothing <lb/>
whatever that he will not eat but European butter, and <lb/>
he would eat that if he could taste it."</p>
<p>"Very good. General quantity at a meal&#x2014;say <lb/>
about&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, anywhere from a quarter to half a ton."</p>
<p>"And he drinks&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Everything that is fluid. Milk, water, whisky, <lb/>
molasses, castor oil, camphene, carbolic acid&#x2014;it is <lb/>
no use to go into particulars; whatever fluid occurs to <lb/>
you set it down. He will drink anything that is fluid, <lb/>
except European coffee."</p>
<p>"Very good. As to quantity?"</p>
<p>"Put it down five to fifteen barrels&#x2014;his thirst <lb/>
varies; his other appetites do not."</p>
<p>"These things are unusual. They ought to furnish <lb/>
quite good clews toward tracing him."</p>
<p>He touched the bell.</p>
<p>"Alaric, summon Captain Burns."</p>
<p>Burns appeared. Inspector Blunt unfolded the whole <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
matter to him, detail by detail. Then he said in the <lb/>
clear, decisive tones of a man whose plans are clearly <lb/>
defined in his head, and who is accustomed to com- <lb/>
mand:</p>
<p>"Captain Burns, detail Detectives Jones, Davis, <lb/>
Halsey, Bates, and Hackett to shadow the elephant."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Detail Detectives Moses, Dakin, Murphy, Rogers, <lb/>
Tupper, Higgins, and Bartholomew to shadow the <lb/>
thieves."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Place a strong guard&#x2014;a guard of thirty picked <lb/>
men, with a relief of thirty&#x2014;over the place from <lb/>
whence the elephant was stolen, to keep strict watch <lb/>
there night and day, and allow none to approach&#x2014; <lb/>
except reporters&#x2014;without written authority from me."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Place detectives in plain clothes in the railway, <lb/>
steamship, and ferry depots, and upon all roadways <lb/>
leading out of Jersey City, with orders to search all <lb/>
suspicious persons."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Furnish all these men with photograph and accom- <lb/>
panying description of the elephant, and instruct them <lb/>
to search all trains and outgoing ferry-boats and other <lb/>
vessels."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"If the elephant should be found, let him be seized, <lb/>
and the information forwarded to me by telegraph."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Let me be informed at once if any clews should be <lb/>
found&#x2014;footprints of the animal, or anything of that <lb/>
kind."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Get an order commanding the harbor police to <lb/>
patrol the frontages vigilantly."</p>
<pb n="237"/>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Despatch detectives in plain clothes over all the <lb/>
railways, north as far as Canada, west as far as Ohio, <lb/>
south as far as Washington."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Place experts in all the telegraph offices to listen <lb/>
to all messages; and let them require that all cipher <lb/>
dispatches be interpreted to them."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Let all these things be done with the utmost <lb/>
secrecy&#x2014;mind, the most impenetrable secrecy."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Report to me promptly at the usual hour."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Go!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>He was gone.</p>
<p>Inspector Blunt was silent and thoughtful a moment, <lb/>
while the fire in his eye cooled down and faded out. <lb/>
Then he turned to me and said in a placid voice:</p>
<p>"I am not given to boasting, it is not my habit; <lb/>
but&#x2014;we shall find the elephant."</p>
<p>I shook him warmly by the hand and thanked him; <lb/>
and I <i>felt</i> my thanks, too. The more I had seen of <lb/>
the man the more I liked him and the more I admired <lb/>
him and marveled over the mysterious wonders of his <lb/>
profession. Then we parted for the night, and I went <lb/>
home with a far happier heart than I had carried with <lb/>
me to his office.</p>

<head><b>II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Next</smcap> morning it was all in the newspapers, in the <lb/>
minutest detail. It even had additions&#x2014;consisting <lb/>
of Detective This, Detective That, and Detective <lb/>
The Other's "Theory" as to how the robbery was <lb/>
done, who the robbers were, and whither they had <lb/>
flown with their booty. There were eleven of these <lb/>
theories, and they covered all the possibilities; and <lb/>
this single fact shows what independent thinkers detect- <lb/>
ives are. No two theories were alike, or even much <lb/>
resembled each other, save in one striking particular, <lb/>
and in that one all the other eleven theories were abso- <lb/>
lutely agreed. That was, that although the rear of my <lb/>
building was torn out and the only door remained <lb/>
locked, the elephant had not been removed through the <lb/>
rent, but by some other (undiscovered) outlet. All <lb/>
agreed that the robbers had made that rent only to <lb/>
mislead the detectives. That never would have oc- <lb/>
curred to me or to any other layman, perhaps, but it <lb/>
had not deceived the detectives for a moment. Thus, <lb/>
what I had supposed was the only thing that had no <lb/>
mystery about it was in fact the very thing I had gone <lb/>
furthest astray in. The eleven theories all named the <lb/>
supposed robbers, but no two named the same robbers; <lb/>
the total number of suspected persons was thirty-seven. <lb/>
The various newspaper accounts all closed with the <lb/>
most important opinion of all&#x2014;that of Chief Inspector <lb/>
Blunt. A portion of this statement read as follows: <lb/>
<q>"The chief knows who the two principals are, namely, 'Brick' Duffy <lb/>
and 'Red' McFadden. Ten days before the robbery was achieved he was <lb/>
already aware that it was to be attempted, and had quietly proceeded to <lb/>
shadow these two noted villains; but unfortunately on the night in ques- <lb/>
<pb n="239"/>
tion their track was lost, and before it could be found again the <lb/>
bird was flown&#x2014;that is, the elephant.</q>
<q>"Duffy and McFadden are the boldest scoundrels in the pro- <lb/>
fession; the chief has reasons for believing that they are the men <lb/>
who stole the stove out of the detective headquarters on a bitter <lb/>
night last winter&#x2014;in consequence of which the chief and every <lb/>
detective present were in the hands of the physicians before morn- <lb/>
ing, some with frozen feet, others with frozen fingers, ears, and <lb/>
other members."</q></p>
<p>When I read the first half of that I was more aston- <lb/>
ished than ever at the wonderful sagacity of this strange <lb/>
man. He not only saw everything in the present with <lb/>
a clear eye, but even the future could not be hidden <lb/>
from him. I was soon at his office, and said I could <lb/>
not help wishing he had had those men arrested, and <lb/>
so prevented the trouble and loss; but his reply was <lb/>
simple and unanswerable:</p>
<p>"It is not our province to prevent crime, but to <lb/>
punish it. We cannot punish it until it is com- <lb/>
mitted."</p>
<p>I remarked that the secrecy with which we had begun <lb/>
had been marred by the newspapers; not only all our <lb/>
facts but all our plans and purposes had been revealed; <lb/>
even all the suspected persons had been named; these <lb/>
would doubtless disguise themselves now, or go into <lb/>
hiding.</p>
<p>"Let them. They will find that when I am ready <lb/>
for them my hand will descend upon them, in their <lb/>
secret places, as unerringly as the hand of fate. As to <lb/>
the newspapers, we <i>must</i> keep in with them. Fame, <lb/>
reputation, constant public mention&#x2014;these are the <lb/>
detective's bread and butter. He must publish his <lb/>
facts, else he will be supposed to have none; he must <lb/>
publish his theory, for nothing is so strange or striking <lb/>
as a detective's theory, or brings him so much wonder- <lb/>
ing respect; we must publish our plans, for these the <lb/>
journals insist upon having, and we could not deny <lb/>
<pb n="240"/>
them without offending. We must constantly show the <lb/>
public what we are doing, or they will believe we are <lb/>
doing nothing. It is much pleasanter to have a news- <lb/>
paper say, 'Inspector Blunt's ingenious and extraordi- <lb/>
nary theory is as follows,' than to have it say some <lb/>
harsh thing, or, worse still, some sarcastic one."</p>
<p>"I see the force of what you say. But I noticed <lb/>
that in one part of your remarks in the papers this <lb/>
morning you refused to reveal your opinion upon a <lb/>
certain minor point."</p>
<p>"Yes, we always do that; it has a good effect. <lb/>
Besides, I had not formed any opinion on that point, <lb/>
anyway."</p>
<p>I deposited a considerable sum of money with the <lb/>
inspector, to meet current expenses, and sat down to <lb/>
wait for news. We were expecting the telegrams to <lb/>
begin to arrive at any moment now. Meantime I re- <lb/>
read the newspapers and also our descriptive circular, <lb/>
and observed that our &#x0024;25,000 reward seemed to be <lb/>
offered only to detectives. I said I thought it ought to <lb/>
be offered to anybody who would catch the elephant. <lb/>
The inspector said:</p>
<p>"It is the detectives who will find the elephant, hence <lb/>
the reward will go to the right place. If other people <lb/>
found the animal, it would only be by watching the <lb/>
detectives and taking advantage of clews and indications <lb/>
stolen from them, and that would entitle the detectives <lb/>
to the reward, after all. The proper office of a reward <lb/>
is to stimulate the men who deliver up their time and <lb/>
their trained sagacities to this sort of work, and not to <lb/>
confer benefits upon chance citizens who stumble upon <lb/>
a capture without having earned the benefits by their <lb/>
own merits and labors."</p>
<p>This was reasonable enough, certainly. Now the <lb/>
telegraphic machine in the corner began to click, and <lb/>
the following dispatch was the result:</p>

<p>Elephant arrived here from the south and passed through toward the <lb/>
forest at 11.50, dispersing a funeral on the way, and diminishing the mourn- <lb/>
ers by two. Citizens fired some small cannon-balls into him, and then fled. <lb/>
Detective Burke and I arrived ten minutes later, from the north, but mis- <lb/>
took some excavations for footprints, and so lost a good deal of time; but <lb/>
at last we struck the right trail and followed it to the woods. We then got <lb/>
down on our hands and knees and continued to keep a sharp eye on the <lb/>
track, and so shadowed it into the brush. Burke was in advance. Unfor- <lb/>
tunately the animal had stopped to rest; therefore, Burke having his head <lb/>
down, intent upon the track, butted up against the elephant's hind legs <lb/>
before he was aware of his vicinity. Burke instantly arose to his feet, <lb/>
seized the tail, and exclaimed joyfully, "I claim the re&#x2014;" but got no fur- <lb/>
ther, for a single blow of the huge trunk laid the brave fellow's fragments <lb/>
low in death. I fled rearward, and the elephant turned and shadowed me <lb/>
to the edge of the wood, making tremendous speed, and I should inevitably <lb/>
have been lost, but that the remains of the funeral providentially intervened <lb/>
again and diverted his attention. I have just learned that nothing of that <lb/>
funeral is now left; but this is no loss, for there is abundance of material <lb/>
for another. Meantime, the elephant has disappeared again.</p>

<p><smcap>Next</smcap> morning the papers were as full of detective <lb/>
theories as before; they had all our tragic facts <lb/>
in detail also, and a great many more which they <lb/>
had received from their telegraphic correspondents. <lb/>
Column after column was occupied, a third of its way <lb/>
down, with glaring head-lines, which it made my heart <lb/>
sick to read. Their general tone was like this: <lb/>
<q><smcap>"The White Elephant at Large! He moves upon his Fatal <lb/>
March! Whole Villages deserted by their Fright-stricken <lb/>
Occupants! Pale Terror goes before Him, Death and Devasta- <lb/>
tion follow after! After these, the Detectives! Barns de- <lb/>
stroyed, Factories gutted, Harvests devoured, Public Assemblages <lb/>
dispersed, accompanied by Scenes of Carnage impossible to de- <lb/>
scribe! Theories of thirty-four of the most distinguished De- <lb/>
tectives on the Force! Theory of Chief Blunt!"</smcap></q></p>
<p>"There!" said Inspector Blunt, almost betrayed <lb/>
into excitement, "this is magnificent! This is the <lb/>
<pb n="247"/>
greatest windfall that any detective organization ever <lb/>
had. The fame of it will travel to the ends of the <lb/>
earth, and endure to the end of time, and my name <lb/>
with it."</p>
<p>But there was no joy for me. I felt as if I had com- <lb/>
mitted all those red crimes, and that the elephant was <lb/>
only my irresponsible agent. And how the list had <lb/>
grown! In one place he had "interfered with an <lb/>
election and killed five repeaters." He had followed <lb/>
this act with the destruction of two poor fellows, <lb/>
named O'Donohue and McFlannigan, who had "found <lb/>
a refuge in the home of the oppressed of all lands only <lb/>
the day before, and were in the act of exercising for <lb/>
the first time the noble right of American citizens at <lb/>
the polls, when stricken down by the relentless hand of <lb/>
the Scourge of Siam." In another, he had "found a <lb/>
crazy sensation-preacher preparing his next season's <lb/>
heroic attacks on the dance, the theater, and other <lb/>
things which can't strike back, and had stepped on <lb/>
him." And in still another place he had "killed a <lb/>
lightning-rod agent." And so the list went on, grow- <lb/>
ing redder and redder, and more and more heart- <lb/>
breaking. Sixty persons had been killed, and two <lb/>
hundred and forty wounded. All the accounts bore <lb/>
just testimony to the activity and devotion of the de- <lb/>
tectives, and all closed with the remark that "three <lb/>
hundred thousand citizens and four detectives saw the <lb/>
dread creature, and two of the latter he destroyed."</p>
<p>I dreaded to hear the telegraphic instrument begin <lb/>
to click again. By and by the messages began to pour <lb/>
in, but I was happily disappointed in their nature. It <lb/>
was soon apparent that all trace of the elephant was <lb/>
lost. The fog had enabled him to search out a good <lb/>
hiding-place unobserved. Telegrams from the most <lb/>
absurdly distant points reported that a dim vast mass <lb/>
had been glimpsed there through the fog at such and <lb/>
<pb n="248"/>
such an hour, and was "undoubtedly the elephant." <lb/>
This dim vast mass had been glimpsed in New Haven, <lb/>
in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania, in interior New York, <lb/>
in Brooklyn, and even in the city of New York itself! <lb/>
But in all cases the dim vast mass had vanished quickly <lb/>
and left no trace. Every detective of the large force <lb/>
scattered over this huge extent of country sent his <lb/>
hourly report, and each and every one of them had a <lb/>
clew, and was shadowing something, and was hot upon <lb/>
the heels of it.</p>
<p>But the day passed without other result.</p>
<p>The next day the same.</p>
<p>The next just the same.</p>
<p>The newspaper reports began to grow monotonous <lb/>
with facts that amounted to nothing, clews which led <lb/>
to nothing, and theories which had nearly exhausted <lb/>
the elements which surprise and delight and dazzle.</p>
<p>By advice of the inspector I doubled the reward.</p>
<p>Four more dull days followed. Then came a bitter <lb/>
blow to the poor, hardworking detectives&#x2014;the jour- <lb/>
nalists declined to print their theories, and coldly said, <lb/>
"Give us a rest."</p>
<p>Two weeks after the elephant's disappearance I <lb/>
raised the reward to &#x0024;75,000 by the inspector's ad- <lb/>
vice. It was a great sum, but I felt that I would rather <lb/>
sacrifice my whole private fortune than lose my credit <lb/>
with my government. Now that the detectives were in <lb/>
adversity, the newspapers turned upon them, and began <lb/>
to fling the most stinging sarcasms at them. This gave <lb/>
the minstrels an idea, and they dressed themselves as <lb/>
detectives and hunted the elephant on the stage in the <lb/>
most extravagant way. The caricaturists made pictures <lb/>
of detectives scanning the country with spy glasses, <lb/>
while the elephant, at their backs, stole apples out of <lb/>
their pockets. And they made all sorts of ridiculous <lb/>
pictures of the detective badge&#x2014;you have seen that <lb/>
<pb n="249"/>
badge printed in gold on the back of detective novels, <lb/>
no doubt&#x2014;it is a wide-staring eye, with the legend, <lb/>
"<smcap>We Never Sleep</smcap>." When detectives called for a <lb/>
drink, the would-be facetious barkeeper resurrected an <lb/>
obsolete form of expression and said, "Will you have <lb/>
an eye-opener?" All the air was thick with sar- <lb/>
casms.</p>
<p>But there was one man who moved calm, untouched, <lb/>
unaffected, through it all. It was that heart of oak, <lb/>
the chief inspector. His brave eye never drooped, his <lb/>
serene confidence never wavered. He always said:</p>
<p>"Let them rail on; he laughs best who laughs <lb/>
last."</p>
<p>My admiration for the man grew into a species of <lb/>
worship. I was at his side always. His office had be- <lb/>
come an unpleasant place to me, and now became daily <lb/>
more and more so. Yet if he could endure it I meant <lb/>
to do so also&#x2014;at least, as long as I could. So I <lb/>
came regularly, and stayed&#x2014;the only outsider who <lb/>
seemed to be capable of it. Everybody wondered how <lb/>
I could; and often it seemed to me that I must desert, <lb/>
but at such times I looked into that calm and apparently <lb/>
unconscious face, and held my ground.</p>
<p>About three weeks after the elephant's disappearance <lb/>
I was about to say, one morning, that I should <i>have</i> to <lb/>
strike my colors and retire, when the great detective <lb/>
arrested the thought by proposing one more superb <lb/>
and masterly move.</p>
<p>This was to compromise with the robbers. The <lb/>
fertility of this man's invention exceeded anything I <lb/>
have ever seen, and I have had a wide intercourse with <lb/>
the world's finest minds. He said he was confident he <lb/>
could compromise for &#x0024;100,000 and recover the ele- <lb/>
phant. I said I believed I could scrape the amount <lb/>
together, but what would become of the poor detec- <lb/>
tives who had worked so faithfully? He said:</p>
<pb n="250"/>
<p>"In compromises they always get half."</p>
<p>This removed my only objection. So the inspector <lb/>
wrote two notes, in this form:</p>
<quotedLetter>
<p><smcap>Dear Madam</smcap>,&#x2014;Your husband can make a large sum of money (and <lb/>
be entirely protected from the law) by making an immediate appointment <lb/>
with me.</p>

</closer>
</quotedLetter>
<p>He sent one of these by his confidential messenger <lb/>
to the "reputed wife" of Brick Duffy, and the other <lb/>
to the reputed wife of Red McFadden.</p>
<p>Within the hour these offensive answers came:</p>

</quotedLetter>
<p>"I had long suspected these facts," said the in- <lb/>
spector; "this testimony proves the unerring accuracy <lb/>
of my instinct."</p>
<p>The moment one resource failed him he was ready <lb/>
with another. He immediately wrote an advertisement <lb/>
for the morning papers, and I kept a copy of it: <lb/>
<q>A.&#x2014;xwblv. 242 N. Tjnd&#x2014;fz328wmlg. Ozpo,&#x2014;; 2 m! ogw. Mum.</q></p>
<p>He said that if the thief was alive this would bring <lb/>
him to the usual rendezvous. He further explained <lb/>
that the usual rendezvous was a place where all busi- <lb/>
ness affairs between detectives and criminals were con- <lb/>
ducted. This meeting would take place at twelve the <lb/>
next night.</p>
<p>We could do nothing till then, and I lost no time in <lb/>
getting out of the office, and was grateful indeed for <lb/>
the privilege.</p>
<p>At 11 the next night I brought &#x0024;100,000 in bank <lb/>
<pb n="251"/>
notes and put them into the chief's hands, and shortly <lb/>
afterward he took his leave, with the brave old un- <lb/>
dimmed confidence in his eye. An almost intolerable <lb/>
hour dragged to a close; then I heard his welcome <lb/>
tread, and rose gasping and tottered to meet him. <lb/>
How his fine eyes flamed with triumph! He said:</p>
<p>"We've compromised! The jokers will sing a dif- <lb/>
ferent tune to-morrow! Follow me!"</p>
<p>He took a lighted candle and strode down into the <lb/>
vast vaulted basement where sixty detectives always <lb/>
slept, and where a score were now playing cards to <lb/>
while the time. I followed close after him. He <lb/>
walked swiftly down to the dim and remote end of the <lb/>
place, and just as I succumbed to the pangs of suffoca- <lb/>
tion and was swooning away he stumbled and fell over <lb/>
the outlying members of a mighty object, and I heard <lb/>
him exclaim as he went down:</p>
<p>"Our noble profession is vindicated. Here is your <lb/>
elephant!"</p>
<p>I was carried to the office above and restored with <lb/>
carbolic acid. The whole detective force swarmed in, <lb/>
and such another season of triumphant rejoicing ensued <lb/>
as I had never witnessed before. The reporters were <lb/>
called, baskets of champagne were opened, toasts were <lb/>
drunk, the handshakings and congratulations were con- <lb/>
tinuous and enthusiastic. Naturally the chief was the <lb/>
hero of the hour, and his happiness was so complete <lb/>
and had been so patiently and worthily and bravely <lb/>
won that it made me happy to see it, though I stood <lb/>
there a homeless beggar, my priceless charge dead, <lb/>
and my position in my country's service lost to me <lb/>
through what would always seem my fatally careless <lb/>
execution of a great trust. Many an eloquent eye <lb/>
testified its deep admiration for the chief, and many a <lb/>
detective's voice murmured, "Look at him&#x2014;just the <lb/>
king of the profession; only give him a clew, it's all <lb/>
<pb n="252"/>
he wants, and there ain't anything hid that he can't <lb/>
find." The dividing of the &#x0024;50,000 made great pleas- <lb/>
ure; when it was finished the chief made a little speech <lb/>
while he put his share in his pocket, in which he said, <lb/>
"Enjoy it, boys, for you've earned it; and more than <lb/>
that you've earned for the detective profession undying <lb/>
fame."</p>
<p>A telegram arrived, which read:</p>

<p>First time I've struck a telegraph office in over three weeks. Have <lb/>
followed those footprints, horseback, through the woods, a thousand miles <lb/>
to here, and they get stronger and bigger and fresher every day. Don't <lb/>
worry&#x2014;inside of another week I'll have the elephant. This is dead sure.</p>

<signed><smcap>Darley</smcap>, <i>Detective</i>.</signed>
</closer>
</quotedLetter>
<p>The chief ordered three cheers for "Darley, one of <lb/>
the finest minds on the force," and then commanded <lb/>
that he be telegraphed to come home and receive his <lb/>
share of the reward.</p>
<p>So ended that marvelous episode of the stolen ele- <lb/>
phant. The newspapers were pleasant with praises <lb/>
once more, the next day, with one contemptible excep- <lb/>
tion. This sheet said, "Great is the detective! He <lb/>
may be a little slow in finding a little thing like a mis- <lb/>
laid elephant&#x2014;he may hunt him all day and sleep <lb/>
with his rotting carcass all night for three weeks, but <lb/>
he will find him at last&#x2014;if he can get the man who <lb/>
mislaid him to show him the place!"</p>
<p>Poor Hassan was lost to me forever. The cannon- <lb/>
shots had wounded him fatally, he had crept to that <lb/>
unfriendly place in the fog, and there, surrounded by <lb/>
his enemies and in constant danger of detection, he had <lb/>
wasted away with hunger and suffering till death gave <lb/>
him peace.</p>
<p>The compromise cost me &#x0024;100,000; my detective <lb/>
expenses were &#x0024;42,000 more; I never applied for a <lb/>
<pb n="253"/>
place again under my government; I am a ruined man <lb/>
and a wanderer in the earth&#x2014;but my admiration for <lb/>
that man, whom I believe to be the greatest detective <lb/>
the world has ever produced, remains undimmed to this <lb/>
day, and will so remain unto the end.</p>

<head><b>SOME RAMBLING NOTES OF AN IDLE <lb/>
EXCURSION</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<div2 type="chapter" n="I">
<head><b>I.</b></head>
<p><smcap>All</smcap> the journeyings I had ever done had been <lb/>
purely in the way of business. The pleasant May <lb/>
weather suggested a novelty&#x2014;namely, a trip for pure <lb/>
recreation, the bread-and-butter element left out. The <lb/>
Reverend said he would go, too; a good man, one of <lb/>
the best of men, although a clergyman. By eleven at <lb/>
night we were in New Haven and on board the New <lb/>
York boat. We bought our tickets, and then went <lb/>
wandering around here and there, in the solid comfort <lb/>
of being free and idle, and of putting distance between <lb/>
ourselves and the mails and telegraphs.</p>
<p>After a while I went to my stateroom and undressed, <lb/>
but the night was too enticing for bed. We were <lb/>
moving down the bay now, and it was pleasant to stand <lb/>
at the window and take the cool night breeze and watch <lb/>
the gliding lights on shore. Presently, two elderly men <lb/>
sat down under that window and began a conversation. <lb/>
Their talk was properly no business of mine, yet I was <lb/>
feeling friendly toward the world and willing to be <lb/>
entertained. I soon gathered that they were brothers, <lb/>
that they were from a small Connecticut village, and <lb/>
that the matter in hand concerned the cemetery. Said <lb/>
one:</p>
<pb n="255"/>
<p>"Now, John, we talked it all over amongst ourselves, <lb/>
and this is what we've done. You see, everybody was <lb/>
a-movin' from the old buryin' ground, and our folks <lb/>
was 'most about left to theirselves, as you may say. <lb/>
They was crowded, too, as you know; lot wa'n't big <lb/>
enough in the first place; and last year, when Seth's <lb/>
wife died, we couldn't hardly tuck her in. She sort o' <lb/>
overlaid Deacon Shorb's lot, and he soured on her, so <lb/>
to speak, and on the rest of us, too. So we talked it <lb/>
over, and I was for a lay-out in the new simitery on <lb/>
the hill. They wa'n't unwilling, if it was cheap. <lb/>
Well, the two best and biggest plots was No. 8 and <lb/>
No. 9&#x2014;both of a size; nice comfortable room for <lb/>
twenty-six&#x2014;twenty-six full-growns, that is; but you <lb/>
reckon in children and other shorts, and strike an <lb/>
everage, and I should say you might lay in thirty, or <lb/>
may be thirty-two or three, pretty genteel&#x2014;no crowd- <lb/>
in' to signify."</p>
<p>"That's a plenty, William. Which one did you <lb/>
buy?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'm a-comin' to that, John. You see, No. <lb/>
8 was thirteen dollars, No. 9 fourteen&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I see. So's't you took No. 8."</p>
<p>"You wait. I took No. 9. And I'll tell you for <lb/>
why. In the first place, Deacon Shorb wanted it. <lb/>
Well, after the way he'd gone on about Seth's wife <lb/>
overlappin' his prem'ses, I'd 'a' beat him out of that <lb/>
No. 9 if I'd 'a' had to stand two dollars extra, let <lb/>
alone one. That's the way I felt about it. Says I, <lb/>
what's a dollar, anyway? Life's on'y a pilgrimage, <lb/>
says I; we ain't here for good, and we can't take it <lb/>
with us, says I. So I just dumped it down, knowin' <lb/>
the Lord don't suffer a good deed to go for nothin', <lb/>
and cal'latin' to take it out o' somebody in the course <lb/>
o' trade. Then there was another reason, John. No. <lb/>
9's a long way the handiest lot in the simitery, and the <lb/>
<pb n="256"/>
likeliest for situation. It lays right on top of a knoll <lb/>
in the dead center of the buryin' ground; and you can <lb/>
see Millport from there, and Tracy's, and Hopper <lb/>
Mount, and a raft o' farms, and so on. There ain't <lb/>
no better outlook from a buryin' plot in the State. Si <lb/>
Higgins says so, and I reckon he ought to know. <lb/>
Well, and that ain't all. 'Course Shorb had to take <lb/>
No. 8; wa'n't no help for 't. Now, No. 8 jines on to <lb/>
No. 9, but it's on the slope of the hill, and every time <lb/>
it rains it'll soak right down on to the Shorbs. Si <lb/>
Higgins says 't when the deacon's time comes, he <lb/>
better take out fire and marine insurance both on his <lb/>
remains."</p>
<p>Here there was the sound of a low, placid, duplicate <lb/>
chuckle of appreciation and satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Now, John, here's a little rough draught of the <lb/>
ground that I've made on a piece of paper. Up here <lb/>
in the left-hand corner we've bunched the departed; <lb/>
took them from the old graveyard and stowed them <lb/>
one along side o' t'other, on a first-come-first-served <lb/>
plan, no partialities, with Gran'ther Jones for a starter, <lb/>
on'y because it happened so, and windin' up indis- <lb/>
criminate with Seth's twins. A little crowded towards <lb/>
the end of the lay-out, may be, but we reckoned <lb/>
'twa'n't best to scatter the twins. Well, next comes <lb/>
the livin'. Here, where it's marked A, we're goin' to <lb/>
put Mariar and her family, when they're called; B, <lb/>
that's for Brother Hosea and hisn; C, Calvin and <lb/>
tribe. What's left is these two lots here&#x2014;just the <lb/>
gem of the whole patch for general style and outlook; <lb/>
they're for me and my folks, and you and yourn. <lb/>
Which of them would you ruther be buried in?"</p>
<p>"I swan, you've took me mighty unexpected, <lb/>
William! It sort of started the shivers. Fact is, I was <lb/>
thinkin' so busy about makin' things comfortable for the <lb/>
others, I hadn't thought about being buried myself."</p>
<pb n="257"/>
<p>"Life's on'y a fleetin' show, John, as the sayin' is. <lb/>
We've all got to go, sooner or later. To go with a <lb/>
clean record's the main thing. Fact is, it's the on'y <lb/>
thing worth strivin' for, John."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's so, William, that's so; there ain't no <lb/>
getting around it. Which of these lots would you <lb/>
recommend?"</p>
<p>"Well, it depends, John. Are you particular about <lb/>
outlook?"</p>
<p>"I don't say I am, William, I don't say I ain't. <lb/>
Reely, I don't know. But mainly, I reckon, I'd set <lb/>
store by a south exposure."</p>
<p>"That's easy fixed, John. They're both south ex- <lb/>
posure. They take the sun, and the Shorbs get the <lb/>
shade."</p>
<p>"How about sile, William?"</p>
<p>"D's a sandy sile, E's mostly loom."</p>
<p>"You may gimme E, then, William; a sandy sile <lb/>
caves in, more or less, and costs for repairs."</p>
<p>"All right, set your name down here, John, under <lb/>
E. Now, if you don't mind payin' me your share of <lb/>
the fourteen dollars, John, while we're on the business, <lb/>
everything's fixed."</p>
<p>After some higgling and sharp bargaining the money <lb/>
was paid, and John bade his brother good night and <lb/>
took his leave. There was silence for some moments; <lb/>
then a soft chuckle welled up from the lonely William, <lb/>
and he muttered: "I declare for 't, if I haven't made <lb/>
a mistake! It's D that's mostly loom, not E. And <lb/>
John's booked for a sandy sile, after all."</p>
<p>There was another soft chuckle, and William de- <lb/>
parted to his rest also.</p>
<p>The next day, in New York, was a hot one. Still we <lb/>
managed to get more or less entertainment out of it. <lb/>
Toward the middle of the afternoon we arrived on <lb/>
board the stanch steamship <i>Bermuda</i>, with bag and bag- <lb/>
<pb n="258"/>
gage, and hunted for a shady place. It was blazing <lb/>
summer weather, until we were half way down the <lb/>
harbor. Then I buttoned my coat closely; half an <lb/>
hour later I put on a spring overcoat and buttoned <lb/>
that. As we passed the lightship I added an ulster <lb/>
and tied a handkerchief around the collar to hold it <lb/>
snug to my neck. So rapidly had the summer gone <lb/>
and winter come again!</p>
<p>By nightfall we were far out at sea, with no land in <lb/>
sight. No telegrams could come here, no letters, no <lb/>
news. This was an uplifting thought. It was still <lb/>
more uplifting to reflect that the millions of harassed <lb/>
people on shore behind us were suffering just as usual.</p>
<p>The next day brought us into the midst of the <lb/>
Atlantic solitudes&#x2014;out of smoke-colored soundings <lb/>
into fathomless deep blue; no ships visible anywhere <lb/>
over the wide ocean; no company but Mother Cary's <lb/>
chickens wheeling, darting, skimming the waves in the <lb/>
sun. There were some seafaring men among the pas- <lb/>
sengers, and conversation drifted into matters concern- <lb/>
ing ships and sailors. One said that "true as the <lb/>
needle to the pole" was a bad figure, since the needle <lb/>
seldom pointed to the pole. He said a ship's compass <lb/>
was not faithful to any particular point, but was the <lb/>
most fickle and treacherous of the servants of man. It <lb/>
was forever changing. It changed every day in the <lb/>
year; consequently the amount of the daily variation <lb/>
had to be ciphered out and allowance made for it, else <lb/>
the mariner would go utterly astray. Another said <lb/>
there was a vast fortune waiting for the genius who <lb/>
should invent a compass that would not be affected by <lb/>
the local influences of an iron ship. He said there was <lb/>
only one creature more fickle than a wooden ship's <lb/>
compass, and that was the compass of an iron ship. <lb/>
Then came reference to the well-known fact that an <lb/>
experienced mariner can look at the compass of a new <lb/>
<pb n="259"/>
iron vessel, thousands of miles from her birthplace, and <lb/>
tell which way her head was pointing when she was in <lb/>
process of building.</p>
<p>Now an ancient whale-ship master fell to talking <lb/>
about the sort of crews they used to have in his early <lb/>
days. Said he:</p>
<p>"Sometimes we'd have a batch of college students. <lb/>
Queer lot. Ignorant? Why, they didn't know the <lb/>
catheads from the main brace. But if you took them <lb/>
for fools you'd get bit, sure. They'd learn more in a <lb/>
month than another man would in a year. We had <lb/>
one, once, in the <i>Mary Ann</i>, that came aboard with <lb/>
gold spectacles on. And besides, he was rigged out <lb/>
from main truck to keelson in the nobbiest clothes that <lb/>
ever saw a fo'castle. He had a chest full, too; cloaks, <lb/>
and broadcloth coats, and velvet vests; everything <lb/>
swell, you know; and didn't the salt water fix them <lb/>
out for him? I guess not! Well, going to sea, the <lb/>
mate told him to go aloft and help shake out the fore- <lb/>
to'gallants'l. Up he shins to the foretop, with his <lb/>
spectacles on, and in a minute down he comes again, <lb/>
looking insulted. Says the mate, 'What did you come <lb/>
down for?' Says the chap, 'P'r'aps you didn't notice <lb/>
that there ain't any ladders above there.' You see we <lb/>
hadn't any shrouds above the foretop. The men <lb/>
bursted out in a laugh such as I guess you never <lb/>
heard the like of. Next night, which was dark and <lb/>
rainy, the mate ordered this chap to go aloft about <lb/>
something, and I'm dummed if he didn't start up with <lb/>
an umbrella and a lantern! But no matter; he made <lb/>
a mighty good sailor before the voyage was done, and <lb/>
we had to hunt up something else to laugh at. Years <lb/>
afterwards, when I had forgot all about him, I comes <lb/>
into Boston, mate of a ship, and was loafing around <lb/>
town with the second mate, and it so happened that we <lb/>
stepped into the Revere House, thinking maybe we <lb/>
<pb n="260"/>
would chance the salt-horse in that big dining-room <lb/>
for a flyer, as the boys say. Some fellows were talk- <lb/>
ing just at our elbow, and one says, 'Yonder's the new <lb/>
governor of Massachusetts&#x2014;at that table over there <lb/>
with the ladies.' We took a good look, my mate and <lb/>
I, for we hadn't either of us ever seen a governor be- <lb/>
fore. I looked and looked at that face, and then all <lb/>
of a sudden it popped on me! But I didn't give any <lb/>
sign. Says I, 'Mate, I've a notion to go over and <lb/>
shake hands with him.' Says he, 'I think I see you <lb/>
doing it, Tom.' Says I, 'Mate, I'm a-going to do it.' <lb/>
Says he, 'Oh, yes, I guess so! May be you don't <lb/>
want to bet you will, Tom?' Says I, 'I don't mind <lb/>
going a V on it, mate.' Says he, 'Put it up.' 'Up <lb/>
she goes,' says I, planking the cash. This surprised <lb/>
him. But he covered it, and says, pretty sarcastic, <lb/>
'Hadn't you better take your grub with the governor <lb/>
and the ladies, Tom?' Says I, 'Upon second thoughts, <lb/>
I will.' Says he, 'Well, Tom, you <i>are</i> a dum fool.' <lb/>
Says I, 'Maybe I am, maybe I ain't; but the main <lb/>
question is, do you want to risk two and a half that I <lb/>
won't do it?' 'Make it a V,' says he. 'Done,' says <lb/>
I. I started, him a-giggling and slapping his hand on <lb/>
his thigh, he felt so good. I went over there and <lb/>
leaned my knuckles on the table a minute and looked <lb/>
the governor in the face, and says I, 'Mr. Gardner, <lb/>
don't you know me?' He stared, and I stared, and <lb/>
he stared. Then all of a sudden he sings out, 'Tom <lb/>
Bowling, by the holy poker! Ladies, it's old Tom <lb/>
Bowling, that you've heard me talk about&#x2014;shipmate <lb/>
of mine in the <i>Mary Ann</i>.' He rose up and shook <lb/>
hands with me ever so hearty&#x2014;I sort of glanced <lb/>
around and took a realizing sense of my mate's saucer <lb/>
eyes&#x2014;and then says the governor, 'Plant yourself, <lb/>
Tom, plant yourself; you can't cat your anchor again <lb/>
till you've had a feed with me and the ladies!' I <lb/>
<pb n="261"/>
planted myself alongside the governor, and canted my <lb/>
eye around toward my mate. Well, sir, his dead- <lb/>
lights were bugged out like tompions; and his mouth <lb/>
stood that wide open that you could have laid a ham in <lb/>
it without him noticing it."</p>
<p>There was great applause at the conclusion of the <lb/>
old captain's story; then, after a moment's silence, a <lb/>
grave, pale young man said:</p>
<p>"Had you ever met the governor before?"</p>
<p>The old captain looked steadily at this inquirer <lb/>
awhile, and then got up and walked aft without making <lb/>
any reply. One passenger after another stole a furtive <lb/>
glance at the inquirer, but failed to make him out, and <lb/>
so gave him up. It took some little work to get the <lb/>
talk-machinery to running smoothly again after this <lb/>
derangement; but at length a conversation sprang up <lb/>
about that important and jealously guarded instrument, <lb/>
a ship's timekeeper, its exceeding delicate accuracy, <lb/>
and the wreck and destruction that have sometimes <lb/>
resulted from its varying a few seemingly trifling mo- <lb/>
ments from the true time; then, in due course, my <lb/>
comrade, the Reverend, got off on a yarn, with a fair <lb/>
wind and everything drawing. It was a true story, <lb/>
too&#x2014;about Captain Rounceville's shipwreck&#x2014;true in <lb/>
every detail. It was to this effect:</p>
<p>Captain Rounceville's vessel was lost in mid-Atlantic, <lb/>
and likewise his wife and his two little children. Cap- <lb/>
tain Rounceville and seven seamen escaped with life, <lb/>
but with little else. A small, rudely constructed raft <lb/>
was to be their home for eight days. They had neither <lb/>
provisions nor water. They had scarcely any clothing; <lb/>
no one had a coat but the captain. This coat was <lb/>
changing hands all the time, for the weather was very <lb/>
cold. Whenever a man became exhausted with the <lb/>
cold, they put the coat on him and laid him down be- <lb/>
tween two shipmates until the garment and their bodies <lb/>
<pb n="262"/>
had warmed life into him again. Among the sailors <lb/>
was a Portuguese who knew no English. He seemed to <lb/>
have no thought of his own calamity, but was concerned <lb/>
only about the captain's bitter loss of wife and children. <lb/>
By day he would look his dumb compassion in the <lb/>
captain's face; and by night, in the darkness and the <lb/>
driving spray and rain, he would seek out the captain <lb/>
and try to comfort him with caressing pats on the <lb/>
shoulder. One day, when hunger and thirst were <lb/>
making their sure inroads upon the men's strength and <lb/>
spirits, a floating barrel was seen at a distance. It <lb/>
seemed a great find, for doubtless it contained food of <lb/>
some sort. A brave fellow swam to it, and after long <lb/>
and exhausting effort got it to the raft. It was eagerly <lb/>
opened. It was a barrel of magnesia! On the fifth <lb/>
day an onion was spied. A sailor swam off and got it. <lb/>
Although perishing with hunger, he brought it in its <lb/>
integrity and put it into the captain's hand. The <lb/>
history of the sea teaches that among starving, ship- <lb/>
wrecked men selfishness is rare, and a wonder- <lb/>
compelling magnanimity the rule. The onion was <lb/>
equally divided into eight parts, and eaten with deep <lb/>
thanksgivings. On the eighth day a distant ship was <lb/>
sighted. Attempts were made to hoist an oar, with <lb/>
Captain Rounceville's coat on it for a signal. There <lb/>
were many failures, for the men were but skeletons <lb/>
now, and strengthless. At last success was achieved, <lb/>
but the signal brought no help. The ship faded out of <lb/>
sight and left despair behind her. By and by another <lb/>
ship appeared, and passed so near that the castaways, <lb/>
every eye eloquent with gratitude, made ready to wel- <lb/>
come the boat that would be sent to save them. But <lb/>
this ship also drove on, and left these men staring their <lb/>
unutterable surprise and dismay into each other's ashen <lb/>
faces. Late in the day, still another ship came up out <lb/>
of the distance, but the men noted with a pang that <lb/>
<pb n="263"/>
her course was one which would not bring her nearer. <lb/>
Their remnant of life was nearly spent; their lips and <lb/>
tongues were swollen, parched, cracked with eight <lb/>
days' thirst; their bodies starved; and here was their <lb/>
last chance gliding relentlessly from them; they would <lb/>
not be alive when the next sun rose. For a day or two <lb/>
past the men had lost their voices, but now Captain <lb/>
Rounceville whispered, "Let us pray." The Portu- <lb/>
guese patted him on the shoulder in sign of deep ap- <lb/>
proval. All knelt at the base of the oar that was <lb/>
waving the signal-coat aloft, and bowed their heads. <lb/>
The sea was tossing; the sun rested, a red, rayless <lb/>
disk, on the sea-line in the west. When the men pres- <lb/>
ently raised their heads they would have roared a halle- <lb/>
lujah if they had had a voice; the ship's sails lay <lb/>
wrinkled and flapping against her masts&#x2014;she was <lb/>
going about! Here was rescue at last, and in the very <lb/>
last instant of time that was left for it. No, not rescue <lb/>
yet&#x2014;only the imminent prospect of it. The red disk <lb/>
sank under the sea, and darkness blotted out the ship. <lb/>
By and by came a pleasant sound&#x2014;oars moving in a <lb/>
boat's rowlocks. Nearer it came, and nearer&#x2014;within <lb/>
thirty steps, but nothing visible. Then a deep voice: <lb/>
"Hol-<i>lo!</i>" The castaways could not answer; their <lb/>
swollen tongues refused voice. The boat skirted round <lb/>
and round the raft, started away&#x2014;the agony of it!&#x2014; <lb/>
returned, rested the oars, close at hand, listening, no <lb/>
doubt. The deep voice again: "Hol-<i>lo!</i> Where are <lb/>
ye, shipmates?" Captain Rounceville whispered to <lb/>
his men, saying: "Whisper your best, boys! now&#x2014; <lb/>
all at once!" So they sent out an eightfold whisper <lb/>
in hoarse concert: "Here!" There was life in it if it <lb/>
succeeded; death if it failed. After that supreme mo- <lb/>
ment Captain Rounceville was conscious of nothing <lb/>
until he came to himself on board the saving ship. <lb/>
Said the Reverend, concluding:</p>
<pb n="264"/>
<p>"There was one little moment of time in which that <lb/>
raft could be visible from that ship, and only one. If <lb/>
that one little fleeting moment had passed unfruitful, <lb/>
those men's doom was sealed. As close as that does <lb/>
God shave events foreordained from the beginning of <lb/>
the world. When the sun reached the water's edge <lb/>
that day, the captain of that ship was sitting on deck <lb/>
reading his prayer-book. The book fell; he stooped <lb/>
to pick it up, and happened to glance at the sun. In <lb/>
that instant that far-off raft appeared for a second <lb/>
against the red disk, its needle-like oar and diminutive <lb/>
signal cut sharp and black against the bright surface, <lb/>
and in the next instant was thrust away into the dusk <lb/>
again. But that ship, that captain, and that pregnant <lb/>
instant had had their work appointed for them in the <lb/>
dawn of time and could not fail of the performance. <lb/>
The chronometer of God never errs!"</p>
<p>There was deep, thoughtful silence for some mo- <lb/>
ments. Then the grave, pale young man said:</p>
<p>"What is the chronometer of God?"</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II">
<head><b>II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>At</smcap> dinner, six o'clock, the same people assembled <lb/>
whom we had talked with on deck and seen at luncheon <lb/>
and breakfast this second day out, and at dinner the <lb/>
evening before. That is to say, three journeying ship- <lb/>
masters, a Boston merchant, and a returning Bermudian <lb/>
who had been absent from his Bermuda thirteen years; <lb/>
these sat on the starboard side. On the port side sat <lb/>
the Reverend in the seat of honor; the pale young <lb/>
man next to him; I next; next to me an aged Ber- <lb/>
mudian, returning to his sunny islands after an absence <lb/>
of twenty-seven years. Of course, our captain was <lb/>
<pb n="265"/>
at the head of the table, the purser at the foot of <lb/>
it. A small company, but small companies are <lb/>
pleasantest.</p>
<p>No racks upon the table; the sky cloudless, the sun <lb/>
brilliant, the blue sea scarcely ruffled; then what had <lb/>
become of the four married couples, the three bachelors, <lb/>
and the active and obliging doctor from the rural dis- <lb/>
tricts of Pennsylvania?&#x2014;for all these were on deck <lb/>
when we sailed down New York harbor. This is the <lb/>
explanation. I quote from my note-book: <lb/>
<q>Thursday, 3.30 <smcap>p.m.</smcap> Under way, passing the Battery. The large party, <lb/>
of four married couples, three bachelors, and a cheery, exhilarating doctor <lb/>
from the wilds of Pennsylvania, are evidently traveling together. All but <lb/>

<p>The rout seems permanent; hence the smallness of <lb/>
the company at table since the voyage began. Our <lb/>
captain is a grave, handsome Hercules of thirty-five, <lb/>
with a brown hand of such majestic size that one can- <lb/>
<pb n="266"/>
not eat for admiring it and wondering if a single kid or <lb/>
calf could furnish material for gloving it.</p>
<p>Conversation not general; drones along between <lb/>
couples. One catches a sentence here and there. <lb/>
Like this, from Bermudian of thirteen years' absence: <lb/>
"It is the nature of women to ask trivial, irrelevant, <lb/>
and pursuing questions&#x2014;questions that pursue you <lb/>
from a beginning in nothing to a run-to-cover in no- <lb/>
where." Reply of Bermudian of twenty-seven years' <lb/>
absence: "Yes; and to think they have logical, ana- <lb/>
lytical minds and argumentative ability. You see 'em <lb/>
begin to whet up whenever they smell argument in the <lb/>
air." Plainly these be philosophers.</p>
<p>Twice since we left port our engines have stopped <lb/>
for a couple of minutes at a time. Now they stop <lb/>
again. Says the pale young man, meditatively, "There! <lb/>
&#x2014;that engineer is sitting down to rest again."</p>
<p>Grave stare from the captain, whose mighty jaws <lb/>
cease to work, and whose harpooned potato stops in <lb/>
mid-air on its way to his open, paralyzed mouth. <lb/>
Presently he says in measured tones, "Is it your idea <lb/>
that the engineer of this ship propels her by a crank <lb/>
turned by his own hands?"</p>
<p>The pale young man studies over this a moment, <lb/>
then lifts up his guileless eyes, and says, "Don't he?"</p>
<p>Thus gently falls the death-blow to further conversa- <lb/>
tion, and the dinner drags to its close in a reflective <lb/>
silence, disturbed by no sounds but the murmurous <lb/>
wash of the sea and the subdued clash of teeth.</p>
<p>After a smoke and a promenade on deck, where is <lb/>
no motion to discompose our steps, we think of a game <lb/>
of whist. We ask the brisk and capable stewardess <lb/>
from Ireland if there are any cards in the ship.</p>
<p>"Bless your soul, dear, indeed there is. Not a whole <lb/>
pack, true for ye, but not enough missing to signify."</p>
<p>However, I happened by accident to bethink me of a <lb/>
<pb n="267"/>
new pack in a morocco case, in my trunk, which I had <lb/>
placed there by mistake, thinking it to be a flask of <lb/>
something. So a party of us conquered the tedium of <lb/>
the evening with a few games and were ready for bed <lb/>
at six bells, mariner's time, the signal for putting out <lb/>
the lights.</p>
<p>There was much chat in the smoking-cabin on the <lb/>
upper deck after luncheon to-day, mostly whaler yarns <lb/>
from those old sea captains. Captain Tom Bowling <lb/>
was garrulous. He had that garrulous attention to <lb/>
minor detail which is born of secluded farm life or life <lb/>
at sea on long voyages, where there is little to do and <lb/>
time no object. He would sail along till he was right <lb/>
in the most exciting part of a yarn, and then say, <lb/>
"Well, as I was saying, the rudder was fouled, ship <lb/>
driving before the gale, head-on, straight for the ice- <lb/>
berg, all hands holding their breath, turned to stone, <lb/>
top-hamper giving 'way, sails blown to ribbons, first <lb/>
one stick going, then another, boom! smash! crash! <lb/>
duck your head and stand from under! when up comes <lb/>
Johnny Rogers, capstan bar in hand, eyes a-blazing, <lb/>
hair a-flying&#x2026;&#x2026;no, 'twa'n't Johnny Rogers&#x2026;&#x2026; <lb/>
lemme see&#x2026;&#x2026;seems to me Johnny Rogers wa'n't <lb/>
along that voyage; he was along <i>one</i> voyage, I know <lb/>
that mighty well, but somehow it seems to me that he <lb/>
signed the articles for this voyage, but&#x2014;but&#x2014;whether <lb/>
he come along or not, or got left, or something hap- <lb/>
pened&#x2014;"</p>
<p>And so on and so on till the excitement all cooled <lb/>
down and nobody cared whether the ship struck the <lb/>
iceberg or not.</p>
<p>In the course of his talk he rambled into a criticism <lb/>
upon New England degrees of merit in shipbuilding. <lb/>
Said he "You get a vessel built away down Maine- <lb/>
way; Bath, for instance; what's the result? First <lb/>
thing you do, you want to heave her down for repairs <lb/>
<pb n="268"/>
&#x2014;<i>that's</i> the result! Well, sir, she hain't been hove <lb/>
down a week till you can heave a dog through her <lb/>
seams. You send that vessel to sea, and what's the <lb/>
result? She wets her oakum the first trip! Leave it <lb/>
to any man if 'tain't so. Well, you let <i>our</i> folks build <lb/>
you a vessel&#x2014;down New Bedford-way. What's the <lb/>
result? Well, sir, you might take that ship and heave <lb/>
her down, and keep her hove down six months, and <lb/>
she'll never shed a tear!"</p>
<p>Everybody, landsmen and all, recognized the descrip- <lb/>
tive neatness of that figure, and applauded, which <lb/>
greatly pleased the old man. A moment later, the <lb/>
meek eyes of the pale young fellow heretofore men- <lb/>
tioned came up slowly, rested upon the old man's face <lb/>
a moment, and the meek mouth began to open.</p>
<p>"Shet your head!" shouted the old mariner.</p>
<p>It was a rather startling surprise to everybody, but it <lb/>
was effective in the matter of its purpose. So the con- <lb/>
versation flowed on instead of perishing.</p>
<p>There was some talk about the perils of the sea, and <lb/>
a landsman delivered himself of the customary non- <lb/>
sense about the poor mariner wandering in far oceans, <lb/>
tempest-tossed, pursued by dangers, every storm-blast <lb/>
and thunder-bolt in the home skies moving the friends <lb/>
by snug firesides to compassion for that poor mariner, <lb/>
and prayers for his succor. Captain Bowling put up <lb/>
with this for a while, and then burst out with a new <lb/>
view of the matter.</p>
<p>"Come, belay there! I have read this kind of rot <lb/>
all my life in poetry and tales and such like rubbage. <lb/>
Pity for the poor mariner! sympathy for the poor <lb/>
mariner! All right enough, but not in the way the <lb/>
poetry puts it. Pity for the mariner's wife! all right <lb/>
again, but not in the way the poetry puts it. Look-a- <lb/>
here! whose life's the safest in the whole world? The <lb/>
poor mariner's. You look at the statistics, you'll see. <lb/>
<pb n="269"/>
So don't you fool away any sympathy on the poor <lb/>
mariner's dangers and privations and sufferings. Leave <lb/>
that to the poetry muffs. Now you look at the other <lb/>
side a minute. Here is Captain Brace, forty years old, <lb/>
been at sea thirty. On his way now to take command <lb/>
of his ship and sail south from Bermuda. Next week <lb/>
he'll be under way; easy times; comfortable quarters; <lb/>
passengers, sociable company; just enough to do to <lb/>
keep his mind healthy and not tire him; king over his <lb/>
ship, boss of everything and everybody; thirty years' <lb/>
safety to learn him that his profession ain't a dangerous <lb/>
one. Now you look back at his home. His wife's a <lb/>
feeble woman; she's a stranger in New York; shut up <lb/>
in blazing hot or freezing cold lodgings, according to <lb/>
the season; don't know anybody hardly; no company <lb/>
but her lonesomeness and her thoughts; husband gone <lb/>
six months at a time. She has borne eight children; <lb/>
five of them she has buried without her husband ever <lb/>
setting eyes on them. She watched them all the long <lb/>
nights till they died&#x2014;he comfortable on the sea; she <lb/>
followed them to the grave, she heard the clods fall <lb/>
that broke her heart&#x2014;he comfortable on the sea; she <lb/>
mourned at home, weeks and weeks, missing them <lb/>
every day and every hour&#x2014;he cheerful at sea, know- <lb/>
ing nothing about it. Now look at it a minute&#x2014;turn <lb/>
it over in your mind and size it: five children born, <lb/>
she among strangers, and him not by to hearten her; <lb/>
buried, and him not by to comfort her; think of that! <lb/>
Sympathy for the poor mariner's perils is rot; give it <lb/>
to his wife's hard lines, where it belongs! Poetry <lb/>
makes out that all the wife worries about is the dangers <lb/>
her husband's running. She's got substantialer things <lb/>
to worry over, I tell you. Poetry's always pitying the <lb/>
poor mariner on account of his perils at sea; better a <lb/>
blamed sight pity him for the nights he can't sleep for <lb/>
thinking of how he had to leave his wife in her very <lb/>
<pb n="270"/>
birth pains, lonesome and friendless, in the thick of <lb/>
disease and trouble and death. If there's one thing <lb/>
that can make me madder than another, it's this sappy, <lb/>
damned maritime poetry!"</p>
<p>Captain Brace was a patient, gentle, seldom-speaking <lb/>
man, with a pathetic something in his bronzed face <lb/>
that had been a mystery up to this time, but stood <lb/>
interpreted now since we had heard his story. He had <lb/>
voyaged eighteen times to the Mediterranean, seven <lb/>
times to India, once to the arctic pole in a discovery- <lb/>
ship, and "between times" had visited all the remote <lb/>
seas and ocean corners of the globe. But he said that <lb/>
twelve years go, on account of his family, he "settled <lb/>
down," and ever since then had ceased to roam. And <lb/>
what do you suppose was this simple-hearted, lifelong <lb/>
wanderer's idea of settling down and ceasing to roam? <lb/>
Why, the making of two five-month voyages a year <lb/>
between Surinam and Boston for sugar and molasses!</p>
<p>Among other talk to-day, it came out that whale- <lb/>
ships carry no doctor. The captain adds the doctor- <lb/>
ship to his own duties. He not only gives medicines, <lb/>
but sets broken limbs after notions of his own, or saws <lb/>
them off and sears the stump when amputation seems <lb/>
best. The captain is provided with a medicine-chest, <lb/>
with the medicines numbered instead of named. A <lb/>
book of directions goes with this. It describes diseases <lb/>
and symptoms, and says, "Give a teaspoonful of No. <lb/>
9 once an hour," or "Give ten grains of No. 12 every <lb/>
half hour," etc. One of our sea captains came across <lb/>
a skipper in the North Pacific who was in a state of <lb/>
great surprise and perplexity. Said he:</p>
<p>"There's something rotten about this medicine-chest <lb/>
business. One of my men was sick&#x2014;nothing much <lb/>
the matter. I looked in the book: it said, give him a <lb/>
teaspoonful of No. 15. I went to the medicine-chest, <lb/>
and I see I was out of No. 15. I judged I'd got to <lb/>
<pb n="271"/>
get up a combination somehow that would fill the bill; <lb/>
so I hove into the fellow half a teaspoonful of No. 8 <lb/>
and half a teaspoonful of No. 7, and I'll be hanged if <lb/>
it didn't kill him in fifteen minutes! There's some- <lb/>
thing about this medicine-chest system that's too many <lb/>
for me!"</p>
<p>There was a good deal of pleasant gossip about old <lb/>
Captain "Hurricane" Jones, of the Pacific ocean&#x2014; <lb/>
peace to his ashes! Two or three of us present had <lb/>
known him; I particularly well, for I had made four sea- <lb/>
voyages with him. He was a very remarkable man. <lb/>
He was born in a ship; he picked up what little educa- <lb/>
tion he had among his shipmates; he began life in the <lb/>
forecastle, and climbed grade by grade to the cap- <lb/>
taincy. More than fifty years of his sixty-five were <lb/>
spent at sea. He had sailed all oceans, seen all lands, <lb/>
and borrowed a tint from all climates. When a man <lb/>
has been fifty years at sea he necessarily knows nothing <lb/>
of men, nothing of the world but its surface, nothing <lb/>
of the world's thought, nothing of the world's learning <lb/>
but its A B C, and that blurred and distorted by the <lb/>
unfocused lenses of an untrained mind. Such a man <lb/>
is only a gray and bearded child. That is what old <lb/>
Hurricane Jones was&#x2014;simply an innocent, lovable old <lb/>
infant. When his spirit was in repose he was as sweet <lb/>
and gentle as a girl; when his wrath was up he was a <lb/>
hurricane that made his nickname seem tamely descrip- <lb/>
tive. He was formidable in a fight, for he was of <lb/>
powerful build and dauntless courage. He was fres- <lb/>
coed from head to heel with pictures and mottoes <lb/>
tattooed in red and blue India ink. I was with him <lb/>
one voyage when he got his last vacant space tattooed; <lb/>
this vacant space was around his left ankle. During <lb/>
three days he stumped about the ship with his ankle <lb/>
bare and swollen, and this legend gleaming red and <lb/>
angry out from a clouding of India ink: "Virtue is its <lb/>
<pb n="272"/>
own R'd." (There was a lack of room.) He was <lb/>
deeply and sincerely pious, and swore like a fish- <lb/>
woman. He considered swearing blameless, because <lb/>
sailors would not understand an order unillumined by <lb/>
it. He was a profound biblical scholar&#x2014;that is, he <lb/>
thought he was. He believed everything in the Bible <lb/>
but he had his own methods of arriving at his beliefs. <lb/>
He was of the "advanced" school of thinkers, and <lb/>
applied natural laws to the interpretation of all miracles, <lb/>
somewhat on the plan of the people who make the <lb/>
six days of creation six geological epochs, and so <lb/>
forth. Without being aware of it, he was a rather <lb/>
severe satire on modern scientific religionists. Such <lb/>
a man as I have been describing is rabidly fond of <lb/>
disquisition and argument; one knows that without <lb/>
being told it.</p>
<p>One trip the captain had a clergyman on board, but <lb/>
did not know he was a clergyman, since the passenger <lb/>
list did not betray the fact. He took a great liking to <lb/>
this Reverend Mr. Peters, and talked with him a great <lb/>
deal; told him yarns, gave him toothsome scraps of <lb/>
personal history, and wove a glittering streak of pro- <lb/>
fanity through his garrulous fabric that was refreshing <lb/>
to a spirit weary of the dull neutralities of undecorated <lb/>
speech. One day the captain said, "Peters, do you <lb/>
ever read the Bible?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;yes."</p>
<p>"I judge it ain't often, by the way you say it. <lb/>
Now, you tackle it in dead earnest once, and you'll <lb/>
find it'll pay. Don't you get discouraged, but hang <lb/>
right on. First, you won't understand it; but by and <lb/>
by things will begin to clear up, and then you wouldn't <lb/>
lay it down to eat."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have heard that said."</p>
<p>"And it's so, too. There ain't a book that begins <lb/>
with it. It lays over'm all, Peters. There's some <lb/>
<pb n="273"/>
pretty tough things in it&#x2014;there ain't any getting <lb/>
around that&#x2014;but you stick to them and think them <lb/>
out, and when once you get on the inside everything's <lb/>
plain as day."</p>
<p>"The miracles, too, captain?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir! the miracles, too. Every one of them. <lb/>
Now, there's that business with the prophets of Baal; <lb/>
like enough that stumped you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Own up now; it stumped you. Well, I don't <lb/>
wonder. You hadn't had any experience in raveling <lb/>
such things out, and naturally it was too many for you. <lb/>
Would you like to have me explain that thing to you, <lb/>
and show you how to get at the meat of these matters?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I would, captain, if you don't mind."</p>
<p>Then the captain proceeded as follows: "I'll do it <lb/>
with pleasure. First, you see, I read and read, and <lb/>
thought and thought, till I got to understand what sort <lb/>
of people they were in the old Bible times, and then <lb/>
after that it was all clear and easy. Now this was the <lb/>
way I put it up, concerning Isaac<ref target="n4">*</ref><note id="n4" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>This is the captain's own mistake.</p></note> and the prophets of <lb/>
Baal. There was some mighty sharp men among the <lb/>
public characters of that old ancient day, and Isaac <lb/>
was one of them. Isaac had his failings&#x2014;plenty of <lb/>
them, too; it ain't for me to apologize for Isaac; he <lb/>
played it on the prophets of Baal, and like enough he <lb/>
was justifiable, considering the odds that was against <lb/>
him. No, all I say is, 'twa'n't any miracle, and that <lb/>
I'll show you so's't you can see it yourself.</p>
<p>"Well, times had been getting rougher and rougher <lb/>
for prophets&#x2014;that is, prophets of Isaac's denomina- <lb/>
tion. There was four hundred and fifty prophets of <lb/>
Baal in the community, and only one Presbyterian; <lb/>
that is, if Isaac <i>was</i> a Presbyterian, which I reckon he <lb/>
was, but it don't say. Naturally, the prophets of Baal <lb/>
<pb n="274"/>
took all the trade. Isaac was pretty low-spirited, I <lb/>
reckon, but he was a good deal of a man, and no doubt <lb/>
he went a-prophesying around, letting on to be doing a <lb/>
land-office business, but 'twa'n't any use; he couldn't <lb/>
run any opposition to amount to anything. By and by <lb/>
things got desperate with him; he sets his head to <lb/>
work and thinks it all out, and then what does he do? <lb/>
Why, he begins to throw out hints that the other <lb/>
parties are this and that and t'other&#x2014;nothing very <lb/>
definite, maybe, but just kind of undermining their <lb/>
reputation in a quiet way. This made talk, of course, <lb/>
and finally got to the king. The king asked Isaac <lb/>
what he meant by his talk. Says Isaac, 'Oh, nothing <lb/>
particular; only, can they pray down fire from heaven <lb/>
on an altar? It ain't much, maybe, your majesty, <lb/>
only can they <i>do</i> it? That's the idea.' So the king <lb/>
was a good deal disturbed, and he went to the prophets <lb/>
of Baal, and they said, pretty airy, that if he had an <lb/>
altar ready, <i>they</i> were ready; and they intimated he <lb/>
better get it insured, too.</p>
<p>"So next morning all the children of Israel and their <lb/>
parents and the other people gathered themselves to- <lb/>
gether. Well, here was that great crowd of prophets <lb/>
of Baal packed together on one side, and Isaac walking <lb/>
up and down all alone on the other, putting up his job. <lb/>
When time was called, Isaac let on to be comfortable <lb/>
and indifferent; told the other team to take the first <lb/>
innings. So they went at it, the whole four hundred <lb/>
and fifty, praying around the altar, very hopeful, and <lb/>
doing their level best. They prayed an hour&#x2014;two <lb/>
hours&#x2014;three hours&#x2014;and so on, plumb till noon. It <lb/>
wa'n't any use; they hadn't took a trick. Of course <lb/>
they felt kind of ashamed before all those people, and <lb/>
well they might. Now, what would a magnanimous <lb/>
man do? Keep still, wouldn't he? Of course. What <lb/>
did Isaac do? He graveled the prophets of Baal every <lb/>
<pb n="275"/>
way he could think of. Says he, 'You don't speak <lb/>
up loud enough; your god's asleep, like enough, or <lb/>
maybe he's taking a walk; you want to holler, you <lb/>
know'&#x2014;or words to that effect; I don't recollect the <lb/>
exact language. Mind, I don't apologize for Isaac; <lb/>
he had his faults.</p>
<p>"Well, the prophets of Baal prayed along the best <lb/>
they knew how all the afternoon, and never raised a <lb/>
spark. At last, about sundown, they were all tuckered <lb/>
out, and they owned up and quit.</p>
<p>"What does Isaac do now? He steps up and says <lb/>
to some friends of his there, 'Pour four barrels of <lb/>
water on the altar!' Everybody was astonished; for <lb/>
the other side had prayed at it dry, you know, and got <lb/>
whitewashed. They poured it on. Says he, 'Heave <lb/>
on four more barrels.' Then he says, 'Heave on four <lb/>
more.' Twelve barrels, you see, altogether. The <lb/>
water ran all over the altar, and all down the sides, <lb/>
and filled up a trench around it that would hold a <lb/>
couple of hogsheads&#x2014;'measures,' it says; I reckon it <lb/>
means about a hogshead. Some of the people were <lb/>
going to put on their things and go, for they allowed <lb/>
he was crazy. They didn't know Isaac. Isaac knelt <lb/>
down and began to pray; he strung along, and strung <lb/>
along, about the heathen in distant lands, and about <lb/>
the sister churches, and about the state and the country <lb/>
at large, and about those that's in authority in the <lb/>
government, and all the usual programme, you know, <lb/>
till everybody had got tired and gone to thinking about <lb/>
something else, and then, all of a sudden, when nobody <lb/>
was noticing, he outs with a match and rakes it on the <lb/>
under side of his leg, and pff! up the whole thing <lb/>
blazes like a house afire! Twelve barrels of <i>water? <lb/>
Petroleum</i>, sir, <smcap>petroleum</smcap>! that's what it was!"</p>
<p>"Petroleum, captain?"</p>
<p>"Yes, <unclear>sir</unclear> the country was full of it. Isaac knew <lb/>
<pb n="276"/>
all about that. You read the Bible. Don't you worry <lb/>
about the tough places. They ain't tough when you <lb/>
come to think them out and throw light on them. <lb/>
There ain't a thing in the Bible but what is true; all <lb/>
you want is to go prayerfully to work and cipher out <lb/>
how 't was done."</p>
<p>At eight o'clock on the third morning out from New <lb/>
York, land was sighted. Away across the sunny waves <lb/>
one saw a faint dark stripe stretched along under the <lb/>
horizon&#x2014;or pretended to see it, for the credit of his <lb/>
eyesight. Even the Reverend said he saw it, a thing <lb/>
which was manifestly not so. But I never have seen <lb/>
any one who was morally strong enough to confess <lb/>
that he could not see land when others claimed that <lb/>
they could.</p>
<p>By and by the Bermuda islands were easily visible. <lb/>
The principal one lay upon the water in the distance, <lb/>
a long, dull-colored body, scalloped with slight hills <lb/>
and valleys. We could not go straight at it, but had <lb/>
to travel all the way around it, sixteen miles from <lb/>
shore, because it is fenced with an invisible coral reef. <lb/>
At last we sighted buoys, bobbing here and there, and <lb/>
then we glided into a narrow channel among them, <lb/>
"raised the reef," and came upon shoaling blue water <lb/>
that soon further shoaled into pale green, with a sur- <lb/>
face scarcely rippled. Now came the resurrection <lb/>
hour; the berths gave up their dead. Who are these <lb/>
pale specters in plug hats and silken flounces that file <lb/>
up the companion-way in melancholy procession and <lb/>
step upon the deck? These are they which took the <lb/>
infallible preventive of seasickness in New York harbor <lb/>
and then disappeared and were forgotten. Also there <lb/>
came two or three faces not seen before until this mo- <lb/>
ment. One's impulse is to ask, "Where did <i>you</i> come <lb/>
aboard?"</p>
<p>We followed the narrow channel a long time, with <lb/>
<pb n="277"/>
land on both sides&#x2014;low hills that might have been <lb/>
green and grassy, but had a faded look instead. How- <lb/>
ever, the land-locked water was lovely, at any rate, <lb/>
with its glittering belts of blue and green where moder- <lb/>
ate soundings were, and its broad splotches of rich <lb/>
brown where the rocks lay near the surface. Every- <lb/>
body was feeling so well that even the grave, pale <lb/>
young man (who, by a sort of kindly common consent, <lb/>
had come latterly to be referred to as "The Ass") <lb/>
received frequent and friendly notice&#x2014;which was right <lb/>
enough, for there was no harm in him.</p>
<p>At last we steamed between two island points whose <lb/>
rocky jaws allowed only just enough room for the <lb/>
vessel's body, and now before us loomed Hamilton on <lb/>
her clustered hillsides and summits, the whitest mass <lb/>
of terraced architecture that exists in the world, perhaps.</p>
<p>It was Sunday afternoon, and on the pier were <lb/>
gathered one or two hundred Bermudians, half of them <lb/>
black, half of them white, and all of them nobbily <lb/>
dressed, as the poet says.</p>
<p>Several boats came off to the ship, bringing citizens. <lb/>
One of these citizens was a faded, diminutive old <lb/>
gentleman, who approached our most ancient passen- <lb/>
ger with a childlike joy in his twinkling eyes, halted <lb/>
before him, folded his arms, and said, smiling with all <lb/>
his might and with all the simple delight that was in <lb/>
him, "You don't know me, John! Come, out with it <lb/>
now; you know you don't!"</p>
<p>The ancient passenger scanned him perplexedly, <lb/>
scanned the napless, threadbare costume of venerable <lb/>
fashion that had done Sunday service no man knows <lb/>
how many years, contemplated the marvelous stove- <lb/>
pipe hat of still more ancient and venerable pattern, <lb/>
with its poor pathetic old stiff brim canted up "gal- <lb/>
lusly" in the wrong places, and said, with a hesitation <lb/>
that indicated strong internal effort to "place" the <lb/>
<pb n="278"/>
gentle old apparition, "Why&#x2026;&#x2026;let me see&#x2026;&#x2026; <lb/>
plague on it&#x2026;&#x2026;there's <i>something</i> about you that <lb/>
&#x2026;&#x2026;er&#x2026;&#x2026;er&#x2026;&#x2026;but I've been gone from Ber- <lb/>
muda for twenty-seven years, and&#x2026;&#x2026;hum, hum <lb/>
&#x2026;&#x2026;I don't seem to get at it, somehow, but there's <lb/>
something about you that is just as familiar to me <lb/>
as&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Likely it might be his hat," murmured the Ass, <lb/>
with innocent, sympathetic interest.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="III">
<head><b>III.</b></head>
<p><smcap>So</smcap> the Reverend and I had at last arrived at Hamil- <lb/>
ton, the principal town in the Bermuda Islands. A <lb/>
wonderfully white town; white as snow itself. White <lb/>
as marble; white as flour. Yet looking like none of <lb/>
these, exactly. Never mind, we said; we shall hit <lb/>
upon a figure by and by that will describe this peculiar <lb/>
white.</p>
<p>It was a town that was compacted together upon the <lb/>
sides and tops of a cluster of small hills. Its outlying <lb/>
borders fringed off and thinned away among the cedar <lb/>
forests, and there was no woody distance of curving <lb/>
coast, or leafy islet sleeping upon the dimpled, painted <lb/>
sea, but was flecked with shining white points&#x2014;half- <lb/>
concealed houses peeping out of the foliage. The <lb/>
architecture of the town was mainly Spanish, inherited <lb/>
from the colonists of two hundred and fifty years ago. <lb/>
Some ragged-topped cocoa-palms, glimpsed here and <lb/>
there, gave the land a tropical aspect.</p>
<p>There was an ample pier of heavy masonry; upon <lb/>
this, under shelter, were some thousands of barrels con- <lb/>
taining that product which has carried the fame of Ber- <lb/>
muda to many lands, the potato. With here and there <lb/>
<pb n="279"/>
an onion. That last sentence is facetious; for they <lb/>
grow at least two onions in Bermuda to one potato. <lb/>
The onion is the pride and joy of Bermuda. It is her <lb/>
jewel, her gem of gems. In her conversation, her pul- <lb/>
pit, her literature, it is her most frequent and eloquent <lb/>
figure. In Bermuda metaphor it stands for perfection <lb/>
&#x2014;perfection absolute.</p>
<p>The Bermudian weeping over the departed exhausts <lb/>
praise when he says, "He was an onion!" The <lb/>
Bermudian extolling the living hero bankrupts applause <lb/>
when he says, "He is an onion!" The Bermudian <lb/>
setting his son upon the stage of life to dare and do for <lb/>
himself climaxes all counsel, supplication, admonition, <lb/>
comprehends all ambition, when he says, "Be an <lb/>
onion!"</p>
<p>When parallel with the pier, and ten or fifteen steps <lb/>
outside it, we anchored. It was Sunday, bright and <lb/>
sunny. The groups upon the pier&#x2014;men, youths, and <lb/>
boys&#x2014;were whites and blacks in about equal propor- <lb/>
tion. All were well and neatly dressed, many of them <lb/>
nattily, a few of them very stylishly. One would have <lb/>
to travel far before he would find another town of <lb/>
twelve thousand inhabitants that could represent itself <lb/>
so respectably, in the matter of clothes, on a freight <lb/>
pier, without premeditation or effort. The women and <lb/>
young girls, black and white, who occasionally passed <lb/>
by, were nicely clad, and many were elegantly and <lb/>
fashionably so. The men did not affect summer cloth- <lb/>
ing much, but the girls and women did, and their white <lb/>
garments were good to look at, after so many months <lb/>
of familiarity with somber colors.</p>
<p>Around one isolated potato barrel stood four young <lb/>
gentlemen, two black, two white, becomingly dressed, <lb/>
each with the head of a slender cane pressed against his <lb/>
teeth, and each with a foot propped up on the barrel. <lb/>
Another young gentleman came up, looked longingly <lb/>
<pb n="280"/>
at the barrel, but saw no rest for his foot there, and <lb/>
turned pensively away to seek another barrel. He <lb/>
wandered here and there, but without result. Nobody <lb/>
sat upon a barrel, as is the custom of the idle in other <lb/>
lands, yet all the isolated barrels were humanly occu- <lb/>
pied. Whosoever had a foot to spare put it on a bar- <lb/>
rel, if all the places on it were not already taken. The <lb/>
habits of all peoples are determined by their circum- <lb/>
stances. The Bermudians lean upon barrels because <lb/>
of the scarcity of lamp-posts.</p>
<p>Many citizens came on board and spoke eagerly to the <lb/>
officers&#x2014;inquiring about the Turco-Russian war news, <lb/>
I supposed. However, by listening judiciously I found <lb/>
that this was not so. They said, "What is the price <lb/>
of onions?" or, "How's onions?" Naturally enough <lb/>
this was their first interest; but they dropped into the <lb/>
war the moment it was satisfied.</p>
<p>We went ashore and found a novelty of a pleasant <lb/>
nature: there were no hackmen, hacks, or omnibuses <lb/>
on the pier or about it anywhere, and nobody offered <lb/>
his services to us, or molested us in any way. I said <lb/>
it was like being in heaven. The Reverend rebukingly <lb/>
and rather pointedly advised me to make the most of <lb/>
it, then. We knew of a boarding-house, and what we <lb/>
needed now was somebody to pilot us to it. Presently <lb/>
a little barefooted colored boy came along, whose rag- <lb/>
gedness was conspicuously un-Bermudian. His rear <lb/>
was so marvelously bepatched with colored squares and <lb/>
triangles that one was half persuaded he had got it out <lb/>
of an atlas. When the sun struck him right, he was <lb/>
as good to follow as a lightning-bug. We hired him <lb/>
and dropped into his wake. He piloted us through one <lb/>
picturesque street after another, and in due course de- <lb/>
posited us where we belonged. He charged nothing <lb/>
for his map, and but a trifle for his services: so the <lb/>
Reverend doubled it. The little chap received the <lb/>
<pb n="281"/>
money with a beaming applause in his eye which <lb/>
plainly said, "This man's an onion!"</p>
<p>We had brought no letters of introduction; our <lb/>
names had been misspelt in the passenger list; nobody <lb/>
knew whether we were honest folk or otherwise. So <lb/>
we were expecting to have a good private time in case <lb/>
there was nothing in our general aspect to close board- <lb/>
ing-house doors against us. We had no trouble. <lb/>
Bermuda has had but little experience of rascals, and <lb/>
is not suspicious. We got large, cool, well-lighted <lb/>
rooms on a second floor, overlooking a bloomy display <lb/>
of flowers and flowering shrubs,&#x2014;calla and annuncia- <lb/>
tion lilies, lantanas, heliotrope, jessamine, roses, pinks, <lb/>
double geraniums, oleanders, pomegranates, blue morn- <lb/>
ing-glories of a great size, and many plants that were <lb/>
unknown to me.</p>
<p>We took a long afternoon walk, and soon found out <lb/>
that that exceedingly white town was built of blocks of <lb/>
white coral. Bermuda is a coral island, with a six-inch <lb/>
crust of soil on top of it, and every man has a quarry <lb/>
on his own premises. Everywhere you go you see <lb/>
square recesses cut into the hillsides, with perpendicular <lb/>
walls unmarred by crack or crevice, and perhaps you <lb/>
fancy that a house grew out of the ground there, and <lb/>
has been removed in a single piece from the mould. <lb/>
If you do, you err. But the material for a house has <lb/>
been quarried there. They cut right down through the <lb/>
coral, to any depth that is convenient&#x2014;ten to twenty <lb/>
feet&#x2014;and take it out in great square blocks. This <lb/>
cutting is done with a chisel that has a handle twelve or <lb/>
fifteen feet long, and is used as one uses a crowbar <lb/>
when he is drilling a hole, or a dasher when he is churn- <lb/>
ing. Thus soft is this stone. Then with a common <lb/>
handsaw they saw the great blocks into handsome, <lb/>
huge bricks that are two feet long, a foot wide, and <lb/>
about six inches thick. These stand loosely piled <lb/>
<pb n="282"/>
during a month to harden; then the work of building <lb/>
begins.</p>
<p>The house is built of these blocks; it is roofed with <lb/>
broad coral slabs an inch thick, whose edges lap upon <lb/>
each other, so that the roof looks like a succession of <lb/>
shallow steps or terraces; the chimneys are built of the <lb/>
coral blocks, and sawed into graceful and picturesque <lb/>
patterns; the ground-flour veranda is paved with coral <lb/>
blocks; also the walk to the gate; the fence is built of <lb/>
coral blocks&#x2014;built in massive panels, with broad cap- <lb/>
stones and heavy gateposts, and the whole trimmed <lb/>
into easy lines and comely shape with the saw. Then <lb/>
they put a hard coat of whitewash, as thick as your <lb/>
thumb nail, on the fence and all over the house, roof, <lb/>
chimneys, and all; the sun comes out and shines on <lb/>
this spectacle, and it is time for you to shut your unac- <lb/>
customed eyes, lest they be put out. It is the whitest <lb/>
white you can conceive of, and the blindingest. A <lb/>
Bermuda house does not look like marble; it is a much <lb/>
intenser white than that; and, besides, there is a dainty, <lb/>
indefinable something else about its look that is not <lb/>
marble-like. We put in a great deal of solid talk and <lb/>
reflection over this matter of trying to find a figure that <lb/>
would describe the unique white of a Bermuda house, <lb/>
and we contrived to hit upon it at last. It is exactly the <lb/>
white of the icing of a cake, and has the same un- <lb/>
emphasized and scarcely perceptible polish. The white <lb/>
of marble is modest and retiring compared with it.</p>
<p>After the house is cased in its hard scale of white- <lb/>
wash, not a crack, or sign of a seam, or joining of the <lb/>
blocks is detectable, from base-stone to chimney-top; <lb/>
the building looks as if it had been carved from a single <lb/>
block of stone, and the doors and windows sawed out <lb/>
afterwards. A white marble house has a cold, tomb- <lb/>
like, unsociable look, and takes the conversation out of <lb/>
a body and depresses him. Not so with a Bermuda <lb/>
<pb n="283"/>
house. There is something exhilarating, even hilarious, <lb/>
about its vivid whiteness when the sun plays upon it. <lb/>
If it be of picturesque shape and graceful contour&#x2014; <lb/>
and many of the Bermudian dwellings are&#x2014;it will so <lb/>
fascinate you that you will keep your eyes on it until <lb/>
they ache. One of those clean-cut, fanciful chimneys <lb/>
&#x2014;too pure and white for this world&#x2014;with one side <lb/>
glowing in the sun and the other touched with a soft <lb/>
shadow, is an object that will charm one's gaze by the <lb/>
hour. I know of no other country that has chimneys <lb/>
worthy to be gazed at and gloated over. One of those <lb/>
snowy houses, half concealed and half glimpsed through <lb/>
green foliage, is a pretty thing to see; and if it takes <lb/>
one by surprise and suddenly, as he turns a sharp <lb/>
corner of a country road, it will wring an exclamation <lb/>
from him, sure.</p>
<p>Wherever you go, in town or country, you find those <lb/>
snowy houses, and always with masses of bright-colored <lb/>
flowers about them, but with no vines climbing their <lb/>
walls; vines cannot take hold of the smooth, hard <lb/>
whitewash. Wherever you go, in the town or along <lb/>
the country roads, among little potato farms and <lb/>
patches or expensive country seats, these stainless white <lb/>
dwellings, gleaming out from flowers and foliage, meet <lb/>
you at every turn. The least little bit of a cottage is <lb/>
as white and blemishless as the stateliest mansion. <lb/>
Nowhere is there dirt or stench, puddle or hog-wallow, <lb/>
neglect, disorder, or lack of trimness and neatness. <lb/>
The roads, the streets, the dwellings, the people, the <lb/>
clothes,&#x2014;this neatness extends to everything that falls <lb/>
under the eye. It is the tidiest country in the world. <lb/>
And very much the tidiest, too.</p>
<p>Considering these things, the question came up, <lb/>
Where do the poor live? No answer was arrived at. <lb/>
Therefore, we agreed to leave this conundrum for <lb/>
future statesmen to wrangle over.</p>
<pb n="284"/>
<p>What a bright and startling spectacle one of those <lb/>
blazing white country palaces, with its brown-tinted <lb/>
window caps and ledges, and green shutters, and its <lb/>
wealth of caressing flowers and foliage, would be in <lb/>
black London! And what a gleaming surprise it would <lb/>
be in nearly any American city one could mention, too!</p>
<p>Bermuda roads are made by cutting down a few <lb/>
inches into the solid white coral&#x2014;or a good many <lb/>
feet, where a hill intrudes itself&#x2014;and smoothing off <lb/>
the surface of the roadbed. It is a simple and easy <lb/>
process. The grain of the coral is coarse and porous; <lb/>
the roadbed has the look of being made of coarse white <lb/>
sugar. Its excessive cleanness and whiteness are a <lb/>
trouble in one way: the sun is reflected into your eyes <lb/>
with such energy as you walk along that you want to <lb/>
sneeze all the time. Old Captain Tom Bowling found <lb/>
another difficulty. He joined us in our walk, but kept <lb/>
wandering unrestfully to the roadside. Finally he ex- <lb/>
plained. Said he, "Well, I chew, you know, and the <lb/>
road's so plaguy clean."</p>
<p>We walked several miles that afternoon in the be- <lb/>
wildering glare of the sun, the white roads, and the <lb/>
white buildings. Our eyes got to paining us a good <lb/>
deal. By and by a soothing, blessed twilight spread its <lb/>
cool balm around. We looked up in pleased surprise <lb/>
and saw that it proceeded from an intensely black negro <lb/>
who was going by. We answered his military salute <lb/>
in the grateful gloom of his near presence, and then <lb/>
passed on into the pitiless white glare again.</p>
<p>The colored women whom we met usually bowed and <lb/>
spoke; so did the children. The colored men com- <lb/>
monly gave the military salute. They borrow this fash- <lb/>
ion from the soldiers, no doubt; England has kept a <lb/>
garrison here for generations. The younger men's <lb/>
custom of carrying small canes is also borrowed from <lb/>
the soldiers, I suppose, who always carry a cane, in <lb/>
<pb n="285"/>
Bermuda as everywhere else in Britain's broad domin- <lb/>
ions.</p>
<p>The country roads curve and wind hither and thither <lb/>
in the delightfulest way, unfolding pretty surprises at <lb/>
every turn: billowy masses of oleander that seem to <lb/>
float out from behind distant projections like the pink <lb/>
cloud-banks of sunset; sudden plunges among cottages <lb/>
and gardens, life and activity, followed by as sudden <lb/>
plunges into the somber twilight and stillness of the <lb/>
woods; flitting visions of white fortresses and beacon <lb/>
towers pictured against the sky on remote hilltops; <lb/>
glimpses of shining green sea caught for a moment <lb/>
through opening headlands, then lost again; more <lb/>
woods and solitude; and by and by another turn lays <lb/>
bare, without warning, the full sweep of the inland <lb/>
ocean, enriched with its bars of soft color and graced <lb/>
with its wandering sails.</p>
<p>Take any road you please, you may depend upon it <lb/>
you will not stay in it half a mile. Your road is every- <lb/>
thing that a road ought to be: it is bordered with <lb/>
trees, and with strange plants and flowers; it is shady <lb/>
and pleasant, or sunny and still pleasant; it carries you <lb/>
by the prettiest and peacefulest and most homelike of <lb/>
homes, and through stretches of forest that lie in a deep <lb/>
hush sometimes, and sometimes are alive with the music <lb/>
of birds; it curves always, which is a continual promise, <lb/>
whereas straight roads reveal everything at a glance and <lb/>
kill interest. Your road is all this, and yet you will <lb/>
not stay in it half a mile, for the reason that little se- <lb/>
ductive, mysterious roads are always branching out from <lb/>
it on either hand, and as these curve sharply also and <lb/>
hide what is beyond, you cannot resist the temptation <lb/>
to desert your own chosen road and explore them. <lb/>
You are usually paid for your trouble; consequently, <lb/>
your walk inland always turns out to be one of the <lb/>
most crooked, involved, purposeless, and interesting <lb/>
<pb n="286"/>
experiences a body can imagine. There is enough of <lb/>
variety. Sometimes you are in the level open, with <lb/>
marshes thick grown with flag-lances that are ten feet <lb/>
high on the one hand, and potato and onion orchards <lb/>
on the other; next, you are on a hilltop, with the <lb/>
ocean and the islands spread around you; presently the <lb/>
road winds through a deep cut, shut in by perpendicu- <lb/>
lar walls thirty or forty feet high, marked with the odd- <lb/>
est and abruptest stratum lines, suggestive of sudden <lb/>
and eccentric old upheavals, and garnished with here <lb/>
and there a clinging adventurous flower, and here and <lb/>
there a dangling vine; and by and by your way is along <lb/>
the sea edge, and you may look down a fathom or two <lb/>
through the transparent water and watch the diamond- <lb/>
like flash and play of the light upon the rocks and sands <lb/>
on the bottom until you are tired of it&#x2014;if you are so <lb/>
constituted as to be able to get tired of it.</p>
<p>You may march the country roads in maiden medita- <lb/>
tion, fancy free, by field and farm, for no dog will <lb/>
plunge out at you from unsuspected gate, with breath- <lb/>
taking surprise of ferocious bark, notwithstanding it is <lb/>
a Christian land and a civilized. We saw upwards of a <lb/>
million cats in Bermuda, but the people are very ab- <lb/>
stemious in the matter of dogs. Two or three nights <lb/>
we prowled the country far and wide, and never once <lb/>
were accosted by a dog. It is a great privilege to visit <lb/>
such a land. The cats were no offense when properly <lb/>
distributed, but when piled they obstructed travel.</p>
<p>As we entered the edge of the town that Sunday <lb/>
afternoon, we stopped at a cottage to get a drink of <lb/>
water. The proprietor, a middle-aged man with a <lb/>
good face, asked us to sit down and rest. His dame <lb/>
brought chairs, and we grouped ourselves in the shade <lb/>
of the trees by the door. Mr. Smith&#x2014;that was not <lb/>
his name, but it will answer&#x2014;questioned us about our- <lb/>
selves and our country, and we answered him truthfully, <lb/>
<pb n="287"/>
as a general thing, and questioned him in return. It <lb/>
was all very simple and pleasant and sociable. Rural, <lb/>
too; for there was a pig and a small donkey and a hen <lb/>
anchored out, close at hand, by cords to their legs, on <lb/>
a spot that purported to be grassy. Presently, a <lb/>
woman passed along, and although she coldly said noth- <lb/>
ing she changed the drift of our talk. Said Smith:</p>
<p>"She didn't look this way, you noticed? Well, she <lb/>
is our next neighbor on one side, and there's another <lb/>
family that's our next neighbors on the other side; but <lb/>
there's a general coolness all around now, and we don't <lb/>
speak. Yet these three families, one generation and <lb/>
another, have lived here side by side and been as <lb/>
friendly as weavers for a hundred and fifty years, till <lb/>
about a year ago."</p>
<p>"Why, what calamity could have been powerful <lb/>
enough to break up so old a friendship?"</p>
<p>"Well, it was too bad, but it couldn't be helped. It <lb/>
happened like this: About a year or more ago, the <lb/>
rats got to pestering my place a good deal, and I set up <lb/>
a steel trap in my back-yard. Both of these neighbors <lb/>
run considerable to cats, and so I warned them about <lb/>
the trap, because their cats were pretty sociable around <lb/>
here nights, and they might get into trouble without my <lb/>
intending it. Well, they shut up their cats for a while, <lb/>
but you know how it is with people; they got careless, <lb/>
and sure enough one night the trap took Mrs. Jones's <lb/>
principal tomcat into camp and finished him up. In <lb/>
the morning Mrs. Jones comes here with the corpse in <lb/>
her arms, and cries and takes on the same as if it was a <lb/>
child. It was a cat by the name of Yelverton&#x2014;Hector <lb/>
G. Yelverton&#x2014;a troublesome old rip, with no more <lb/>
principle than an Injun, though you couldn't make <i>her</i> <lb/>
believe it. I said all a man could to comfort her, but <lb/>
no, nothing would do but I must pay for him. Finally, <lb/>
I said I warn't investing in cats now as much as I was, <lb/>
<pb n="288"/>
and with that she walked off in a huff, carrying the re- <lb/>
mains with her. That closed our intercourse with the <lb/>
Joneses. Mrs. Jones joined another church and took <lb/>
her tribe with her. She said she would not hold fellow- <lb/>
ship with assassins. Well, by and by comes Mrs. <lb/>
Brown's turn&#x2014;she that went by here a minute ago. <lb/>
She had a disgraceful old yellow cat that she thought as <lb/>
much of as if he was twins, and one night he tried that <lb/>
trap on his neck, and it fitted him so, and was so sort <lb/>
of satisfactory, that he laid down and curled up and <lb/>
stayed with it. Such was the end of Sir John <lb/>
Baldwin."</p>
<p>"Was that the name of the cat?"</p>
<p>"The same. There's cats around here with names <lb/>
that would surprise you. Maria" (to his wife), <lb/>
"what was that cat's name that eat a keg of ratsbane <lb/>
by mistake over at Hooper's, and started home and got <lb/>
struck by lightning and took the blind staggers and fell <lb/>
in the well and was most drowned before they could <lb/>
fish him out?"</p>
<p>"That was that colored Deacon Jackson's cat. I <lb/>
only remember the last end of its name, which was <lb/>
Hold-The-Fort-For-I-Am-Coming Jackson."</p>
<p>"Sho! that ain't the one. That's the one that eat <lb/>
up an entire box of Seidlitz powders, and then hadn't <lb/>
any more judgment than to go and take a drink. He <lb/>
was considered to be a great loss, but I never could see <lb/>
it. Well, no matter about the names. Mrs. Brown <lb/>
wanted to be reasonable, but Mrs. Jones wouldn't let <lb/>
her. She put her up to going to law for damages. So <lb/>
to law she went, and had the face to claim seven shil- <lb/>
lings and sixpence. It made a great stir. All the <lb/>
neighbors went to court. Everybody took sides. It <lb/>
got hotter and hotter, and broke up all the friendships <lb/>
for three hundred yards around&#x2014;friendships that had <lb/>
lasted for generations and generations.</p>
<pb n="289"/>
<p>"Well, I proved by eleven witnesses that the cat was <lb/>
of a low character and very ornery, and warn't worth <lb/>
a canceled postage-stamp, anyway, taking the average <lb/>
of cats here; but I lost the case. What could I ex- <lb/>
pect? The system is all wrong here, and is bound to <lb/>
make revolution and bloodshed some day. You see, <lb/>
they give the magistrate a poor little starvation salary, <lb/>
and then turn him loose on the public to gouge for fees <lb/>
and costs to live on. What is the natural result? <lb/>
Why, he never looks into the justice of a case&#x2014;never <lb/>
once. All he looks at is which client has got the <lb/>
money. So this one piled the fees and costs and every- <lb/>
thing on to me. I could pay specie, don't you see? <lb/>
and he knew mighty well that if he put the verdict <lb/>
on to Mrs. Brown, where it belonged, he'd have to take <lb/>
his swag in currency."</p>
<p>"Currency? Why, has Bermuda a currency?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;onions. And they were forty per cent. <lb/>
discount, too, then, because the season had been over <lb/>
as much as three months. So I lost my case. I had <lb/>
to pay for that cat. But the general trouble the case <lb/>
made was the worst thing about it. Broke up so much <lb/>
good feeling. The neighbors don't speak to each other <lb/>
now. Mrs. Brown had named a child after me. But <lb/>
she changed its name right away. She is a Baptist. <lb/>
Well, in the course of baptizing it over again, it got <lb/>
drowned. I was hoping we might get to be friendly <lb/>
again some time or other, but of course this drowning <lb/>
the child knocked that all out of the question. It <lb/>
would have saved a world of heart-break and ill blood <lb/>
if she had named it dry."</p>
<p>I knew by the sigh that this was honest. All this <lb/>
trouble and all this destruction of confidence in the <lb/>
purity of the bench on account of a seven-shilling law- <lb/>
suit about a cat! Somehow, it seemed to "size" the <lb/>
country.</p>
<pb n="290"/>
<p>At this point we observed that an English flag had <lb/>
just been placed at half-mast on a building a hundred <lb/>
yards away. I and my friends were busy in an instant <lb/>
trying to imagine whose death, among the island dig- <lb/>
nitaries, could command such a mark of respect as this. <lb/>
Then a shudder shook them and me at the same <lb/>
moment, and I knew that we had jumped to one and <lb/>
the same conclusion: "The governor has gone to <lb/>
England; it is for the British admiral!"</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. Smith noticed the flag. He <lb/>
said with emotion:</p>
<p>"That's on a boarding-house. I judge there's a <lb/>
boarder dead."</p>
<p>A dozen other flags within view went to half-mast.</p>
<p>"It's a boarder, sure," said Smith.</p>
<p>"But would they half-mast the flags here for a <lb/>
boarder, Mr. Smith?"</p>
<p>"Why, certainly they would, if he was <i>dead</i>."</p>
<p>That seemed to size the country again.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="IV">
<head><b>IV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> early twilight of a Sunday evening in Hamilton, <lb/>
Bermuda, is an alluring time. There is just enough of <lb/>
whispering breeze, fragrance of flowers, and sense of <lb/>
repose to raise one's thoughts heavenward; and just <lb/>
enough amateur piano music to keep him reminded of <lb/>
the other place. There are many venerable pianos in <lb/>
Hamilton, and they all play at twilight. Age enlarges <lb/>
and enriches the powers of some musical instruments <lb/>
&#x2014;notably those of the violin&#x2014;but it seems to set a <lb/>
piano's teeth on edge. Most of the music in vogue <lb/>
there is the same that those pianos prattled in their in- <lb/>
nocent infancy; and there is something very pathetic <lb/>
<pb n="291"/>
about it when they go over it now, in their asthmatic <lb/>
second childhood, dropping a note here and there, <lb/>
where a tooth is gone.</p>
<p>We attended evening service at the stately Episcopal <lb/>
church on the hill, where were five or six hundred <lb/>
people, half of them white and the other half black, <lb/>
according to the usual Bermudian proportions; and all <lb/>
well dressed&#x2014;a thing which is also usual in Bermuda <lb/>
and to be confidently expected. There was good <lb/>
music, which we heard, and doubtless a good sermon, <lb/>
but there was a wonderful deal of coughing, and so <lb/>
only the high parts of the argument carried over it. <lb/>
As we came out, after service, I overheard one young <lb/>
girl says to another:</p>
<p>"Why, you don't mean to say you pay duty on <lb/>
gloves and laces! I only pay postage; have them <lb/>
done up and sent in the Boston <i>Advertiser</i>."</p>
<p>There are those that believe that the most difficult <lb/>
thing to create is a woman who can comprehend that it <lb/>
is wrong to smuggle; and that an impossible thing to <lb/>
create is a woman who will not smuggle, whether or <lb/>
no, when she gets a chance. But these may be errors.</p>
<p>We went wandering off toward the country, and were <lb/>
soon far down in the lonely black depths of a road that <lb/>
was roofed over with the dense foliage of a double rank <lb/>
of great cedars. There was no sound of any kind <lb/>
there, it was perfectly still. And it was so dark that <lb/>
one could detect nothing but somber outlines. We <lb/>
strode farther and farther down this tunnel, cheering <lb/>
the way with chat.</p>
<p>Presently the chat took this shape: "How insensibly <lb/>
the character of the people and of a government makes <lb/>
its impress upon a stranger, and gives him a sense of <lb/>
security or of insecurity without his taking deliberate <lb/>
thought upon the matter or asking anybody a question! <lb/>
We have been in this land half a day; we have seen <lb/>
<pb n="292"/>
none but honest faces; we have noted the British flag <lb/>
flying, which means efficient government and good <lb/>
order; so without inquiry we plunge unarmed and with <lb/>
perfect confidence into this dismal place, which in <lb/>
almost any other country would swarm with thugs and <lb/>
garroters&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Sh! What was that? Stealthy footsteps! Low <lb/>
voices! We gasp, we close up together, and wait. <lb/>
A vague shape glides out of the dusk and confronts us. <lb/>
A voice speaks&#x2014;demands money!</p>
<p>"A shilling, gentlemen, if you please, to help build <lb/>
the new Methodist church."</p>
<p>Blessed sound! Holy sound! We contribute with <lb/>
thankful avidity to the new Methodist church, and are <lb/>
happy to think how lucky it was that those little colored <lb/>
Sunday-school scholars did not seize upon everything <lb/>
we had with violence, before we recovered from our <lb/>
momentary helpless condition. By the light of cigars <lb/>
we write down the names of weightier philanthropists <lb/>
than ourselves on the contribution cards, and then pass <lb/>
on into the farther darkness, saying, What sort of a <lb/>
government do they call this, where they allow little <lb/>
black pious children, with contribution cards, to plunge <lb/>
out upon peaceable strangers in the dark and scare <lb/>
them to death?</p>
<p>We prowled on several hours, sometimes by the sea <lb/>
side, sometimes inland, and finally managed to get lost, <lb/>
which is a feat that requires talent in Bermuda. I had <lb/>
on new shoes. They were No. 7's when I started, but <lb/>
were not more than 5's now, and still diminishing. I <lb/>
walked two hours in those shoes after that, before we <lb/>
reached home. Doubtless I could have the reader's <lb/>
sympathy for the asking. Many people have never had <lb/>
the headache or the toothache, and I am one of those <lb/>
myself; but everybody has worn tight shoes for two or <lb/>
three hours, and known the luxury of taking them off <lb/>
<pb n="293"/>
in a retired place and seeing his feet swell up and ob- <lb/>
secure the firmament. Once when I was a callow, bash- <lb/>
ful cub, I took a plain, unsentimental country girl to a <lb/>
comedy one night. I had known her a day; she <lb/>
seemed divine; I wore my new boots. At the end of <lb/>
the first half-hour she said, "Why do you fidget so <lb/>
with your feet?" I said, "Did I?" Then I put my <lb/>
attention there and kept still. At the end of another <lb/>
half-hour she said, "Why do you say, 'Yes, oh yes!' <lb/>
and 'Ha, ha, oh, certainly! very true!' to everything <lb/>
I say, when half the time those are entirely irrelevant <lb/>
answers?" I blushed, and explained that I had been a <lb/>
little absent-minded. At the end of another half-hour <lb/>
she said, "Please, why do you grin so steadfastly at <lb/>
vacancy, and yet look so sad?" I explained that I <lb/>
always did that when I was reflecting. An hour passed, <lb/>
and then she turned and contemplated me with her <lb/>
earnest eyes and said, "Why do you cry all the time?" <lb/>
I explained that very funny comedies always made me <lb/>
cry. At last human nature surrendered, and I secretly <lb/>
slipped my boots off. This was a mistake. I was not <lb/>
able to get them on any more. It was a rainy night; <lb/>
there were no omnibuses going our way; and as I <lb/>
walked home, burning up with shame, with the girl on <lb/>
one arm and my boots under the other, I was an object <lb/>
worthy of some compassion&#x2014;especially in those <lb/>
moments of martyrdom when I had to pass through <lb/>
the glare that fell upon the pavement from street <lb/>
lamps. Finally, this child of the forest said, "Where <lb/>
are your boots?" and being taken unprepared, I put a <lb/>
fitting finish to the follies of the evening with the stupid <lb/>
remark, "The higher classes do not wear them to the <lb/>
theater."</p>
<p>The Reverend had been an army chaplain during the <lb/>
war, and while we were hunting for a road that would <lb/>
<pb n="294"/>
lead to Hamilton he told a story about two dying soldiers <lb/>
which interested me in spite of my feet. He said that <lb/>
in the Potomac hospitals rough pine coffins were fur- <lb/>
nished by government, but that it was not always pos- <lb/>
sible to keep up with the demand; so, when a man <lb/>
died, if there was no coffin at hand he was buried with- <lb/>
out one. One night, late, two soldiers lay dying in a <lb/>
ward. A man came in with a coffin on his shoulder, <lb/>
and stood trying to make up his mind which of these <lb/>
two poor fellows would be likely to need it first. Both <lb/>
of them begged for it with their fading eyes&#x2014;they <lb/>
were past talking. Then one of them protruded a <lb/>
wasted hand from his blankets and made a feeble beck- <lb/>
oning sign with the fingers, to signify, "Be a good fel- <lb/>
low; put it under my bed, please." The man did it, <lb/>
and left. The lucky soldier painfully turned himself in <lb/>
his bed until he faced the other warrior, raised himself <lb/>
partly on his elbow, and began to work up a mysterious <lb/>
expression of some kind in his face. Gradually, irk- <lb/>
somely, but surely and steadily, it developed, and at <lb/>
last it took definite form as a pretty successful <i>wink</i>. <lb/>
The sufferer fell back exhausted with his labor, but <lb/>
bathed in glory. Now entered a personal friend of <lb/>
No. 2, the despoiled soldier. No. 2 pleaded with him <lb/>
with eloquent eyes, till presently he understood, and re- <lb/>
moved the coffin from under No. 1's bed and put it <lb/>
under No. 2's. No. 2 indicated his joy, and made <lb/>
some more signs; the friend understood again, and put <lb/>
his arm under No. 2's shoulders and lifted him partly <lb/>
up. Then the dying hero turned the dim exultation of <lb/>
his eye upon No. 1, and began a slow and labored <lb/>
work with his hands; gradually he lifted one hand up <lb/>
toward his face; it grew weak and dropped back again; <lb/>
once more he made the effort, but failed again. He <lb/>
took a rest; he gathered all the remnant of his strength, <lb/>
and this time he slowly but surely carried his thumb to <lb/>
<pb n="295"/>
the side of his nose, spread the gaunt fingers wide in <lb/>
triumph, and dropped back dead. That picture sticks <lb/>
by me yet. The "situation" is unique.</p>
<p>The next morning, at what seemed a very early hour, <lb/>
the little white table-waiter appeared suddenly in my <lb/>
room and shot a single word out of himself: "Break- <lb/>
fast!"</p>
<p>This was a remarkable boy in many ways. He was <lb/>
about eleven years old; he had alert, intent black eyes; <lb/>
he was quick of movement; there was no hesitation, <lb/>
no uncertainty about him anywhere; there was a mili- <lb/>
tary decision in his lip, his manner, his speech, that <lb/>
was an astonishing thing to see in a little chap like him; <lb/>
he wasted no words; his answers always came so quick <lb/>
and brief that they seemed to be part of the question <lb/>
that had been asked instead of a reply to it. When he <lb/>
stood at table with his fly-brush, rigid, erect, his face <lb/>
set in a cast-iron gravity, he was a statue till he detected <lb/>
a dawning want in somebody's eye; then he pounced <lb/>
down, supplied it, and was instantly a statue again. <lb/>
When he was sent to the kitchen for anything, he <lb/>
marched upright till he got to the door; he turned <lb/>
hand-springs the rest of the way.</p>
<p>"Breakfast!"</p>
<p>I thought I would make one more effort to get some <lb/>
conversation out of this being.</p>
<p>"Have you called the Reverend, or are&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Yes s'r!"</p>
<p>"Is it early, or is&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Eight-five."</p>
<p>"Do you have to do all the 'chores,' or is there <lb/>
somebody to give you a&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Colored girl."</p>
<p>"Is there only one parish in this island, or are <lb/>
there&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Eight!"</p>
<pb n="296"/>
<p>"Is the big church on the hill a parish church, or is <lb/>
it&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Chapel-of-ease!"</p>
<p>"Is taxation here classified into poll, parish, town, <lb/>
and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Don't know!"</p>
<p>Before I could cudgel another question out of my <lb/>
head, he was below, hand-springing across the back- <lb/>
yard. He had slid down the balusters, head-first. I <lb/>
gave up trying to provoke a discussion with him. The <lb/>
essential element of discussion had been left out of <lb/>
him; his answers were so final and exact that they did <lb/>
not leave a doubt to hang conversation on. I suspect <lb/>
that there is the making of a mighty man or a mighty <lb/>
rascal in this boy&#x2014;according to circumstances&#x2014;but <lb/>
they are going to apprentice him to a carpenter. It is <lb/>
the way the world uses its opportunities.</p>
<p>During this day and the next we took carriage drives <lb/>
about the island and over to the town of St. George's, <lb/>
fifteen or twenty miles away. Such hard, excellent <lb/>
roads to drive over are not to be found elsewhere out <lb/>
of Europe. An intelligent young colored man drove <lb/>
us, and acted as guide-book. In the edge of the town <lb/>
we saw five or six mountain-cabbage palms (atrocious <lb/>
name!) standing in a straight row, and equidistant <lb/>
from each other. These were not the largest or the <lb/>
tallest trees I have ever seen, but they were the state- <lb/>
liest, the most majestic. That row of them must be <lb/>
the nearest that nature has ever come to counterfeiting <lb/>
a colonnade. These trees are all the same height, say <lb/>
sixty feet; the trunks as gray as granite, with a very <lb/>
gradual and perfect taper; without sign of branch or <lb/>
knot or flaw; the surface not looking like bark, but like <lb/>
granite that has been dressed and not polished. Thus all <lb/>
the way up the diminishing shaft for fifty feet; then it <lb/>
begins to take the appearance of being closely wrapped, <lb/>
<pb n="297"/>
spool-fashion, with gray cord, or of having been turned <lb/>
in a lathe. Above this point there is an outward swell, <lb/>
and thence upwards, for six feet or more, the cylinder <lb/>
is a bright, fresh green, and is formed of wrappings <lb/>
like those of an ear of green Indian corn. Then comes <lb/>
the great, spraying palm plume, also green. Other <lb/>
palm trees always lean out of the perpendicular, or <lb/>
have a curve in them. But the plumb-line could not <lb/>
detect a deflection in any individual of this stately <lb/>
row; they stand as straight as the colonnade of Baal- <lb/>
bec; they have its great height, they have its grace- <lb/>
fulness, they have its dignity; in moonlight or twilight, <lb/>
and shorn of their plumes, they would duplicate it.</p>
<p>The birds we came across in the country were singu- <lb/>
larly tame; even that wild creature, the quail, would <lb/>
pick around in the grass at ease while we inspected it <lb/>
and talked about it at leisure. A small bird of the <lb/>
canary species had to be stirred up with the butt-end <lb/>
of the whip before it would move, and then it moved <lb/>
only a couple of feet. It is said that even the sus- <lb/>
picious flea is tame and sociable in Bermuda, and will <lb/>
allow himself to be caught and caressed without misgiv- <lb/>
ings. This should be taken with allowance, for doubt- <lb/>
less there is more or less brag about it. In San Fran- <lb/>
cisco they used to claim that their native flea could kick <lb/>
a child over, as if it were a merit in a flea to be able to <lb/>
do that; as if the knowledge of it trumpeted abroad <lb/>
ought to entice immigration. Such a thing in nine <lb/>
cases out of ten would be almost sure to deter a think- <lb/>
ing man from coming.</p>
<p>We saw no bugs or reptiles to speak of, and so I was <lb/>
thinking of saying in print, in a general way, that there <lb/>
were none at all; but one night after I had gone to bed, <lb/>
the Reverend came into my room carrying something, <lb/>
and asked, "Is this your boot?" I said it was, and <lb/>
he said he had met a spider going off with it. Next <lb/>
<pb n="298"/>
morning he stated that just at dawn the same spider <lb/>
raised his window and was coming in to get a shirt, but <lb/>
saw him and fled.</p>
<p>I inquired, "Did he get the shirt?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"How did you know it was a shirt he was after?"</p>
<p>"I could see it in his eye."</p>
<p>We inquired around, but could hear of no Bermu- <lb/>
dian spider capable of doing these things. Citizens <lb/>
said that their largest spiders could not more than <lb/>
spread their legs over an ordinary saucer, and that they <lb/>
had always been considered honest. Here was testi- <lb/>
mony of a clergyman against the testimony of mere <lb/>
worldings&#x2014;interested ones, too. On the whole, I <lb/>
judged it best to lock up my things.</p>
<p>Here and there on the country roads we found lemon, <lb/>
papaw, orange, lime, and fig trees; also several sorts <lb/>
of palms, among them the cocoa, the date, and the <lb/>
palmetto. We saw some bamboos forty feet high, with <lb/>
stems as thick as a man's arm. Jungles of the man- <lb/>
grove-tree stood up out of swamps, propped on their <lb/>
interlacing roots as upon a tangle of stilts. In drier <lb/>
places the noble tamarind sent down its grateful cloud <lb/>
of shade. Here and there the blossomy tamarisk <lb/>
adorned the roadside. There was a curious gnarled <lb/>
and twisted black tree, without a single leaf on it. It <lb/>
might have passed itself off for a dead apple tree but <lb/>
for the fact that it had a star-like, red-hot flower <lb/>
sprinkled sparsely over its person. It had the scattery <lb/>
red glow that a constellation might have when glimpsed <lb/>
through smoked glass. It is possible that our constel- <lb/>
lations have been so constructed as to be invisible <lb/>
through smoked glass; if this is so it is a great mistake.</p>
<p>We saw a tree that bears grapes, and just as calmly <lb/>
and unostentatiously as a vine would do it. We saw <lb/>
an India-rubber-tree, but out of season, possibly, so <lb/>
<pb n="299"/>
there were no shoes on it, nor suspenders, nor any- <lb/>
thing that a person would properly expect to find there. <lb/>
This gave it an impressively fraudulent look. There <lb/>
was exactly one mahogany tree on the island. I know <lb/>
this to be reliable, because I saw a man who said he <lb/>
had counted it many a time and could not be mistaken. <lb/>
He was a man with a harelip and a pure heart, and <lb/>
everybody said he was as true as steel. Such men are <lb/>
all too few.</p>
<p>One's eye caught near and far the pink cloud of the <lb/>
oleander and the red blaze of the pomegranate blossom. <lb/>
In one piece of wild wood the morning-glory vines <lb/>
had wrapped the trees to their very tops, and decorated <lb/>
them all over with couples and clusters of great blue <lb/>
bells&#x2014;a fine and striking spectacle, at a little distance. <lb/>
But the dull cedar is everywhere, and is the prevail- <lb/>
ing foliage. One does not appreciate how dull it is <lb/>
until the varnished, bright green attire of the infrequent <lb/>
lemon tree pleasantly intrudes its contrast. In one <lb/>
thing Bermuda is eminently tropical&#x2014;was in May, at <lb/>
least&#x2014;the unbrilliant, slightly faded, unrejoicing look <lb/>
of the landscape. For forests arrayed in a blemishless <lb/>
magnificence of glowing green foliage that seems to <lb/>
exult in its own existence and can move the beholder <lb/>
to an enthusiasm that will make him either shout or <lb/>
cry, one must go to countries that have malignant <lb/>
winters.</p>
<p>We saw scores of colored farmers digging their crops <lb/>
of potatoes and onions, their wives and children help- <lb/>
ing&#x2014;entirely contented and comfortable, if looks go <lb/>
for anything. We never met a man, or woman, or <lb/>
child anywhere in this sunny island who seemed to be <lb/>
unprosperous, or discontented, or sorry about anything. <lb/>
This sort of monotony became very tiresome presently, <lb/>
and even something worse. The spectacle of an entire <lb/>
nation groveling in contentment is an infuriating thing. <lb/>
<pb n="300"/>
We felt the lack of something in this community&#x2014;a <lb/>
vague, an undefinable, an elusive something, and yet <lb/>
a lack. But after considerable thought we made out <lb/>
what it was&#x2014;tramps. Let them go there, right now, <lb/>
in a body. It is utterly virgin soil. Passage is cheap. <lb/>
Every true patriot in America will help buy tickets. <lb/>
Whole armies of these excellent beings can be spared <lb/>
from our midst and our polls; they will find a delicious <lb/>
climate and a green, kind-hearted people. There are <lb/>
potatoes and onions for all, and a generous welcome <lb/>
for the first batch that arrives, and elegant graves for <lb/>
the second.</p>
<p>It was the Early Rose potato the people were dig- <lb/>
ging. Later in the year they have another crop, which <lb/>
they call the Garnet. We buy their potatoes (retail) <lb/>
at fifteen dollars a barrel; and those colored farmers <lb/>
buy ours for a song, and live on them. Havana might <lb/>
exchange cigars with Connecticut in the same ad- <lb/>
vantageous way, if she thought of it.</p>
<p>We passed a roadside grocery with a sign up, "Pota- <lb/>
toes Wanted." An ignorant stranger, doubtless. He <lb/>
could not have gone thirty steps from his place without <lb/>
finding plenty of them.</p>
<p>In several fields the arrowroot crop was already <lb/>
sprouting. Bermuda used to make a vast annual <lb/>
profit out of this staple before firearms came into such <lb/>
general use.</p>
<p>The island is not large. Somewhere in the interior a <lb/>
man ahead of us had a very slow horse. I suggested <lb/>
that we had better go by him; but the driver said the <lb/>
man had but a little way to go. I waited to see, <lb/>
wondering how he could know. Presently the man did <lb/>
turn down another road. I asked, "How did you <lb/>
know he would?"</p>
<p>"Because I knew the man, and where he lived."</p>
<p>I asked him, satirically, if he knew everybody in the <lb/>
<pb n="301"/>
island; he answered, very simply, that he did. This <lb/>
gives a body's mind a good substantial grip on the <lb/>
dimensions of the place.</p>
<p>At the principal hotel at St. George's, a young girl, <lb/>
with a sweet, serious face, said we could not be fur- <lb/>
nished with dinner, because we had not been expected, <lb/>
and no preparation had been made. Yet it was still an <lb/>
hour before dinner time. We argued, she yielded not; <lb/>
we supplicated, she was serene. The hotel had not <lb/>
been expecting an inundation of two people, and so it <lb/>
seemed that we should have to go home dinnerless. I <lb/>
said we were not very hungry; a fish would do. My <lb/>
little maid answered, it was not the market day for fish. <lb/>
Things began to look serious; but presently the boarder <lb/>
who sustained the hotel came in, and when the case <lb/>
was laid before him he was cheerfully willing to divide. <lb/>
So we had much pleasant chat at table about St. <lb/>
George's chief industry, the repairing of damaged <lb/>
ships; and in between we had a soup that had some- <lb/>
thing in it that seemed to taste like the hereafter, but it <lb/>
proved to be only pepper of a particularly vivacious <lb/>
kind. And we had an iron-clad chicken that was de- <lb/>
liciously cooked, but not in the right way. Baking was <lb/>
not the thing to convince his sort. He ought to have <lb/>
been put through a quartz mill until the "tuck" was <lb/>
taken out of him, and then boiled till we came again. <lb/>
We got a good deal of sport out of him, but not enough <lb/>
sustenance to leave the victory on our side. No mat- <lb/>
ter; we had potatoes and a pie and a sociable good <lb/>
time. Then a ramble through the town, which is a <lb/>
quaint one, with interesting, crooked streets, and nar- <lb/>
row, crooked lanes, with here and there a grain of dust. <lb/>
Here, as in Hamilton, the dwellings had Venetian <lb/>
blinds of a very sensible pattern. They were not <lb/>
double shutters, hinged at the sides, but a single broad <lb/>
shutter, hinged at the top; you push it outward, from <lb/>
<pb n="302"/>
the bottom, and fasten it at any angle required by the <lb/>
sun or desired by yourself.</p>
<p>All about the island one sees great white scars on the <lb/>
hill-slopes. These are dished spaces where the soil has <lb/>
been scraped off and the coral exposed and glazed with <lb/>
hard whitewash. Some of these are a quarter-acre in <lb/>
size. They catch and carry the rainfall to reservoirs; <lb/>
for the wells are few and poor, and there are no natural <lb/>
springs and no brooks.</p>
<p>They say that the Bermuda climate is mild and <lb/>
equable, with never any snow or ice, and that one <lb/>
may be very comfortable in spring clothing the year <lb/>
round, there. We had delightful and decided summer <lb/>
weather in May, with a flaming sun that permitted the <lb/>
thinnest of raiment, and yet there was a constant <lb/>
breeze; consequently we were never discomforted by <lb/>
heat. At four or five in the afternoon the mercury <lb/>
began to go down, and then it became necessary to <lb/>
change to thick garments. I went to St. George's in the <lb/>
morning clothed in the thinnest of linen, and reached <lb/>
home at five in the afternoon with two overcoats on. <lb/>
The nights are said to be always cool and bracing. <lb/>
We had mosquito nets, and the Reverend said the <lb/>
mosquitoes persecuted him a good deal. I often heard <lb/>
him slapping and banging at these imaginary creatures <lb/>
with as much zeal as if they had been real. There are <lb/>
no mosquitoes in the Bermudas in May.</p>
<p>The poet Thomas Moore spent several months in <lb/>
Bermuda more than seventy years ago. He was sent <lb/>
out to be registrar of the admiralty. I am not quite <lb/>
clear as to the function of a registrar of the admiralty <lb/>
of Bermuda, but I think it is his duty to keep a record <lb/>
of all the admirals born there. I will inquire into this. <lb/>
There was not much doing in admirals, and Moore got <lb/>
tired and went away. A reverently preserved souvenir <lb/>
of him is still one of the treasures of the islands. I <lb/>
<pb n="303"/>
gathered the idea, vaguely, that it was a jug, but was <lb/>
persistently thwarted in the twenty-two efforts I made <lb/>
to visit it. However, it was no matter, for I found out <lb/>
afterwards that it was only a chair.</p>
<p>There are several "sights" in the Bermudas, of <lb/>
course, but they are easily avoided. This is a great <lb/>
advantage&#x2014;one cannot have it in Europe. Bermuda <lb/>
is the right country for a jaded man to "loaf" in. <lb/>
There are no harassments; the deep peace and quiet of <lb/>
the country sink into one's body and bones and give <lb/>
his conscience a rest, and chloroform the legion of in- <lb/>
visible small devils that are always trying to whitewash <lb/>
his hair. A good many Americans go there about the <lb/>
first of March and remain until the early spring weeks <lb/>
have finished their villainies at home.</p>
<p>The Bermudians are hoping soon to have telegraphic <lb/>
communication with the world. But even after they <lb/>
shall have acquired this curse it will still be a good <lb/>
country to go to for a vacation, for there are charming <lb/>
little islets scattered about the enclosed sea where one <lb/>
could live secure from interruption. The telegraph <lb/>
boy would have to come in a boat, and one could easily <lb/>
kill him while he was making his landing.</p>
<p>We had spent four days in Bermuda&#x2014;three bright <lb/>
ones out of doors and one rainy one in the house, we <lb/>
being disappointed about getting a yacht for a sail; <lb/>
and now our furlough was ended, and we entered into <lb/>
the ship again and sailed homeward.</p>
<p>We made the run home to New York quarantine in <lb/>
three days and five hours, and could have gone right <lb/>
along up to the city if we had had a health permit. <lb/>
But health permits are not granted after seven in the <lb/>
evening, partly because a ship cannot be inspected <lb/>
and overhauled with exhaustive thoroughness except in <lb/>
daylight, and partly because health officers are liable <lb/>
to catch cold if they expose themselves to the night <lb/>
<pb n="304"/>
air. Still, you can <i>buy</i> a permit after hours for five <lb/>
dollars extra, and the officer will do the inspecting <lb/>
next week. Our ship and passengers lay under ex- <lb/>
pense and in humiliating captivity all night, under the <lb/>
very nose of the little official reptile who is supposed <lb/>
to protect New York from pestilence by his vigilant <lb/>
"inspections." This imposing rigor gave everybody <lb/>
a solemn and awful idea of the beneficent watchfulness <lb/>
of our government, and there were some who wondered <lb/>
if anything finer could be found in other countries.</p>
<p>In the morning we were all a-tiptoe to witness the <lb/>
intricate ceremony of inspecting the ship. But it was <lb/>
a disappointing thing. The health officer's tug ranged <lb/>
alongside for a moment, our purser handed the lawful <lb/>
three-dollar permit fee to the health officer's bootblack, <lb/>
who passed us a folded paper in a forked stick, and <lb/>
away we went. The entire "inspection" did not oc- <lb/>
cupy thirteen seconds.</p>
<p>The health officer's place is worth a hundred thou- <lb/>
sand dollars a year to him. His system of inspection <lb/>
is perfect, and therefore cannot be improved on; but <lb/>
it seems to me that his system of collecting his fees <lb/>
might be amended. For a great ship to lie idle all <lb/>
night is a most costly loss of time; for her passengers <lb/>
to have to do the same thing works to them the same <lb/>
damage, with the addition of an amount of exaspera- <lb/>
tion and bitterness of soul that the spectacle of that <lb/>
health officer's ashes on a shovel could hardly sweeten. <lb/>
Now why would it not be better and simpler to let the <lb/>
ships pass in unmolested, and the fees and permits be <lb/>
exchanged once a year by post?</p>

<head><b>THE FACTS CONCERNING THE RECENT <lb/>
CARNIVAL OF CRIME IN <lb/>
CONNECTICUT</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>I was</smcap> feeling blithe, almost jocund. I put a match <lb/>
to my cigar, and just then the morning's mail was <lb/>
handed in. The first superscription I glanced at was <lb/>
in a handwriting that sent a thrill of pleasure through <lb/>
and through me. It was Aunt Mary's; and she was <lb/>
the person I loved and honored most in all the world, <lb/>
outside of my own household. She had been my boy- <lb/>
hood's idol; maturity, which is fatal to so many en- <lb/>
chantments, had not been able to dislodge her from <lb/>
her pedestal; no, it had only justified her right to be <lb/>
there, and placed her dethronement permanently among <lb/>
the impossibilities. To show how strong her influence <lb/>
over me was, I will observe that long after everybody <lb/>
else's "<i>do</i>-stop-smoking" had ceased to affect me in <lb/>
the slightest degree, Aunt Mary could still stir my <lb/>
torpid conscience into faint signs of life when she <lb/>
touched upon the matter. But all things have their <lb/>
limit in this world. A happy day came at last, when <lb/>
even Aunt Mary's words could no longer move me. I <lb/>
was not merely glad to see that day arrive; I was more <lb/>
than glad&#x2014;I was grateful; for when its sun had set, <lb/>
the one alloy that was able to mar my enjoyment of <lb/>
my aunt's society was gone. The remainder of her <lb/>
<pb n="306"/>
stay with us that winter was in every way a delight. <lb/>
Of course she pleaded with me just as earnestly as <lb/>
ever, after that blessed day, to quit my pernicious <lb/>
habit, but to no purpose whatever; the moment she <lb/>
opened the subject I at once became calmly, peace- <lb/>
fully, contentedly indifferent&#x2014;absolutely, adamantinely <lb/>
indifferent. Consequently the closing weeks of that <lb/>
memorable visit melted away as pleasantly as a dream, <lb/>
they were so freighted for me with tranquil satisfaction. <lb/>
I could not have enjoyed my pet vice more if my gentle <lb/>
cormentor had been a smoker herself, and an advocate <lb/>
of the practice. Well, the sight of her handwriting <lb/>
reminded me that I was getting very hungry to see her <lb/>
again. I easily guessed what I should find in her <lb/>
letter. I opened it. Good! just as I expected; she <lb/>
was coming! Coming this very day, too, and by the <lb/>
morning train; I might expect her any moment.</p>
<p>I said to myself, "I am thoroughly happy and con- <lb/>
tent now. If my most pitiless enemy could appear <lb/>
before me at this moment, I would freely right any <lb/>
wrong I may have done him."</p>
<p>Straightway the door opened, and a shriveled, <lb/>
shabby dwarf entered. He was not more than two <lb/>
feet high. He seemed to be about forty years old. <lb/>
Every feature and every inch of him was a trifle out of <lb/>
shape; and so, while one could not put his finger <lb/>
upon any particular part and say, "This is a conspicu- <lb/>
ous deformity," the spectator perceived that this little <lb/>
person was a deformity as a whole&#x2014;a vague, general, <lb/>
evenly blended, nicely adjusted deformity. There was <lb/>
a fox-like cunning in the face and the sharp little eyes, <lb/>
and also alertness and malice. And yet, this vile bit of <lb/>
human rubbish seemed to bear a sort of remote and ill- <lb/>
defined resemblance to me! It was dully perceptible <lb/>
in the mean form, the countenance, and even the <lb/>
clothes, gestures, manner, and attitudes of the creature. <lb/>
<pb n="307"/>
He was a far-fetched, dim suggestion of a bu<unclear/> <lb/>
upon me, a caricature of me in little. One thing <unclear/> <lb/>
him struck me forcibly, and most unpleasantly: he w<unclear/> <lb/>
covered all over with a fuzzy, greenish mould, such as <lb/>
one sometimes sees upon mildewed bread. The sight <lb/>
of it was nauseating.</p>
<p>He stepped along with a chipper air, and flung him- <lb/>
self into a doll's chair in a very free-and-easy way, <lb/>
without waiting to be asked. He tossed his hat into <lb/>
the waste-basket. He picked up my old chalk pipe <lb/>
from the floor, gave the stem a wipe or two on his <lb/>
knee, filled the bowl from the tobacco-box at his side, <lb/>
and said to me in a tone of pert command:</p>
<p>"Gimme a match!"</p>
<p>I blushed to the roots of my hair; partly with indig- <lb/>
nation, but mainly because it somehow seemed to me <lb/>
that this whole performance was very like an exaggera- <lb/>
tion of conduct which I myself had sometimes been <lb/>
guilty of in my intercourse with familiar friends&#x2014;but <lb/>
never, never with strangers, I observed to myself. I <lb/>
wanted to kick the pigmy into the fire, but some in- <lb/>
comprehensible sense of being legally and legitimately <lb/>
under his authority forced me to obey his order. He <lb/>
applied the match to the pipe, took a contemplative <lb/>
whiff or two, and remarked, in an irritatingly familiar <lb/>
way:</p>
<p>"Seems to me it's devilish odd weather for this time <lb/>
of year."</p>
<p>I flushed again, and in anger and humiliation as be- <lb/>
fore; for the language was hardly an exaggeration of <lb/>
some that I have uttered in my day, and moreover was <lb/>
delivered in a tone of voice and with an exasperating <lb/>
drawl that had the seeming of a deliberate travesty of <lb/>
my style. Now there is nothing I am quite so sensitive <lb/>
about as a mocking imitation of my drawling infirmity <lb/>
of speech. I spoke up sharply and said:</p>
<pb n="308"/>
<p><unclear/>ok here, you miserable ash-cat! you will have <lb/>
<unclear/>ve a little more attention to your manners, or I will <lb/>
<unclear/>row you out of the window!"</p>
<p>The manikin smiled a smile of malicious content and <lb/>
security, puffed a whiff of smoke contemptuously <lb/>
toward me, and said, with a still more elaborate drawl:</p>
<p>"Come&#x2014;go gently now; don't put on <i>too</i> many <lb/>
airs with your betters."</p>
<p>This cool snub rasped me all over, but it seemed to <lb/>
subjugate me, too, for a moment. The pigmy con- <lb/>
templated me awhile with his weasel eyes, and then <lb/>
said, in a peculiarly sneering way:</p>
<p>"You turned a tramp away from your door this <lb/>
morning."</p>
<p>I said crustily:</p>
<p>"Perhaps I did, perhaps I didn't. How do <i>you</i> <lb/>
know?"</p>
<p>"Well, I know. It isn't any matter <i>how</i> I know."</p>
<p>"Very well. Suppose I <i>did</i> turn a tramp away from <lb/>
the door&#x2014;what of it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing; nothing in particular. Only you lied <lb/>
to him."</p>
<p>"I <i>didn't!</i> That is, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Yes, but you did; you lied to him."</p>
<p>I felt a guilty pang&#x2014;in truth, I had felt it forty <lb/>
times before that tramp had traveled a block from my <lb/>
door&#x2014;but still I resolved to make a show of feeling <lb/>
slandered; so I said:</p>
<p>"This is a baseless impertinence. I said to the <lb/>
tramp&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;wait. You were about to lie again. <i>I</i> <lb/>
know what you said to him. You said the cook was <lb/>
gone down town and there was nothing left from break- <lb/>
fast. Two lies. You knew the cook was behind the <lb/>
door, and plenty of provisions behind <i>her</i>."</p>
<p>This astonishing accuracy silenced me; and it filled <lb/>
<pb n="309"/>
me with wondering speculations, too, as to how this <lb/>
cub could have got his information. Of course he <lb/>
could have culled the conversation from the tramp, but <lb/>
by what sort of magic had he contrived to find out <lb/>
about the concealed cook? Now the dwarf spoke <lb/>
again:</p>
<p>"It was rather pitiful, rather small, in you to refuse <lb/>
to read that poor young woman's manuscript the other <lb/>
day, and give her an opinion as to its literary value; <lb/>
and she had come so far, too, and <i>so</i> hopefully. Now <lb/>
<i>wasn't</i> it?"</p>
<p>I felt like a cur! And I had felt so every time the <lb/>
thing had recurred to my mind, I may as well confess. <lb/>
I flushed hotly and said:</p>
<p>"Look here, have you nothing better to do than <lb/>
prowl around prying into other people's business? <lb/>
Did that girl tell you that?"</p>
<p>"Never mind whether she did or not. The main <lb/>
thing is, you did that contemptible thing. And you <lb/>
felt ashamed of it afterward. Aha! you feel ashamed <lb/>
of it <i>now!</i>"</p>
<p>This was a sort of devilish glee. With fiery earnest- <lb/>
ness I responded:</p>
<p>"I told that girl, in the kindest, gentlest way, that I <lb/>
could not consent to deliver judgment upon <i>any</i> one's <lb/>
manuscript, because an individual's verdict was worth- <lb/>
less. It might underrate a work of high merit and lose <lb/>
it to the world, or it might overrate a trashy production <lb/>
and so open the way for its infliction upon the world. <lb/>
I said that the great public was the only tribunal com- <lb/>
petent to sit in judgment upon a literary effort, and <lb/>
therefore it must be best to lay it before that tribunal <lb/>
in the outset, since in the end it must stand or fall by <lb/>
that mighty court's decision anyway."</p>
<p>"Yes, you said all that. So you did, you juggling, <lb/>
small-souled shuffler! And yet when the happy hope- <lb/>
<pb n="310"/>
fulness faded out of that poor girl's face, when you <lb/>
saw her furtively slip beneath her shawl the scroll she <lb/>
had so patiently and honestly scribbled at&#x2014;so ashamed <lb/>
of her darling now, so proud of it before&#x2014;when you <lb/>
saw the gladness go out of her eyes and the tears come <lb/>
there, when she crept away so humbly who had come <lb/>
so&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, peace! peace! peace! Blister your merciless <lb/>
tongue, haven't all these thoughts tortured me enough <lb/>
without <i>your</i> coming here to fetch them back again!"</p>
<p>Remorse! remorse! It seemed to me that it would <lb/>
eat the very heart out of me! And yet that small <lb/>
fiend only sat there leering at me with joy and con- <lb/>
tempt, and placidly chuckling. Presently he began to <lb/>
speak again. Every sentence was an accusation, and <lb/>
every accusation a truth. Every clause was freighted <lb/>
with sarcasm and derision, every slow-dropping word <lb/>
burned like vitriol. The dwarf reminded me of times <lb/>
when I had flown at my children in anger and punished <lb/>
them for faults which a little inquiry would have taught <lb/>
me that others, and not they, had committed. He re- <lb/>
minded me of how I had disloyally allowed old friends <lb/>
to be traduced in my hearing, and been too craven to <lb/>
utter a word in their defense. He reminded me of <lb/>
many dishonest things which I had done; of many <lb/>
which I had procured to be done by children and other <lb/>
irresponsible persons; of some which I had planned, <lb/>
thought upon, and longed to do, and been kept from <lb/>
the performance by fear of consequences only. With <lb/>
exquisite cruelty he recalled to my mind, item by item, <lb/>
wrongs and unkindnesses I had inflicted and humilia- <lb/>
tions I had put upon friends since dead, "who died <lb/>
thinking of those injuries, maybe, and grieving over <lb/>
them," he added, by way of poison to the stab.</p>
<p>"For instance," said he, "take the case of your <lb/>
younger brother, when you two were boys together, <lb/>
<pb n="311"/>
many a long year ago. He always lovingly trusted in <lb/>
you with a fidelity that your manifold treacheries were <lb/>
not able to shake. He followed you about like a dog, <lb/>
content to suffer wrong and abuse if he might only be <lb/>
with you; patient under these injuries so long as it was <lb/>
your hand that inflicted them. The latest picture you <lb/>
have of him in health and strength must be such a <lb/>
comfort to you! You pledged your honor that if he <lb/>
would let you blindfold him no harm should come to <lb/>
him; and then, giggling and choking over the rare fun <lb/>
of the joke, you led him to a brook thinly glazed with <lb/>
ice, and pushed him in; and how you did laugh! <lb/>
Man, you will never forget the gentle, reproachful <lb/>
look he gave you as he struggled shivering out, if you <lb/>
live a thousand years! Oho! you see it now, you see <lb/>
it <i>now!</i>"</p>
<p>"Beast, I have seen it a million times, and shall see <lb/>
it a million more! and may you rot away piecemeal, <lb/>
and suffer till doomsday what I suffer now, for bring- <lb/>
ing it back to me again!"</p>
<p>The dwarf chuckled contentedly, and went on with <lb/>
his accusing history of my career. I dropped into a <lb/>
moody, vengeful state, and suffered in silence under <lb/>
the merciless lash. At last this remark of his gave me <lb/>
a sudden rouse:</p>
<p>"Two months ago, on a Tuesday, you woke up, <lb/>
away in the night, and fell to thinking, with shame, <lb/>
about a peculiarly mean and pitiful act of yours toward <lb/>
a poor ignorant Indian in the wilds of the Rocky <lb/>
Mountains in the winter of eighteen hundred and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Stop a moment, devil! Stop! Do you mean to <lb/>
tell me that even my very <i>thoughts</i> are not hidden from <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>"It seems to look like that. Didn't you think the <lb/>
thoughts I have just mentioned?"</p>
<p>"If I didn't, I wish I may never breathe again! <lb/>
<pb n="312"/>
Look here, friend&#x2014;look me in the eye. Who <i>are</i> <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>"Well, who do you think?"</p>
<p>"I think you are Satan himself. I think you are <lb/>
the devil."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"No? Then who <i>can</i> you be?"</p>
<p>"Would you really like to know?"</p>
<p>"<i>Indeed</i> I would."</p>
<p>"Well, I am your <i>Conscience!</i>"</p>
<p>In an instant I was in a blaze of joy and exultation <lb/>
I sprang at the creature, roaring:</p>
<p>"Curse you, I have wished a hundred million times <lb/>
that you were tangible, and that I could get my hands <lb/>
on your throat once! Oh, but I will wreak a deadly <lb/>
vengeance on&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Folly! Lightning does not move more quickly than <lb/>
my Conscience did! He darted aloft so suddenly that <lb/>
in the moment my fingers clutched the empty air he <lb/>
was already perched on the top of the high bookcase, <lb/>
with his thumb at his nose in token of derision. I <lb/>
flung the poker at him, and missed. I fired the boot- <lb/>
jack. In a blind rage I flew from place to place, and <lb/>
snatched and hurled any missile that came handy; the <lb/>
storm of books, inkstands, and chunks of coal gloomed <lb/>
the air and beat about the manikin's perch relentlessly, <lb/>
but all to no purpose; the nimble figure dodged every <lb/>
shot; and not only that, but burst into a cackle of <lb/>
sarcastic and triumphant laughter as I sat down ex- <lb/>
hausted. While I puffed and gasped with fatigue and <lb/>
excitement, my Conscience talked to this effect:</p>
<p>"My good slave, you are curiously witless&#x2014;no, I <lb/>
mean characteristically so. In truth, you are always <lb/>
consistent, always yourself, always an ass. Otherwise <lb/>
it must have occurred to you that if you attempted this <lb/>
murder with a sad heart and a heavy conscience, I <lb/>
<pb n="313"/>
would droop under the burdening influence instantly. <lb/>
Fool, I should have weighed a ton, and could not have <lb/>
budged from the floor; but instead, you are so cheer- <lb/>
fully anxious to kill me that your conscience is as light <lb/>
as a feather; hence I am away up here out of your <lb/>
reach. I can almost respect a mere ordinary sort of <lb/>
fool; but <i>you</i>&#x2014;pah!"</p>
<p>I would have given anything, then, to be heavy- <lb/>
hearted, so that I could get this person down from <lb/>
there and take his life, but I could no more be heavy- <lb/>
hearted over such a desire than I could have sorrowed <lb/>
over its accomplishment. So I could only look long- <lb/>
ingly up at my master, and rave at the ill-luck that <lb/>
denied me a heavy conscience the one only time that I <lb/>
had ever wanted such a thing in my life. By and by I <lb/>
got to musing over the hour's strange adventure, and <lb/>
of course my human curiosity began to work. I set <lb/>
myself to framing in my mind some questions for this <lb/>
fiend to answer. Just then one of my boys entered, <lb/>
leaving the door open behind him, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"My! what <i>has</i> been going on here? The bookcase <lb/>
is all one riddle of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>I sprang up in consternation, and shouted:</p>
<p>"Out of this! Hurry! Jump! Fly! Shut the <lb/>
door! Quick, or my Conscience will get away!"</p>
<p>The door slammed to, and I locked it. I glanced <lb/>
up and was grateful, to the bottom of my heart, to see <lb/>
that my owner was still my prisoner. I said:</p>
<p>"Hang you, I might have lost you! Children are <lb/>
the heedlessest creatures. But look here, friend, the <lb/>
boy did not seem to notice you at all; how is that?"</p>
<p>"For a very good reason. I am invisible to all but <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>I made a mental note of that piece of information <lb/>
with a good deal of satisfaction. I could kill this mis- <lb/>
creant now, if I got a chance, and no one would know <lb/>
<pb n="314"/>
it. But this very reflection made me so light-hearted <lb/>
that my Conscience could hardly keep his seat, but was <lb/>
like to float aloft toward the ceiling like a toy balloon. <lb/>
I said, presently:</p>
<p>"Come, my Conscience, let us be friendly. Let us <lb/>
fly a flag of truce for a while. I am suffering to ask <lb/>
you some questions."</p>
<p>"Very well. Begin."</p>
<p>"Well, then, in the first place, why were you never <lb/>
visible to me before?"</p>
<p>"Because you never asked to see me before; that <lb/>
is, you never asked in the right spirit and the proper <lb/>
form before. You were just in the right spirit this <lb/>
time, and when you called for your most pitiless enemy <lb/>
I was that person by a very large majority, though you <lb/>
did not suspect it."</p>
<p>"Well, did that remark of mine turn you into flesh <lb/>
and blood?"</p>
<p>"No. It only made me visible to you. I am un- <lb/>
substantial, just as other spirits are."</p>
<p>This remark prodded me with a sharp misgiving. If <lb/>
he was unsubstantial, how was I going to kill him? <lb/>
But I dissembled, and said persuasively:</p>
<p>"Conscience, it isn't sociable of you to keep at such <lb/>
a distance. Come down and take another smoke."</p>
<p>This was answered with a look that was full of <lb/>
derision, and with this observation added:</p>
<p>"Come where you can get at me and kill me? The <lb/>
invitation is declined with thanks."</p>
<p>"All right," said I to myself; "so it seems a spirit <lb/>
<i>can</i> be killed, after all; there will be one spirit lacking <lb/>
in this world, presently, or I lose my guess." Then I <lb/>
said aloud:</p>
<p>"Friend&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"There; wait a bit. I am not your friend, I am <lb/>
your enemy; I am not your equal, I am your master. <lb/>
<pb n="315"/>
Call me 'my lord,' if you please. You are too <lb/>
familiar."</p>
<p>"I don't like such titles. I am willing to call you <lb/>
<i>sir</i>. That is as far as&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"We will have no argument about this. Just obey; <lb/>
that is all. Go on with your chatter."</p>
<p>"Very well, my lord&#x2014;since nothing but my lord <lb/>
will suit you&#x2014;I was going to ask you how long <lb/>
you will be visible to me?"</p>
<p>"Always!"</p>
<p>I broke out with strong indignation: "This is simply <lb/>
an outrage. That is what I think of it. You have <lb/>
dogged, and dogged, and <i>dogged</i> me, all the days of <lb/>
my life, invisible. That was misery enough; now to <lb/>
have such a looking thing as you tagging after me like <lb/>
another shadow all the rest of my days is an intolerable <lb/>
prospect. You have my opinion, my lord; make the <lb/>
most of it."</p>
<p>"My lad, there was never so pleased a conscience <lb/>
in this world as I was when you made me visible. It <lb/>
gives me an inconceivable advantage. <i>Now</i> I can look <lb/>
you straight in the eye, and call you names, and leer <lb/>
at you, jeer at you, sneer at you; and <i>you</i> know what <lb/>
eloquence there is in visible gesture and expression, <lb/>
more especially when the effect is heightened by audible <lb/>
speech. I shall always address you henceforth in your <lb/>
o-w-n s-n-i-v-e-l-i-n-g d-r-a-w-l&#x2014;baby!"</p>
<p>I let fly with the coal-hod. No result. My lord <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Come, come! Remember the flag of truce!"</p>
<p>"Ah, I forgot that. I will try to be civil; and <i>you</i> <lb/>
try it, too, for a novelty. The idea of a <i>civil</i> con- <lb/>
science! It is a good joke; an excellent joke. All <lb/>
the consciences <i>I</i> have ever heard of were nagging, <lb/>
badgering, fault-finding, execrable savages! Yes; and <lb/>
always in a sweat about some poor little insignificant <lb/>
<pb n="316"/>
trifle or other&#x2014;destruction catch the lot of them, <i>I</i> <lb/>
say! I would trade mine for the small-pox and seven <lb/>
kinds of consumption, and be glad of the chance. <lb/>
Now tell me, why <i>is</i> it that a conscience can't haul a <lb/>
man over the coals once, for an offense, and then let <lb/>
him alone? Why is it that it wants to keep on pegging <lb/>
at him, day and night and night and day, week in and <lb/>
week out, forever and ever, about the same old thing? <lb/>
There is no sense in that, and no reason in it. I think <lb/>
a conscience that will act like that is meaner than the <lb/>
very dirt itself."</p>
<p>"Well, <i>we</i> like it; that suffices."</p>
<p>"Do you do it with the honest intent to improve a <lb/>
man?"</p>
<p>That question produced a sarcastic smile, and this <lb/>
reply:</p>
<p>"No, sir. Excuse me. We do it simply because <lb/>
it is 'business.' It is our trade. The <i>purpose</i> of it <i>is</i> <lb/>
to improve the man, but <i>we</i> are merely disinterested <lb/>
agents. We are appointed by authority, and haven't <lb/>
anything to say in the matter. We obey orders and <lb/>
leave the consequences where they belong. But I am <lb/>
willing to admit this much: we <i>do</i> crowd the orders a <lb/>
trifle when we get a chance, which is most of the time. <lb/>
We enjoy it. We are instructed to remind a man a <lb/>
few times of an error; and I don't mind acknowledging <lb/>
that we try to give pretty good measure. And when <lb/>
we get hold of a man of a peculiarly sensitive nature, <lb/>
oh, but we do haze him! I have consciences to come <lb/>
all the way from China and Russia to see a person of <lb/>
that kind put through his paces, on a special occasion. <lb/>
Why, I knew a man of that sort who had accidentally <lb/>
crippled a mulatto baby; the news went abroad, and I <lb/>
wish you may never commit another sin if the con- <lb/>
sciences didn't flock from all over the earth to enjoy <lb/>
the fun and help his master exercise him. That man <lb/>
<pb n="317"/>
walked the floor in torture for forty-eight hours, with- <lb/>
out eating or sleeping, and then blew his brains out. <lb/>
The child was perfectly well again in three weeks."</p>
<p>"Well, you are a precious crew, not to put it too <lb/>
strong. I think I begin to see now why you have <lb/>
always been a trifle inconsistent with me. In your <lb/>
anxiety to get all the juice you can out of a sin, you <lb/>
make a man repent of it in three or four different ways. <lb/>
For instance, you found fault with me for lying to that <lb/>
tramp, and I suffered over that. But it was only <lb/>
yesterday that I told a tramp the square truth, to wit, <lb/>
that, it being regarded as bad citizenship to encourage <lb/>
vagrancy, I would give him nothing. What did you <lb/>
do <i>then?</i> Why, you made me say to myself, 'Ah, it <lb/>
would have been so much kinder and more blameless <lb/>
to ease him off with a little white lie, and send him <lb/>
away feeling that if he could not have bread, the gentle <lb/>
treatment was at least something to be grateful for!' <lb/>
Well, I suffered all day about <i>that</i>. Three days before <lb/>
I had fed a tramp, and fed him freely, supposing it a <lb/>
virtuous act. Straight off you said, 'Oh, false citizen, <lb/>
to have fed a tramp!' and I suffered as usual. I gave <lb/>
a tramp work; you objected to it&#x2014;<i>after</i> the contract <lb/>
was made, of course; you never speak up beforehand. <lb/>
Next, I <i>refused</i> a tramp work; you objected to <i>that</i>. <lb/>
Next, I proposed to kill a tramp; you kept me awake <lb/>
all night, oozing remorse at every pore. Sure I was <lb/>
going to be right <i>this</i> time, I sent the next tramp away <lb/>
with my benediction; and I wish you may live as long <lb/>
as I do, if you didn't make me smart all night again <lb/>
because I didn't kill him. Is there <i>any</i> way of satisfy- <lb/>
ing that malignant invention which is called a con- <lb/>
science?"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha! this is luxury! Go on!"</p>
<p>"But come, now, answer me that question. <i>Is</i> there <lb/>
any way?"</p>
<pb n="318"/>
<p>"Well, none that I propose to tell <i>you</i>, my son. <lb/>
Ass! I don't care <i>what</i> act you may turn your hand <lb/>
to, I can straightway whisper a word in your ear and <lb/>
make you think you have committed a dreadful mean- <lb/>
ness. It is my <i>business</i>&#x2014;and my joy&#x2014;to make you <lb/>
repent of <i>every</i>thing you do. If I have fooled away <lb/>
any opportunities it was not intentional; I beg to <lb/>
assure you it was not intentional!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry; you haven't missed a trick that <i>I</i> <lb/>
know of. I never did a thing in all my life, virtuous <lb/>
or otherwise, that I didn't repent of in twenty-four <lb/>
hours. In church last Sunday I listened to a charity <lb/>
sermon. My first impulse was to give three hundred <lb/>
and fifty dollars; I repented of that and reduced it a <lb/>
hundred; repented of that and reduced it another hun- <lb/>
dred; repented of that and reduced it another hundred; <lb/>
repented of that and reduced the remaining fifty to <lb/>
twenty-five; repented of that and came down to fifteen; <lb/>
repented of that and dropped to two dollars and a half; <lb/>
when the plate came around at last, I repented once <lb/>
more and contributed ten cents. Well, when I got <lb/>
home, I did wish to goodness I had that ten cents back <lb/>
again! You never <i>did</i> let me get through a charity <lb/>
sermon without having something to sweat about."</p>
<p>"Oh, and I never shall, I never shall. You can <lb/>
always depend on me."</p>
<p>"I think so. Many and many's the restless night <lb/>
I've wanted to take you by the neck. If I could only <lb/>
get hold of you now!"</p>
<p>"Yes, no doubt. But I am not an ass; I am only <lb/>
the saddle of an ass. But go on, go on. You enter- <lb/>
tain me more than I like to confess."</p>
<p>"I am glad of that. (You will not mind my lying <lb/>
a little, to keep in practice.) Look here; not to be <lb/>
too personal, I think you are about the shabbiest and <lb/>
most contemptible little shriveled-up reptile that can be <lb/>
<pb n="319"/>
imagined. I am grateful enough that you are invisible <lb/>
to other people, for I should die with shame to be seen <lb/>
with such a mildewed monkey of a conscience as <i>you</i> <lb/>
are. Now if you were five or six feet high, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, come! who is to blame?"</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> don't know."</p>
<p>"Why, you are; nobody else."</p>
<p>"Confound you, I wasn't consulted about your per- <lb/>
sonal appearance."</p>
<p>"I don't care, you had a good deal to do with it, <lb/>
nevertheless. When you were eight or nine years old, <lb/>
I was seven feet high, and as pretty as a picture."</p>
<p>"I wish you had died young! So you have grown <lb/>
the wrong way, have you?"</p>
<p>"Some of us grow one way and some the other. <lb/>
You had a large conscience once; if you've a small <lb/>
conscience now I reckon there are reasons for it. <lb/>
However, both of us are to blame, you and I. You <lb/>
see, you used to be conscientious about a great many <lb/>
things; morbidly so, I may say. It was a great many <lb/>
years ago. You probably do not remember it now. <lb/>
Well, I took a great interest in my work, and I so <lb/>
enjoyed the anguish which certain pet sins of yours <lb/>
afflicted you with, that I kept pelting at you until I <lb/>
rather overdid the matter. You began to rebel. Of <lb/>
course I began to lose ground, then, and shrivel a little <lb/>
&#x2014;diminish in stature, get mouldy, and grow deformed. <lb/>
The more I weakened, the more stubbornly you fastened <lb/>
on to those particular sins; till at last the places on my <lb/>
person that represent those vices became as callous as <lb/>
shark skin. Take smoking, for instance. I played <lb/>
that card a little too long, and I lost. When people <lb/>
plead with you at this late day to quit that vice, that <lb/>
old callous place seems to enlarge and cover me all <lb/>
over like a shirt of mail. It exerts a mysterious, <lb/>
smothering effect; and presently I, your faithful hater, <lb/>
<pb n="320"/>
your devoted Conscience, go sound asleep! Sound? <lb/>
It is no name for it. I couldn't hear it thunder at <lb/>
such a time. You have some few other vices&#x2014;per- <lb/>
haps eighty, or maybe ninety&#x2014;that affect me in much <lb/>
the same way."</p>
<p>"This is flattering; you must be asleep a good part <lb/>
of your time."</p>
<p>"Yes, of late years. I should be asleep <i>all</i> the <lb/>
time, but for the help I get."</p>
<p>"Who helps you?"</p>
<p>"Other consciences. Whenever a person whose <lb/>
conscience I am acquainted with tries to plead with <lb/>
you about the vices you are callous to, I get my friend <lb/>
to give his client a pang concerning some villainy of his <lb/>
own, and that shuts off his meddling and starts him off <lb/>
to hunt personal consolation. My field of usefulness <lb/>
is about trimmed down to tramps, budding authoresses, <lb/>
and that line of goods now; but don't you worry&#x2014; <lb/>
I'll harry you on <i>them</i> while they last! Just you put <lb/>
your trust in me."</p>
<p>"I think I can. But if you had only been good <lb/>
enough to mention these facts some thirty years ago, I <lb/>
should have turned my particular attention to sin, and <lb/>
I think that by this time I should not only have had <lb/>
you pretty permanently asleep on the entire list of <lb/>
human vices, but reduced to the size of a hom&#x0153;opathic <lb/>
pill, at that. That is about the style of conscience <i>I</i> <lb/>
am pining for. If I only had you shrunk down to a <lb/>
hom&#x0153;opathic pill, and could get my hands on you, <lb/>
would I put you in a glass case for a keepsake? No, <lb/>
sir. I would give you to a yellow dog! That is where <lb/>
<i>you</i> ought to be&#x2014;you and all your tribe. You are <lb/>
not fit to be in society, in my opinion. Now another <lb/>
question. Do you know a good many consciences in <lb/>
this section?"</p>
<p>"Plenty of them."</p>
<pb n="321"/>
<p>"I would give anything to see some of them! <lb/>
Could you bring them here? And would they be <lb/>
visible to me?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"I suppose I ought to have known that without ask- <lb/>
ing. But no matter, you can describe them. Tell me <lb/>
about my neighbor Thompson's conscience, please."</p>
<p>"Very well. I know him intimately; have known <lb/>
him many years. I knew him when he was eleven feet <lb/>
high and of a faultless figure. But he is very rusty <lb/>
and tough and misshapen now, and hardly ever interests <lb/>
himself about anything. As to his present size&#x2014;well, <lb/>
he sleeps in a cigar box."</p>
<p>"Likely enough. There are few smaller, meaner <lb/>
men in this region than Hugh Thompson. Do you <lb/>
know Robinson's conscience?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He is a shade under four and a half feet <lb/>
high; used to be a blonde; is a brunette now, but still <lb/>
shapely and comely."</p>
<p>"Well, Robinson is a good fellow. Do you know <lb/>
Tom Smith's conscience?"</p>
<p>"I have known him from childhood. He was <lb/>
thirteen inches high, and rather sluggish, when he was <lb/>
two years old&#x2014;as nearly all of us are at that age. He <lb/>
is thirty-seven feet high now, and the stateliest figure <lb/>
in America. His legs are still racked with growing- <lb/>
pains, but he has a good time, nevertheless. Never <lb/>
sleeps. He is the most active and energetic member <lb/>
of the New England Conscience Club; is president of <lb/>
it. Night and day you can find him pegging away at <lb/>
Smith, panting with his labor, sleeves rolled up, <lb/>
countenance all alive with enjoyment. He has got his <lb/>
victim splendidly dragooned now. He can make poor <lb/>
Smith imagine that the most innocent little thing he <lb/>
does is an odious sin; and then he sets to work and <lb/>
almost tortures the soul out of him about it."</p>
<pb n="322"/>
<p>"Smith is the noblest man in all this section, and <lb/>
the purest; and yet is always breaking his heart be- <lb/>
cause he cannot be good! Only a conscience <i>could</i> <lb/>
find pleasure in heaping agony upon a spirit like that. <lb/>
Do you know my aunt Mary's conscience?"</p>
<p>"I have seen her at a distance, but am not ac- <lb/>
quainted with her. She lives in the open air altogether, <lb/>
because no door is large enough to admit her."</p>
<p>"I can believe that. Let me see. Do you know <lb/>
the conscience of that publisher who once stole some <lb/>
sketches of mine for a 'series' of his, and then left me <lb/>
to pay the law expenses I had to incur in order to <lb/>
choke him off?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He has a wide fame. He was exhibited, a <lb/>
month ago, with some other antiquities, for the benefit <lb/>
of a recent Member of the Cabinet's conscience that <lb/>
was starving in exile. Tickets and fares were high, <lb/>
but I traveled for nothing by pretending to be the con- <lb/>
science of an editor, and got in for half-price by repre- <lb/>
senting myself to be the conscience of a clergyman. <lb/>
However, the publisher's conscience, which was to <lb/>
have been the main feature of the entertainment, was a <lb/>
failure&#x2014;as an exhibition. He was there, but what of <lb/>
that? The management had provided a microscope <lb/>
with a magnifying power of only thirty thousand <lb/>
diameters, and so nobody got to see him, after all. <lb/>
There was great and general dissatisfaction, of course, <lb/>
but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Just here there was an eager footstep on the stair; I <lb/>
opened the door, and my aunt Mary burst into the <lb/>
room. It was a joyful meeting and a cheery bombard- <lb/>
ment of questions and answers concerning family mat- <lb/>
ters ensued. By and by my aunt said:</p>
<p>"But I am going to abuse you a little now. You <lb/>
promised me, the day I saw you last, that you would <lb/>
look after the needs of the poor family around the <lb/>
<pb n="323"/>
corner as faithfully as I had done it myself. Well, I <lb/>
found out by accident that you failed of your promise. <lb/>
<i>Was</i> that right?"</p>
<p>In simple truth, I never had thought of that family a <lb/>
second time! And now such a splintering pang of <lb/>
guilt shot through me! I glanced up at my Conscience. <lb/>
Plainly, my heavy heart was affecting him. His body <lb/>
was drooping forward; he seemed about to fall from <lb/>
the bookcase. My aunt continued:</p>
<p>"And think how you have neglected my poor <i>prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E8;</i> <lb/>
at the almshouse, you dear, hard-hearted promise- <lb/>
breaker!" I blushed scarlet, and my tongue was tied. <lb/>
As the sense of my guilty negligence waxed sharper <lb/>
and stronger, my Conscience began to sway heavily <lb/>
back and forth; and when my aunt, after a little pause, <lb/>
said in a grieved tone, "Since you never once went to <lb/>
see her, maybe it will not distress you now to know <lb/>
that that poor child died, months ago, utterly friendless <lb/>
and forsaken!" my Conscience could no longer bear <lb/>
up under the weight of my sufferings, but tumbled <lb/>
headlong from his high perch and struck the floor with <lb/>
a dull, leaden thump. He lay there writhing with pain <lb/>
and quaking with apprehension, but straining every <lb/>
muscle in frantic efforts to get up. In a fever of ex- <lb/>
pectancy I sprang to the door, locked it, placed my <lb/>
back against it, and bent a watchful gaze upon my <lb/>
struggling master. Already my fingers were itching to <lb/>
begin their murderous work.</p>
<p>"Oh, what <i>can</i> be the matter!" exclaimed by aunt, <lb/>
shrinking from me, and following with her frightened <lb/>
eyes the direction of mine. My breath was coming in <lb/>
short, quick gasps now, and my excitement was almost <lb/>
uncontrollable. My aunt cried out:</p>
<p>"Oh, do not look so! You appall me! Oh, what <lb/>
can the matter be? What is it you see? Why do you <lb/>
stare so? Why do you work your fingers like that?"</p>
<pb n="324"/>
<p>"Peace, woman!" I said, in a hoarse whisper. <lb/>
"Look elsewhere; pay no attention to me; it is <lb/>
nothing&#x2014;nothing. I am often this way. It will <lb/>
pass in a moment. It comes from smoking too <lb/>
much."</p>
<p>My injured lord was up, wild-eyed with terror, and <lb/>
trying to hobble toward the door. I could hardly <lb/>
breathe, I was so wrought up. My aunt wrung her <lb/>
hands, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, I knew how it would be; I knew it would come <lb/>
to this at last! Oh, I implore you to crush out that fatal <lb/>
habit while it may yet be time! You must not, you <lb/>
shall not be deaf to my supplications longer!" My <lb/>
struggling Conscience showed sudden signs of weari- <lb/>
ness! "Oh, promise me you will throw off this hate- <lb/>
ful slavery of tobacco!" My Conscience began to <lb/>
reel drowsily, and grope with his hands&#x2014;enchanting <lb/>
spectacle! "I beg you, I beseech you, I implore you! <lb/>
Your reason is deserting you! There is madness in <lb/>
your eye! It flames with frenzy! Oh, hear me, hear <lb/>
me, and be saved! See, I plead with you on my very <lb/>
knees!" As she sank before me my Conscience reeled <lb/>
again, and then drooped languidly to the floor, blink- <lb/>
ing toward me a last supplication for mercy, with heavy <lb/>
eyes. "Oh, promise, or you are lost! Promise, and <lb/>
be redeemed! Promise! Promise and live!" With <lb/>
a long-drawn sigh my conquered Conscience closed his <lb/>
eyes and fell fast asleep!</p>
<p>With an exultant shout I sprang past my aunt, and <lb/>
in an instant I had my lifelong foe by the throat. <lb/>
After so many years of waiting and longing, he was mine <lb/>
at last. I tore him to shreds and fragments. I rent <lb/>
the fragments to bits. I cast the bleeding rubbish into <lb/>
the fire, and drew into my nostrils the grateful incense <lb/>
of my burnt-offering. At last, and forever, my Con- <lb/>
science was dead!</p>
<pb n="325"/>
<p>I was a free man! I turned upon my poor aunt, <lb/>
who was almost petrified with terror, and shouted:</p>
<p>"Out of this with your paupers, your charities, your <lb/>
reforms, your pestilent morals! You behold before <lb/>
you a man whose life-conflict is done, whose soul is at <lb/>
peace; a man whose heart is dead to sorrow, dead to <lb/>
suffering, dead to remorse; a man <smcap>without a con- <lb/>
science</smcap>! In my joy I spare you, though I could <lb/>
throttle you and never feel a pang! Fly!"</p>
<p>She fled. Since that day my life is all bliss. Bliss, <lb/>
unalloyed bliss. Nothing in all the world could per- <lb/>
suade me to have a conscience again. I settled all my <lb/>
old outstanding scores, and began the world anew. I <lb/>
killed thirty-eight persons during the first two weeks&#x2014; <lb/>
all of them on account of ancient grudges. I burned a <lb/>
dwelling that interrupted my view. I swindled a widow <lb/>
and some orphans out of their last cow, which is a very <lb/>
good one, though not thoroughbred, I believe. I have <lb/>
also committed scores of crimes, of various kinds, and <lb/>
have enjoyed my work exceedingly, whereas it would <lb/>
formerly have broken my heart and turned my hair <lb/>
gray, I have no doubt.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I wish to state, by way of advertise- <lb/>
ment, that medical colleges desiring assorted tramps <lb/>
for scientific purposes, either by the gross, by cord <lb/>
measurement, or per ton, will do well to examine the <lb/>
lot in my cellar before purchasing elsewhere, as these <lb/>
were all selected and prepared by myself, and can be <lb/>
had at a low rate, because I wish to clear out my stock <lb/>
and get ready for the spring trade.</p>

<head><b>ABOUT MAGNANIMOUS-INCIDENT <lb/>
LITERATURE</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>All</smcap> my life, from boyhood up, I have had the habit <lb/>
of reading a certain set of anecdotes, written in <lb/>
the quaint vein of The World's ingenious Fabulist, for <lb/>
the lesson they taught me and the pleasure they gave <lb/>
me. They lay always convenient to my hand, and <lb/>
whenever I thought meanly of my kind I turned to <lb/>
them, and they banished that sentiment; whenever I <lb/>
felt myself to be selfish, sordid, and ignoble I turned <lb/>
to them, and they told me what to do to win back my <lb/>
self-respect. Many times I wished that the charming <lb/>
anecdotes had not stopped with their happy climaxes, <lb/>
but had continued the pleasing history of the several <lb/>
benefactors and beneficiaries. This wish rose in my <lb/>
breast so persistently that at last I determined to satisfy <lb/>
it by seeking out the sequels of those anecdotes myself. <lb/>
So I set about it, and after great labor and tedious re- <lb/>
search accomplished my task. I will lay the result be- <lb/>
fore you, giving you each anecdote in its turn, and fol- <lb/>
lowing it with its sequel as I gathered it through my <lb/>
investigations.</p>

<head><smcap>the grateful poodle</smcap></head>
<p>One day a benevolent physician (who had read the <lb/>
books) having found a stray poodle suffering from a <lb/>
broken leg, conveyed the poor creature to his home, <lb/>
<pb n="327"/>
and after setting and bandaging the injured limb gave <lb/>
the little outcast its liberty again, and thought no more <lb/>
about the matter. But how great was his surprise, <lb/>
upon opening his door one morning, some days later, <lb/>
to find the grateful poodle patiently waiting there, and <lb/>
in its company another stray dog, one of whose legs, <lb/>
by some accident, had been broken. The kind physi- <lb/>
cian at once relieved the distressed animal, nor did he <lb/>
forget to admire the inscrutable goodness and mercy of <lb/>
God, who had been willing to use so humble an instru- <lb/>
ment as the poor outcast poodle for the inculcating of, <lb/>
etc., etc., etc.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<head><smcap>sequel</smcap></head>
<p>The next morning the benevolent physician found <lb/>
the two dogs, beaming with gratitude, waiting at his <lb/>
door, and with them two other dogs&#x2014;cripples. The <lb/>
cripples were speedily healed, and the four went their <lb/>
way, leaving the benevolent physician more overcome <lb/>
by pious wonder than ever. The day passed, the <lb/>
morning came. There at the door sat now the four <lb/>
reconstructed dogs, and with them four others requir- <lb/>
ing reconstruction. This day also passed, and another <lb/>
morning came; and now sixteen dogs, eight of them <lb/>
newly crippled, occupied the sidewalk, and the people <lb/>
were going around. By noon the broken legs were all <lb/>
set, but the pious wonder in the good physician's <lb/>
breast was beginning to get mixed with involuntary <lb/>
profanity. The sun rose once more, and exhibited <lb/>
thirty-two dogs, sixteen of them with broken legs, oc- <lb/>
cupying the sidewalk and half of the street; the human <lb/>
spectators took up the rest of the room. The cries of <lb/>
the wounded, the songs of the healed brutes, and the <lb/>
comments of the on-looking citizens made great and in- <lb/>
spiring cheer, but traffic was interrupted in that street. <lb/>
The good physician hired a couple of assistant surgeons <lb/>
<pb n="328"/>
and got through his benevolent work before dark, first <lb/>
taking the precaution to cancel his church membership, <lb/>
so that he might express himself with the latitude which <lb/>
the case required.</p>
<p>But some things have their limits. When once more <lb/>
the morning dawned, and the good physician looked <lb/>
out upon a massed and far-reaching multitude of <lb/>
clamorous and beseeching dogs, he said, "I might as <lb/>
well acknowledge it, I have been fooled by the books; <lb/>
they only tell the pretty part of the story, and then <lb/>
stop. Fetch me the shotgun; this thing has gone along <lb/>
far enough."</p>
<p>He issued forth with his weapon, and chanced to step <lb/>
upon the tail of the original poodle, who promptly bit <lb/>
him in the leg. Now the great and good work which <lb/>
this poodle had been engaged in had engendered in him <lb/>
such a mighty and augmenting enthusiasm as to turn <lb/>
his weak head at last and drive him mad. A month <lb/>
later, when the benevolent physician lay in the death <lb/>
throes of hydrophobia, he called his weeping friends <lb/>
about him, and said:</p>
<p>"Beware of the books. They tell but half of the <lb/>
story. Whenever a poor wretch asks you for help, <lb/>
and you feel a doubt as to what result may flow from <lb/>
your benevolence, give yourself the benefit of the <lb/>
doubt and kill the applicant."</p>
<p>And so saying he turned his face to the wall and gave <lb/>
up the ghost.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<head><smcap>the benevolent author</smcap></head>
<p>A poor and young literary beginner had tried in vain <lb/>
to get his manuscripts accepted. At last, when the <lb/>
horrors of starvation were staring him in the face, he <lb/>
laid his sad case before a celebrated author, beseeching <lb/>
his counsel and assistance. This generous man im- <lb/>
mediately put aside his own matters and proceeded to <lb/>
<pb n="329"/>
peruse one of the despised manuscripts. Having com- <lb/>
pleted his kindly task, he shook the poor young man <lb/>
cordially by the hand, saying, "I perceive merit in <lb/>
this; come again to me on Monday." At the time <lb/>
specified, the celebrated author, with a sweet smile, but <lb/>
saying nothing, spread open a magazine which was <lb/>
damp from the press. What was the poor young man's <lb/>
astonishment to discover upon the printed page his <lb/>
own article. "How can I ever," said he, falling upon <lb/>
his knees and bursting into tears, "testify my gratitude <lb/>
for this noble conduct!"</p>
<p>The celebrated author was the renowned Snodgrass; <lb/>
the poor young beginner thus rescued from obscurity <lb/>
and starvation was the afterwards equally renowned <lb/>
Snagsby. Let this pleasing incident admonish us to <lb/>
turn a charitable ear to all beginners that need help.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<head><smcap>sequel</smcap></head>
<p>The next week Snagsby was back with five rejected <lb/>
manuscripts. The celebrated author was a little sur- <lb/>
prised, because in the books the young struggler had <lb/>
needed but one lift, apparently. However, he <lb/>
plowed through these papers, removing unnecessary <lb/>
flowers and digging up some acres of adjective stumps, <lb/>
and then succeeded in getting two of the articles <lb/>
accepted.</p>
<p>A week or so drifted by, and the grateful Snagsby <lb/>
arrived with another cargo. The celebrated author <lb/>
had felt a mighty glow of satisfaction within himself the <lb/>
first time he had successfully befriended the poor young <lb/>
struggler, and had compared himself with the generous <lb/>
people in the books with high gratification; but he was <lb/>
beginning to suspect now that he had struck upon some- <lb/>
thing fresh in the noble-episode line. His enthusiasm <lb/>
took a chill. Still, he could not bear to repulse this <lb/>
<pb n="330"/>
struggling young author, who clung to him with such <lb/>
pretty simplicity and trustfulness.</p>
<p>Well, the upshot of it all was that the celebrated <lb/>
author presently found himself permanently freighted <lb/>
with the poor young beginner. All his mild efforts to <lb/>
unload this cargo went for nothing. He had to give <lb/>
daily counsel, daily encouragement; he had to keep on <lb/>
procuring magazine acceptances, and then revamping <lb/>
the manuscripts to make them presentable. When the <lb/>
young aspirant got a start at last, he rode into sudden <lb/>
fame by describing the celebrated author's private life <lb/>
with such a caustic humor and such minuteness of blis- <lb/>
tering detail that the book sold a prodigious edition, and <lb/>
broke the celebrated author's heart with mortification. <lb/>
With his latest gasp he said, "Alas, the books deceived <lb/>
me; they do not tell the whole story. Beware of the <lb/>
struggling young author, my friends. Whom God sees <lb/>
fit to starve, let not man presumptuously rescue to his <lb/>
own undoing."</p>

<p>One day a lady was driving through the principal <lb/>

took fright and dashed madly away, hurling the coach- <lb/>
man from his box and leaving the occupants of the car- <lb/>
riage paralyzed with terror. But a brave youth who <lb/>
was driving a grocery wagon threw himself before the <lb/>

flight at the peril of his own.<ref target="n5">*</ref><note id="n5" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>This is probably a misprint.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> The grateful lady took <lb/>

the heroic act to her husband (who had read the books), <lb/>
who listened with streaming eyes to the moving recital, <lb/>
and who, after returning thanks, in conjunction with his <lb/>

<pb n="331"/>
brave young person, and, placing a check for five <lb/>
hundred dollars in his hand, said, "Take this as a re- <lb/>

you shall need a friend, remember that Thompson Mc- <lb/>
Spadden has a grateful heart." Let us learn from this <lb/>
that a good deed cannot fail to benefit the doer, how- <lb/>
ever humble he may be.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter">
<head><smcap>sequel</smcap></head>
<p>William Ferguson called the next week and asked <lb/>
Mr. McSpadden to use his influence to get him a <lb/>
higher employment, he feeling capable of better things <lb/>
than driving a grocer's wagon. Mr. McSpadden got <lb/>
him an underclerkship at a good salary.</p>
<p>Presently William Ferguson's mother fell sick, and <lb/>
William&#x2014; Well, to cut the story short, Mr. Mc- <lb/>
Spadden consented to take her into his house. Before <lb/>
long she yearned for the society of her younger <lb/>
children; so Mary and Julia were admitted also, and <lb/>
little Jimmy, their brother. Jimmy had a pocket-knife, <lb/>
and he wandered into the drawing-room with it one <lb/>
day, alone, and reduced ten thousand dollars' worth of <lb/>
furniture to an indeterminable value in rather less than <lb/>
three-quarters of an hour. A day or two later he fell <lb/>
downstairs and broke his neck, and seventeen of his <lb/>
family's relatives came to the house to attend the <lb/>
funeral. This made them acquainted, and they kept <lb/>
the kitchen occupied after that, and likewise kept the <lb/>
McSpaddens busy hunting up situations of various sorts <lb/>
for them, and hunting up more when they wore these <lb/>
out. The old woman drank a good deal and swore a good <lb/>
deal; but the grateful McSpaddens knew it was their <lb/>
duty to reform her, considering what her son had done <lb/>
for them, so they clave nobly to their generous task. <lb/>
William came often and got decreasing sums of money, <lb/>
and asked for higher and more lucrative employments <lb/>
<pb n="332"/>
&#x2014;which the grateful McSpadden more or less promptly <lb/>
procured for him. McSpadden consented also, after <lb/>
some demur, to fit William for college; but when the <lb/>
first vacation came and the hero requested to be sent to <lb/>
Europe for his health, the persecuted McSpadden rose <lb/>
against the tyrant and revolted. He plainly and <lb/>
squarely refused. William Ferguson's mother was so <lb/>
astounded that she let her gin-bottle drop, and her pro- <lb/>
fane lips refused to do their office. When she re- <lb/>
covered she said in a half-gasp, "Is this your gratitude? <lb/>
Where would your wife and boy be now, but for my <lb/>
son?"</p>
<p>William said, "Is this your gratitude? Did I save <lb/>
your wife's life or not? Tell me that!"</p>
<p>Seven relations swarmed in from the kitchen and each <lb/>
said, "And this is his gratitude!"</p>
<p>William's sisters stared, bewildered, and said, "And <lb/>
this is his grat&#x2014;" but were interrupted by their <lb/>
mother, who burst into tears and exclaimed, "To <lb/>
think that my sainted little Jimmy threw away his life <lb/>
in the service of such a reptile!"</p>
<p>Then the pluck of the revolutionary McSpadden rose <lb/>
to the occasion, and he replied with fervor, "Out of <lb/>
my house, the whole beggarly tribe of you! I was <lb/>
beguiled by the books, but shall never be beguiled <lb/>
again&#x2014;once is sufficient for me." And turning to <lb/>
William he shouted, "Yes, you did save my wife's life, <lb/>
and the next man that does it shall die in his tracks!"</p>
<p>Not being a clergyman, I place my text at the end <lb/>
of my sermon instead of at the beginning. Here it is, <lb/>
from Mr. Noah Brooks's Recollections of President <lb/>
Lincoln in <i>Scribner's Monthly:</i> <lb/>
<q>J. H. Hackett, in his part of Falstaff, was an actor who gave Mr. <lb/>
Lincoln great delight. With his usual desire to signify to others his sense <lb/>
<pb n="333"/>
of obligation, Mr. Lincoln wrote a genial little note to the actor expressing <lb/>
his pleasure at witnessing his performance. Mr. Hackett, in reply, sent a <lb/>
book of some sort; perhaps it was one of his own authorship. He also <lb/>
wrote several notes to the President. One night, quite late, when the epi- <lb/>
sode had passed out of my mind, I went to the White House in answer to a <lb/>
message. Passing into the President's office, I noticed, to my surprise, <lb/>
Hackett sitting in the anteroom as if waiting for an audience. The Presi- <lb/>
dent asked me if any one was outside. On being told, he said, half <lb/>
sadly, "Oh, I can't see him, I can't see him; I was in hopes he had gone <lb/>
away." Then he added, "Now this just illustrates the difficulty of having <lb/>
pleasant friends and acquaintances in this place. You know how I liked <lb/>
Hackett as an actor, and how I wrote to tell him so. He sent me that <lb/>
book, and there I thought the matter would end. He is a master of his <lb/>
place in the profession, I suppose, and well fixed in it; but just because we <lb/>
had a little friendly correspondence, such as any two men might have, he <lb/>
wants something. What do you suppose he wants?" I could not guess, <lb/>
and Mr. Lincoln added, "Well, he wants to be consul to London. Oh, <lb/>
dear!"</q></p>
<p>I will observe, in conclusion, that the William Fer- <lb/>
guson incident occurred, and within my personal knowl- <lb/>
edge&#x2014;though I have changed the nature of the de- <lb/>
tails, to keep William from recognizing himself in it.</p>
<p>All the readers of this article have in some sweet and <lb/>
gushing hour of their lives played the role of Magnan- <lb/>
imous-Incident hero. I wish I knew how many there <lb/>
are among them who are willing to talk about that <lb/>
episode and like to be reminded of the consequences <lb/>
that flowed from it.</p>

</lg></q>
<p>I came across these jingling rhymes in a newspaper, <lb/>
a little while ago, and read them a couple of times. <lb/>
They took instant and entire possession of me. All <lb/>
through breakfast they went waltzing through my brain; <lb/>
and when, at last, I rolled up my napkin, I could not <lb/>
tell whether I had eaten anything or not. I had care- <lb/>
fully laid out my day's work the day before&#x2014;a thrill- <lb/>
ing tragedy in the novel which I am writing. I went <lb/>
to my den to begin my deed of blood. I took up my <lb/>
pen, but all I could get it to say was, "Punch in the <lb/>
presence of the passenjare." I fought hard for an <lb/>
hour, but it was useless. My head kept humming, <lb/>
<pb n="335"/>
"A blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip <lb/>
for a six-cent fare," and so on and so on, without <lb/>
peace or respite. The day's work was ruined&#x2014;I <lb/>
could see that plainly enough. I gave up and drifted <lb/>
down-town, and presently discovered that my feet were <lb/>
keeping time to that relentless jingle. When I could <lb/>
stand it no longer I altered my step. But it did no <lb/>
good; those rhymes accommodated themselves to the <lb/>
new step and went on harassing me just as before. I <lb/>
returned home, and suffered all the afternoon; suffered <lb/>
all through an unconscious and unrefreshing dinner; <lb/>
suffered, and cried, and jingled all through the evening; <lb/>
went to bed and rolled, tossed, and jingled right along, <lb/>
the same as ever; got up at midnight frantic, and <lb/>
tried to read; but there was nothing visible upon the <lb/>
whirling page except "Punch! punch in the presence <lb/>
of the passenjare." By sunrise I was out of my mind, <lb/>
and everybody marveled and was distressed at the <lb/>
idiotic burden of my ravings&#x2014;"Punch! oh, punch! <lb/>
punch in the presence of the passenjare!"</p>
<p>Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tot- <lb/>
tering wreck, and went forth to fulfill an engagement <lb/>
with a valued friend, the Rev. Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, to walk to the <lb/>
Talcott Tower, ten miles distant. He stared at me, <lb/>
but asked no questions. We started. Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> talked, <lb/>
talked, talked&#x2014;as is his wont. I said nothing; <lb/>
I heard nothing. At the end of a mile, Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Mark, are you sick? I never saw a man look so <lb/>
haggard and worn and absent-minded. Say some- <lb/>
thing, do!"</p>
<p>Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: "Punch, <lb/>
brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of <lb/>
the passenjare!"</p>
<p>My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, then <lb/>
said:</p>
<pb n="336"/>
<p>"I do not think I get your drift, Mark. There does <lb/>
not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said, <lb/>
certainly nothing sad; and yet&#x2014;maybe it was the way <lb/>
you <i>said</i> the words&#x2014;I never heard anything that <lb/>
sounded so pathetic. What is&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But I heard no more. I was already far away with <lb/>
my pitiless, heart-breaking "blue trip slip for an eight- <lb/>
cent fare, buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, pink trip <lb/>
slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the presence of the <lb/>
passenjare." I do not know what occurred during the <lb/>
other nine miles. However, all of a sudden Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> <lb/>
laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted:</p>
<p>"Oh, wake up! wake up! wake up! Don't sleep <lb/>
all day! Here we are at the Tower, man! I have <lb/>
talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never got <lb/>
a response. Just look at this magnificent autumn land- <lb/>
scape! Look at it! look at it! Feast your eyes on it! <lb/>
You have traveled; you have seen boasted landscapes <lb/>
elsewhere. Come, now, deliver an honest opinion. <lb/>
What do you say to this?"</p>
<p>I sighed wearily, and murmured:</p>
<p>"A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip <lb/>
for a three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the <lb/>
passenjare."</p>
<p>Rev. Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> stood there, very grave, full of con- <lb/>
cern, apparently, and looked long at me; then he <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Mark, there is something about this that I cannot <lb/>
understand. Those are about the same words you said <lb/>
before; there does not seem to be anything in them, <lb/>
and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them. <lb/>
Punch in the&#x2014;how is it they go?"</p>
<p>I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines.</p>
<p>My friend's face lighted with interest. He said:</p>
<p>"Why, what a captivating jingle it is! It is almost <lb/>
music. It flows along so nicely. I have nearly caught <lb/>
<pb n="337"/>
the rhymes myself. Say them over just once more, <lb/>
and then I'll have them, sure."</p>
<p>I said them over. Then Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> said them. He <lb/>
made one little mistake, which I corrected. The next <lb/>
time and the next he got them right. Now a great <lb/>
burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders. That <lb/>
torturing jingle departed out of my brain, and a grate- <lb/>
ful sense of rest and peace descended upon me. I was <lb/>
light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing for half <lb/>
an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward. <lb/>
Then my freed tongue found blessed speech again, and <lb/>
the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and <lb/>
flow. It flowed on and on, joyously, jubilantly, until <lb/>
the fountain was empty and dry. As I wrung my <lb/>
friend's hand at parting, I said:</p>
<p>"Haven't we had a royal good time! But now I <lb/>
remember, you haven't said a word for two hours. <lb/>
Come, come, out with something!"</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> turned a lack-lustre eye upon <lb/>
me, drew a deep sigh, and said, without animation, <lb/>
without apparent consciousness:</p>
<p>"Punch, brothers, punch with care! Punch in the <lb/>
presence of the passenjare!"</p>
<p>A pang shot through me as I said to myself, "Poor <lb/>
fellow, poor fellow! <i>he</i> has got it, now."</p>
<p>I did not see Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> for two or three days after <lb/>
that. Then, on Tuesday evening, he staggered into <lb/>
my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat. He was <lb/>
pale, worn; he was a wreck. He lifted his faded eyes <lb/>
to my face and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made <lb/>
in those heartless rhymes. They have ridden me like <lb/>
a nightmare, day and night, hour after hour, to this <lb/>
very moment. Since I saw you I have suffered the <lb/>
torments of the lost. Saturday evening I had a sudden <lb/>
call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston. <lb/>
<pb n="338"/>
The occasion was the death of a valued old friend who <lb/>
had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon. <lb/>
I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing <lb/>
the discourse. But I never got beyond the opening <lb/>
paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels <lb/>
began their 'clack, clack&#x2014;clack-clack-clack! clack- <lb/>
clack&#x2014;clack-clack-clack!' and right away those odious <lb/>
rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment. For <lb/>
an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes <lb/>
to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels <lb/>
made. Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had <lb/>
been chopping wood all day. My skull was splitting <lb/>
with headache. It seemed to me that I must go mad <lb/>
if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to <lb/>
bed. I stretched myself out in my berth, and&#x2014;well, <lb/>
you know what the result was. The thing went right <lb/>
along, just the same. 'Clack-clack-clack, a blue trip <lb/>
slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight-cent fare; clack- <lb/>
clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for a six- <lb/>
cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on&#x2014;<i>punch</i> in <lb/>
the presence of the passenjare!' Sleep? Not a single <lb/>
wink! I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston. <lb/>
Don't ask me about the funeral. I did the best I could, <lb/>
but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and <lb/>
tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, <lb/>
punch with care, punch in the presence of the passen- <lb/>
jare.' And the most distressing thing was that my <lb/>
<i>delivery</i> dropped into the undulating rhythm of those <lb/>
pulsing rhymes, and I could actually catch absent- <lb/>
minded people nodding <i>time</i> to the swing of it <lb/>
with their stupid heads. And, Mark, you may be- <lb/>
lieve it or not, but before I got through, the entire <lb/>
assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn <lb/>
unison, mourners, undertaker, and all. The moment I <lb/>
had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering <lb/>
on frenzy. Of course it would be my luck to find a <lb/>
<pb n="339"/>
sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, <lb/>
who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into <lb/>
the church. She began to sob, and said:</p>
<p>"'Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn't see <lb/>
him before he died!'</p>
<p>"'Yes!' I said, 'he <i>is</i> gone, he <i>is</i> gone, he <i>is</i> gone <lb/>
&#x2014;oh, <i>will</i> this suffering never cease!'</p>
<p>"'<i>You</i> loved him, then! Oh, you too loved him!'</p>
<p>"'Loved him! Loved <i>who?</i>'</p>
<p>"'Why, my poor George! my poor nephew!'</p>
<p>"'Oh&#x2014;<i>him!</i> Yes&#x2014;oh, yes, yes. Certainly&#x2014; <lb/>
certainly. Punch&#x2014;punch&#x2014;oh, this misery will kill <lb/>
me!'</p>
<p>"'Bless you! bless you, sir, for these sweet words! <lb/>
<i>I</i>, too, suffer in this dear loss. Were you present <lb/>
during his last moments?'</p>
<p>"'Yes. I&#x2014;<i>whose</i> last moments?'</p>
<p>"'<i>His</i>. The dear departed's.'</p>
<p>"'Yes! Oh, yes&#x2014;yes&#x2014;<i>yes!</i> I suppose so, I <lb/>
think so, <i>I</i> don't know! Oh, certainly&#x2014;I was there <lb/>
&#x2014;<i>I</i> was there!'</p>
<p>"'Oh, what a privilege! what a precious privilege! <lb/>
And his last words&#x2014;oh, tell me, tell me his last words! <lb/>
What did he say?'</p>
<p>"'He said&#x2014;he said&#x2014;oh, my head, my head, my <lb/>
head! He said&#x2014;he said&#x2014;he never said <i>any</i>thing <lb/>
but Punch, punch, <i>punch</i> in the presence of the <lb/>
passenjare! Oh, leave me, madam! In the name of <lb/>
all that is generous, leave me to my madness, my <lb/>
misery, my despair!&#x2014;a buff trip slip for a six-cent <lb/>
fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare&#x2014;endu-rance <lb/>
<i>can</i> no fur-ther go!&#x2014;<smcap>punch</smcap> in the presence of the <lb/>
passenjare!'"</p>
<p>My friend's hopeless eyes rested upon mine a preg- <lb/>
nant minute, and then he said impressively:</p>
<p>"Mark, you do not say anything. You do not offer <lb/>
<pb n="340"/>
me any hope. But, ah me, it is just as well&#x2014;it is just <lb/>
as well. You could not do me any good. The time <lb/>
has long gone by when words could comfort me. <lb/>
Something tells me that my tongue is doomed to wag <lb/>
forever to the jigger of that remorseless jingle. There <lb/>
&#x2014;there it is coming on me again: a blue trip slip for <lb/>
an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Thus murmuring faint and fainter, my friend sank <lb/>
into a peaceful trance and forgot his sufferings in a <lb/>
blessed respite.</p>
<p>How did I finally save him from an asylum? I took <lb/>
him to a neighboring university and made him discharge <lb/>
the burden of his persecuting rhymes into the eager <lb/>
ears of the poor, unthinking students. How is it with <lb/>
<i>them</i>, now? The result is too sad to tell. Why did I <lb/>
write this article? It was for a worthy, even a noble, <lb/>
purpose. It was to warn you, reader, if you should <lb/>
come across those merciless rhymes, to avoid them&#x2014; <lb/>
avoid them as you would a pestilence!</p>

<head><b>THE GREAT REVOLUTION IN PITCAIRN</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>Let</smcap> me refresh the reader's memory a little. Nearly <lb/>
a hundred years ago the crew of the British ship <lb/>
<i>Bounty</i> mutinied, set the captain and his officers adrift <lb/>
upon the open sea, took possession of the ship, and <lb/>
sailed southward. They procured wives for themselves <lb/>
among the natives of Tahiti, then proceeded to a lonely <lb/>
little rock in mid-Pacific, called Pitcairn's Island, <lb/>
wrecked the vessel, stripped her of everything that <lb/>
might be useful to a new colony, and established them- <lb/>
selves on shore.</p>
<p>Pitcairn's is so far removed from the track of com- <lb/>
merce that it was many years before another vessel <lb/>
touched there. It had always been considered an un- <lb/>
inhabited island; so when a ship did at last drop its <lb/>
anchor there, in 1808, the captain was greatly surprised <lb/>
to find the place peopled. Although the mutineers <lb/>
had fought among themselves, and gradually killed <lb/>
each other off until only two or three of the original <lb/>
stock remained, these tragedies had not occurred be- <lb/>
fore a number of children had been born; so in 1808 <lb/>
the island had a population of twenty-seven persons. <lb/>
John Adams, the chief mutineer, still survived, and <lb/>
was to live many years yet, as governor and patriarch <lb/>
of the flock. From being mutineer and homicide, he <lb/>
had turned Christian and teacher, and his nation of <lb/>
<pb n="342"/>
twenty-seven persons was now the purest and devoutest <lb/>
in Christendom. Adams had long ago hoisted the <lb/>
British flag and constituted his island an appanage of <lb/>
the British crown.</p>
<p>To-day the population numbers ninety persons&#x2014; <lb/>
sixteen men, nineteen women, twenty-five boys, and <lb/>
thirty girls&#x2014;all descendants of the mutineers, all <lb/>
bearing the family names of those mutineers, and all <lb/>
speaking English, and English only. The island stands <lb/>
high up out of the sea, and has precipitous walls. It <lb/>
is about three quarters of a mile long, and in places is <lb/>
as much as half a mile wide. Such arable land as it <lb/>
affords is held by the several families, according to a <lb/>
division made many years ago. There is some live- <lb/>
stock&#x2014;goats, pigs, chickens, and cats; but no dogs, <lb/>
and no large animals. There is one church building&#x2014; <lb/>
used also as a capitol, a schoolhouse, and a public <lb/>
library. The title of the governor has been, for a <lb/>
generation or two, "Magistrate and Chief Ruler, in <lb/>
subordination to her Majesty the Queen of Great <lb/>
Britain." It was his province to <i>make</i> the laws, as <lb/>
well as execute them. His office was elective; every- <lb/>
body over seventeen years old had a vote&#x2014;no matter <lb/>
about the sex.</p>
<p>The sole occupations of the people were farming and <lb/>
fishing; their sole recreation, religious services. There <lb/>
has never been a shop in the island, nor any money. <lb/>
The habits and dress of the people have always been <lb/>
primitive, and their laws simple to puerility. They <lb/>
have lived in a deep Sabbath tranquillity, far from the <lb/>
world and its ambitions and vexations, and neither <lb/>
knowing nor caring what was going on in the mighty <lb/>
empires that lie beyond their limitless ocean solitudes. <lb/>
Once in three or four years a ship touched there, <lb/>
moved them with aged news of bloody battles, devas- <lb/>
tating epidemics, fallen thrones, and ruined dynasties, <lb/>
<pb n="343"/>
then traded them some soap and flannel for some yams <lb/>
and breadfruit, and sailed away, leaving them to retire <lb/>
into their peaceful dreams and pious dissipations once <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>On the 8th of last September, Admiral de Horsey, <lb/>
commander-in-chief of the British fleet in the Pacific, <lb/>
visited Pitcairn's Island, and speaks as follows in his <lb/>
official report to the admiralty: <lb/>
<q>They have beans, carrots, turnips, cabbages, and a little maize; pinc- <lb/>
apples, fig-trees, custard-apples, and oranges; lemons, and cocoa-nuts. <lb/>
Clothing is obtained alone from passing ships, in barter for refreshments. <lb/>
There are no springs on the island, but as it rains generally once a month <lb/>
they have plenty of water, although at times, in former years, they have <lb/>
suffered from drought. No alcoholic liquors, except for medicinal pur- <lb/>
poses, are used, and a drunkard is unknown.&#x2026;</q>
<q>The necessary articles required by the islanders are best shown by those <lb/>
we furnished in barter for refreshments: namely, flannel, serge, drill, half- <lb/>
boots, combs, tobacco, and soap. They also stand much in need of maps <lb/>
and slates for their school, and tools of any kind are most acceptable. I <lb/>
caused them to be supplied from the public stores with a union-jack for <lb/>
display on the arrival of ships, and a pit-saw, of which they were greatly in <lb/>
need. This, I trust, will meet the approval of their lordships. If the <lb/>
munificent people of England were only aware of the wants of this most <lb/>
deserving little colony, they would not long go unsupplied.&#x2026;</q>
<q>Divine service is held every Sunday at 10.30 <smcap>a.m.</smcap> and at 3 <smcap>p.m.</smcap>, in the <lb/>
house built and used by John Adams for that purpose until he died in 1829. <lb/>
It is conducted strictly in accordance with the liturgy of the Church of <lb/>
England, by Mr. Simon Young, their selected pastor, who is much re- <lb/>
spected. A Bible class is held every Wednesday, when all who conven- <lb/>
iently can attend. There is also a general meeting for prayer on the first <lb/>
Friday in every month. Family prayers are said in every house the first <lb/>
thing in the morning and the last thing in the evening, and no food is par- <lb/>
taken of without asking God's blessing before and afterwards. Of these <lb/>
islanders' religious attributes no one can speak without deep respect. A <lb/>
people whose greatest pleasure and privilege is to commune in prayer with <lb/>
their God, and to join in hymns of praise, and who are, moreover, cheerful, <lb/>
diligent, and probably freer from vice than any other community, need no <lb/>
priest among them.</q></p>
<pb n="344"/>
<p>Now I come to a sentence in the admiral's report <lb/>
which he dropped carelessly from his pen, no doubt, <lb/>
and never gave the matter a second thought. He little <lb/>
imagined what a freight of tragic prophecy it bore! <lb/>
This is the sentence: <lb/>
<q>One stranger, an American, has settled on the island&#x2014;<i>a doubtful <lb/>
acquisition</i>.</q></p>
<p>A doubtful acquisition, indeed! Captain Ormsby, <lb/>
in the American ship <i>Hornet</i>, touched at Pitcairn's <lb/>
nearly four months after the admiral's visit, and from <lb/>
the facts which he gathered there we now know all <lb/>
about that American. Let us put these facts together <lb/>
in historical form. The American's name was Butter- <lb/>
worth Stavely. As soon as he had become well ac- <lb/>
quainted with all the people&#x2014;and this took but a few <lb/>
days, of course&#x2014;he began to ingratiate himself with <lb/>
them by all the arts he could command. He became <lb/>
exceedingly popular, and much looked up to; for one <lb/>
of the first things he did was to forsake his worldly way <lb/>
of life, and throw all his energies into religion. He was <lb/>
always reading his Bible, or praying, or singing hymns, <lb/>
or asking blessings. In prayer, no one had such <lb/>
"liberty" as he, no one could pray so long or so well.</p>
<p>At last, when he considered the time to be ripe, he <lb/>
began secretly to sow the seeds of discontent among <lb/>
the people. It was his deliberate purpose, from the <lb/>
beginning, to subvert the government, but of course he <lb/>
kept that to himself for a time. He used different arts <lb/>
with different individuals. He awakened dissatisfaction <lb/>
in one quarter by calling attention to the shortness of <lb/>
the Sunday services; he argued that there should be <lb/>
three three-hour services on Sunday instead of only <lb/>
two. Many had secretly held this opinion before; <lb/>
they now privately banded themselves into a party to <lb/>
work for it. He showed certain of the women that <lb/>
<pb n="345"/>
they were not allowed sufficient voice in the prayer- <lb/>
meetings; thus another party was formed. No weapon <lb/>
was beneath his notice; he even descended to the chil- <lb/>
dren, and awoke discontent in their breasts because&#x2014; <lb/>
as <i>he</i> discovered for them&#x2014;they had not enough <lb/>
Sunday-school. This created a third party.</p>
<p>Now, as the chief of these parties, he found himself <lb/>
the strongest power in the community. So he pro- <lb/>
ceeded to his next move&#x2014;a no less important one <lb/>
than the impeachment of the chief magistrate, James <lb/>
Russell Nickoy; a man of character and ability, and <lb/>
possessed of great wealth, he being the owner of a <lb/>
house with a parlor to it, three acres and a half of yam <lb/>
land, and the only boat in Pitcairn's, a whale-boat; <lb/>
and, most unfortunately, a pretext for this impeach- <lb/>
ment offered itself at just the right time. One of the <lb/>
earliest and most precious laws of the island was the <lb/>
law against trespass. It was held in great reverence, <lb/>
and was regarded as the palladium of the people's <lb/>
liberties. About thirty years ago an important case <lb/>
came before the courts under this law, in this wise: a <lb/>
chicken belonging to Elizabeth Young (aged, at that <lb/>
time, fifty-eight, a daughter of John Mills, one of the <lb/>
mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i>) trespassed upon the grounds <lb/>
of Thursday October Christian (aged twenty-nine, a <lb/>
grandson of Fletcher Christian, one of the mutineers). <lb/>
Christian killed the chicken. According to the law, <lb/>
Christian could keep the chicken; or, if he preferred, <lb/>
he could restore its remains to the owner, and receive <lb/>
damages in "produce" to an amount equivalent to <lb/>
the waste and injury wrought by the trespasser. The <lb/>
court records set forth that "the said Christian afore- <lb/>
said did deliver the aforesaid remains to the said Eliza- <lb/>
beth Young, and did demand one bushel of yams in <lb/>
satisfaction of the damage done." But Elizabeth <lb/>
Young considered the demand exorbitant; the parties <lb/>
<pb n="346"/>
could not agree; therefore Christian brought suit in <lb/>
the courts. He lost his case in the justice's court; at <lb/>
least, he was awarded only a half peck of yams, which <lb/>
he considered insufficient, and in the nature of a <lb/>
defeat. He appealed. The case lingered several years <lb/>
in an ascending grade of courts, and always resulted in <lb/>
decrees sustaining the original verdict; and finally the <lb/>
thing got into the supreme court, and there it stuck for <lb/>
twenty years. But last summer, even the supreme <lb/>
court managed to arrive at a decision at last. Once <lb/>
more the original verdict was sustained. Christian then <lb/>
said he was satisfied; but Stavely was present, and <lb/>
whispered to him and to his lawyer, suggesting, "as a <lb/>
mere form," that the original law be exhibited, in <lb/>
order to make sure that it still existed. It seemed an <lb/>
odd idea, but an ingenious one. So the demand was <lb/>
made. A messenger was sent to the magistrate's <lb/>
house; he presently returned with the tidings that it <lb/>
had disappeared from among the state archives.</p>
<p>The court now pronounced its late decision void, <lb/>
since it had been made under a law which had no actual <lb/>
existence.</p>
<p>Great excitement ensued immediately. The news <lb/>
swept abroad over the whole island that the palladium <lb/>
of the public liberties was lost&#x2014;maybe treasonably <lb/>
destroyed. Within thirty minutes almost the entire <lb/>
nation were in the courtroom&#x2014;that is to say, the <lb/>
church. The impeachment of the chief magistrate <lb/>
followed, upon Stavely's motion. The accused met <lb/>
his misfortune with the dignity which became his great <lb/>
office. He did not plead, or even argue; he offered <lb/>
the simple defense that he had not meddled with the <lb/>
missing law; that he had kept the state archives in the <lb/>
same candle-box that had been used as their depository <lb/>
from the beginning; and that he was innocent of the <lb/>
removal or destruction of the lost document.</p>
<pb n="347"/>
<p>But nothing could save him; he was found guilty of <lb/>
misprision of treason, and degraded from his office, and <lb/>
all his property was confiscated.</p>
<p>The lamest part of the whole shameful matter was <lb/>
the <i>reason</i> suggested by his enemies for his destruction <lb/>
of the law, to wit: that he did it to favor Christian, <lb/>
because Christian was his cousin! Whereas Stavely <lb/>
was the only individual in the entire nation who was <lb/>
<i>not</i> his cousin. The reader must remember that all <lb/>
these people are the descendants of half a dozen men; <lb/>
that the first children intermarried together and bore <lb/>
grandchildren to the mutineers; that these grand- <lb/>
children intermarried; after them, great and great- <lb/>
great-grandchildren intermarried; so that to-day every- <lb/>
body is blood kin to everybody. Moreover, the rela- <lb/>
tionships are wonderfully, even astoundingly, mixed <lb/>
up and complicated. A stranger, for instance, says to <lb/>
an islander:</p>
<p>"You speak of that young woman as your cousin; <lb/>
a while ago you called her your aunt."</p>
<p>"Well, she <i>is</i> my aunt, and my cousin, too. And <lb/>
also my step-sister, my niece, my fourth cousin, my <lb/>
thirty-third cousin, my forty-second cousin, my great- <lb/>
aunt, my grandmother; my widowed sister-in-law&#x2014; <lb/>
and next week she will be my wife."</p>
<p>So the charge of nepotism against the chief magis- <lb/>
trate was weak. But no matter; weak or strong, it <lb/>
suited Stavely. Stavely was immediately elected to the <lb/>
vacant magistracy, and, oozing reform from every <lb/>
pore, he went vigorously to work. In no long time <lb/>
religious services raged everywhere and unceasingly. <lb/>
By command, the second prayer of the Sunday morn- <lb/>
ing service, which had customarily endured some thirty- <lb/>
five or forty minutes, and had pleaded for the world, <lb/>
first by continent and then by national and tribal detail, <lb/>
was extended to an hour and a half, and made to in- <lb/>
<pb n="348"/>
clude supplications in behalf of the possible peoples in <lb/>
the several planets. Everybody was pleased with this; <lb/>
everybody said, "Now <i>this</i> is something <i>like</i>." By <lb/>
command, the usual three-hour sermons were doubled <lb/>
in length. The nation came in a body to testify their <lb/>
gratitude to the new magistrate. The old law for- <lb/>
bidding cooking on the Sabbath was extended to the <lb/>
prohibition of eating, also. By command, Sunday- <lb/>
school was privileged to spread over into the week. <lb/>
The joy of all classes was complete. In one short <lb/>
month the new magistrate had become the people's <lb/>
idol!</p>
<p>The time was ripe for this man's next move. He <lb/>
began, cautiously at first, to poison the public mind <lb/>
against England. He took the chief citizens aside, <lb/>
one by one, and conversed with them on this topic. <lb/>
Presently he grew bolder, and spoke out. He said the <lb/>
nation owed it to itself, to its honor, to its great tradi- <lb/>
tions, to rise in its might and throw off "this galling <lb/>
English yoke."</p>
<p>But the simple islanders answered:</p>
<p>"We had not noticed that it galled. How does it <lb/>
gall? England sends a ship once in three or four years <lb/>
to give us soap and clothing, and things which we <lb/>
sorely need and gratefully receive; but she never <lb/>
troubles us; she lets us go our own way."</p>
<p>"She lets you go your own way! So slaves have <lb/>
felt and spoken in all the ages! This speech shows <lb/>
how fallen you are, how base, how brutalized you <lb/>
have become, under this grinding tyranny! What! <lb/>
has all manly pride forsaken you? Is liberty nothing? <lb/>
Are you content to be a mere appendage to a foreign <lb/>
and hateful sovereignty, when you might rise up and <lb/>
take your rightful place in the august family of nations, <lb/>
great, free, enlightened, independent, the minion of no <lb/>
sceptered master, but the arbiter of your own destiny, <lb/>
<pb n="349"/>
and a voice and a power in decreeing the destinies of <lb/>
your sister-sovereignties of the world?"</p>
<p>Speeches like this produced an effect by and by <lb/>
Citizens began to feel the English yoke; they did not <lb/>
know exactly how or whereabouts they felt it, but they <lb/>
were perfectly certain they did feel it. They got to <lb/>
grumbling a good deal, and chafing under their chains, <lb/>
and longing for relief and release. They presently fell <lb/>
to hating the English flag, that sign and symbol of their <lb/>
nation's degradation; they ceased to glance up at it as <lb/>
they passed the capitol, but averted their eyes and <lb/>
grated their teeth; and one morning, when it was <lb/>
found trampled into the mud at the foot of the staff, <lb/>
they left it there, and no man put his hand to it to <lb/>
hoist it again. A certain thing which was sure to hap- <lb/>
pen sooner or later happened now. Some of the chief <lb/>
citizens went to the magistrate by night, and said:</p>
<p>"We can endure this hated tyranny no longer. How <lb/>
can we cast it off?"</p>
<p>"By a <foreign lang="fre"><i>coup d'&#x00E9;tat</i>."</foreign></p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"A <foreign lang="fre">coup d'&#x00E9;tat.</foreign> It is like this: everything is got <lb/>
ready, and at the appointed moment I, as the official <lb/>
head of the nation, publicly and solemnly proclaim its <lb/>
independence, and absolve it from allegiance to any <lb/>
and all other powers whatsoever."</p>
<p>"That sounds simple and easy. We can do that <lb/>
right away. Then what will be the next thing to do?"</p>
<p>"Seize all the defenses and public properties of all <lb/>
kinds, establish martial law, put the army and navy on <lb/>
a war footing, and proclaim the empire!"</p>
<p>This fine program dazzled these innocents. They <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"This is grand&#x2014;this is splendid; but will not Eng- <lb/>
land resist?"</p>
<p>"Let her. This rock is a Gibraltar."</p>
<pb n="350"/>
<p>"True. But about the empire? Do we <i>need</i> an <lb/>
empire and an emperor?"</p>
<p>"What you <i>need</i>, my friends, is unification. Look <lb/>
at Germany; look at Italy. They are unified. Unifi- <lb/>
cation is the thing. It makes living dear. That con- <lb/>
stitutes progress. We must have a standing army, and <lb/>
a navy. Taxes follow, as a matter of course. All <lb/>
these things summed up make grandeur. With unifica- <lb/>
tion and grandeur, what more can you want? Very <lb/>
well&#x2014;only the empire can confer these boons."</p>
<p>So on the 8th day of December Pitcairn's Island was <lb/>
proclaimed a free and independent nation; and on the <lb/>
same day the solemn coronation of Butterworth I., <lb/>
emperor of Pitcairn's Island, took place, amid great re- <lb/>
joicings and festivities. The entire nation, with the ex- <lb/>
ception of fourteen persons, mainly little children, <lb/>
marched past the throne in single file, with banners and <lb/>
music, the procession being upwards of ninety feet <lb/>
long; and some said it was as much as three-quarters <lb/>
of a minute passing a given point. Nothing like it had <lb/>
ever been seen in the history of the island before. <lb/>
Public enthusiasm was measureless.</p>
<p>Now straightway imperial reforms began. Orders of <lb/>
nobility were instituted. A minister of the navy was <lb/>
appointed, and the whale-boat put in commission. A <lb/>
minister of war was created, and ordered to proceed at <lb/>
once with the formation of a standing army. A first <lb/>
lord of the treasury was named, and commanded to get <lb/>
up a taxation scheme, and also open negotiations for <lb/>
treaties, offensive, defensive, and commercial, with for- <lb/>
eign powers. Some generals and admirals were ap- <lb/>
pointed; also some chamberlains, some equerries in <lb/>
waiting, and some lords of the bedchamber.</p>
<p>At this point all the material was used up. The <lb/>
Grand Duke of Galilee, minister of war, complained <lb/>
that all the sixteen grown men in the empire had been <lb/>
<pb n="351"/>
given great offices, and consequently would not consent <lb/>
to serve in the ranks; wherefore his standing army was <lb/>
at a standstill. The Marquis of Ararat, minister of the <lb/>
navy, made a similar complaint. He said he was will- <lb/>
ing to steer the whale-boat himself, but he <i>must</i> have <lb/>
somebody to man her.</p>
<p>The emperor did the best he could in the circum- <lb/>
stances: he took all the boys above the age of ten years <lb/>
away from their mothers, and pressed them into the <lb/>
army, thus constructing a corps of seventeen privates, <lb/>
officered by one lieutenant-general and two major-gen- <lb/>
erals. This pleased the minister of war, but procured <lb/>
the enmity of all the mothers in the land; for they said <lb/>
their precious ones must now find bloody graves in the <lb/>
fields of war, and he would be answerable for it. Some <lb/>
of the more heartbroken and unappeasable among <lb/>
them lay constantly in wait for the emperor and threw <lb/>
yams at him, unmindful of the bodyguard.</p>
<p>On account of the extreme scarcity of material, it <lb/>
was found necessary to require the Duke of Bethany, <lb/>
postmaster-general, to pull stroke-oar in the navy, and <lb/>
thus sit in the rear of a noble of lower degree, namely, <lb/>
Viscount Canaan, lord justice of the common pleas. <lb/>
This turned the Duke of Bethany into a tolerably open <lb/>
malcontent and a secret conspirator&#x2014;a thing which <lb/>
the emperor foresaw, but could not help.</p>
<p>Things went from bad to worse. The emperor raised <lb/>
Nancy Peters to the peerage on one day, and married <lb/>
her the next, notwithstanding, for reasons of state, the <lb/>
cabinet had strenuously advised him to marry Emme- <lb/>
line, eldest daughter of the Archbishop of Bethlehem. <lb/>
This caused trouble in a powerful quarter&#x2014;the church. <lb/>
The new empress secured the support and friendship of <lb/>
two-thirds of the thirty-six grown women in the nation <lb/>
by absorbing them into her court as maids of honor; <lb/>
but this made deadly enemies of the remaining twelve. <lb/>
<pb n="352"/>
The families of the maids of honor soon began to rebel, <lb/>
because there was nobody at home to keep house. <lb/>
The twelve snubbed women refused to enter the im- <lb/>
perial kitchen as servants; so the empress had to require <lb/>
the Countess of Jericho and other great court dames to <lb/>
fetch water, sweep the palace, and perform other menial <lb/>
and equally distasteful services. This made bad blood <lb/>
in that department.</p>
<p>Everybody fell to complaining that the taxes levied <lb/>
for the support of the army, the navy, and the rest of <lb/>
the imperial establishment were intolerably burdensome, <lb/>
and were reducing the nation to beggary. The em- <lb/>
peror's reply&#x2014;"Look at Germany; look at Italy. Are <lb/>
you better than they? and haven't you unification?"&#x2014; <lb/>
did not satisfy them. They said, "People can't <i>eat</i> <lb/>
unification, and we are starving. Agriculture has <lb/>
ceased. Everybody is in the army, everybody is in the <lb/>
navy, everybody is in the public service, standing <lb/>
around in a uniform, with nothing whatever to do, <lb/>
nothing to eat, and nobody to till the fields&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Look at Germany; look at Italy. It is the same <lb/>
there. Such is unification, and there's no other way <lb/>
to get it&#x2014;no other way to keep it after you've got it," <lb/>
said the poor emperor always.</p>
<p>But the grumblers only replied, "We can't <i>stand</i> the <lb/>
taxes&#x2014;we can't <i>stand</i> them."</p>
<p>Now right on top of this the cabinet reported a <lb/>
national debt amounting to upwards of forty-five dol- <lb/>
lars&#x2014;half a dollar to every individual in the nation. <lb/>
And they proposed to fund something. They had <lb/>
heard that this was always done in such emergencies. <lb/>
They proposed duties on exports; also on imports. <lb/>
And they wanted to issue bonds; also paper money, <lb/>
redeemable in yams and cabbages in fifty years. They <lb/>
said the pay of the army and of the navy and of the <lb/>
whole governmental machine was far in arrears, and <lb/>
<pb n="353"/>
unless something was done, and done immediately, <lb/>
national bankruptcy must ensue, and possibly insurrec- <lb/>
tion and revolution. The emperor at once resolved <lb/>
upon a high-handed measure, and one of a nature never <lb/>
before heard of in Pitcairn's Island. He went in state <lb/>
to the church on Sunday morning, with the army at his <lb/>
back, and commanded the minister of the treasury to <lb/>
take up a collection.</p>
<p>That was the feather that broke the camel's back. <lb/>
First one citizen, and then another, rose and refused <lb/>
to submit to this unheard-of outrage&#x2014;and each refusal <lb/>
was followed by the immediate confiscation of the <lb/>
malcontent's property. This vigor soon stopped the <lb/>
refusals, and the collection proceeded amid a sullen and <lb/>
ominous silence. As the emperor withdrew with the <lb/>
troops, he said, "I will teach you who is master here." <lb/>
Several persons shouted, "Down with unification!" <lb/>
They were at once arrested and torn from the arms of <lb/>
their weeping friends by the soldiery.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, as any prophet might have fore- <lb/>
seen, a Social Democrat had been developed. As the <lb/>
emperor stepped into the gilded imperial wheelbarrow <lb/>
at the church door, the social democrat stabbed at him <lb/>
fifteen or sixteen times with a harpoon, but fortunately <lb/>
with such a peculiarly social democratic unprecision of <lb/>
aim as to do no damage.</p>
<p>That very night the convulsion came. The nation <lb/>
rose as one man&#x2014;though forty-nine of the revolu- <lb/>
tionists were of the other sex. The infantry threw <lb/>
down their pitchforks; the artillery cast aside their <lb/>
cocoanuts; the navy revolted; the emperor was seized, <lb/>
and bound hand and foot in his palace. He was very <lb/>
much depressed. He said:</p>
<p>"I freed you from a grinding tyranny; I lifted you <lb/>
up out of your degradation, and made you a nation <lb/>
among nations; I gave you a strong, compact, cen- <lb/>
<pb n="354"/>
tralized government; and, more than all, I gave you <lb/>
the blessing of blessings,&#x2014;unification. I have done all <lb/>
this, and my reward is hatred, insult, and these bonds. <lb/>
Take me; do with me as you will. I here resign my <lb/>
crown and all my dignities, and gladly do I release my- <lb/>
self from their too heavy burden. For your sake I took <lb/>
them up; for your sake I lay them down. The im- <lb/>
perial jewel is no more; now bruise and defile as ye will <lb/>
the useless setting."</p>
<p>By a unanimous voice the people condemned the ex- <lb/>
emperor and the social democrat to perpetual banish- <lb/>
ment from church services, or to perpetual labor as <lb/>
galley-slaves in the whale-boat&#x2014;whichever they might <lb/>
prefer. The next day the nation assembled again, and <lb/>
rehoisted the British flag, reinstated the British tyranny, <lb/>
reduced the nobility to the condition of commoners <lb/>
again, and then straightway turned their diligent atten- <lb/>
tion to the weeding of the ruined and neglected yam <lb/>
patches, and the rehabilitation of the old useful indus- <lb/>
tries and the old healing and solacing pieties. The ex- <lb/>
emperor restored the lost trespass law, and explained <lb/>
that he had stolen it&#x2014;not to injure any one, but to <lb/>
further his political projects. Therefore the nation gave <lb/>
the late chief magistrate his office again, and also his <lb/>
alienated property.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, the ex-emperor and the social demo- <lb/>
crat chose perpetual banishment from religious services <lb/>
in preference to perpetual labor as galley-slaves "<i>with</i> <lb/>
perpetual religious services," as they phrased it; <lb/>
wherefore the people believed that the poor fellows' <lb/>
troubles had unseated their reason, and so they judged <lb/>
it best to confine them for the present. Which they <lb/>
did.</p>
<p>Such is the history of Pitcairn's "doubtful acquisi- <lb/>
tion."</p>

<head><b>ON THE DECAY OF THE ART OF <lb/>
LYING</b></head>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>Observe</smcap>, I do not mean to suggest that the <i>custom</i> <lb/>
of lying has suffered any decay or interruption&#x2014; <lb/>
no, for the Lie, as a Virtue, a Principle, is eternal; the <lb/>
Lie, as a recreation, a solace, a refuge in time of need, <lb/>
the fourth Grace, the tenth Muse, man's best and surest <lb/>
friend, is immortal, and cannot perish from the earth <lb/>
while this Club remains. My complaint simply con- <lb/>
cerns the decay of the <i>art</i> of lying. No high-minded <lb/>
man, no man of right feeling, can contemplate the <lb/>
lumbering and slovenly lying of the present day with- <lb/>
out grieving to see a noble art so prostituted. In this <lb/>
veteran presence I naturally enter upon this scheme <lb/>
with diffidence; it is like an old maid trying to teach <lb/>
nursery matters to the mothers in Israel. It would not <lb/>
become me to criticise you, gentlemen, who are nearly <lb/>
all my elders&#x2014;and my superiors, in this thing&#x2014;and <lb/>
so, if I should here and there <i>seem</i> to do it, I trust it <lb/>
will in most cases be more in a spirit of admiration than <lb/>
<pb n="356"/>
of fault-finding; indeed, if this finest of the fine arts had <lb/>
everywhere received the attention, encouragement, and <lb/>
conscientious practice and development which this <lb/>
Club has devoted to it, I should not need to utter this <lb/>
lament, or shed a single tear. I do not say this to <lb/>
flatter: I say it in a spirit of just and appreciative <lb/>
recognition.</p>
<p>[It had been my intention, at this point, to mention <lb/>
names and give illustrative specimens, but indications <lb/>
observable about me admonished me to beware of par- <lb/>
ticulars and confine myself to generalities.]</p>
<p>No fact is more firmly established than that lying is <lb/>
a necessity of our circumstances&#x2014;the deduction that <lb/>
it is then a Virtue goes without saying. No virtue <lb/>
can reach its highest usefulness without careful and <lb/>
diligent cultivation&#x2014;therefore, it goes without saying, <lb/>
that this one ought to be taught in the public schools <lb/>
&#x2014;at the fireside&#x2014;even in the newspapers. What <lb/>
chance has the ignorant, uncultivated liar against the <lb/>
educated expert? What chance have I against Mr. Per <lb/>
&#x2014;against a lawyer? <i>Judicious</i> lying is what the world <lb/>
needs. I sometimes think it were even better and safer <lb/>
not to lie at all than to lie injudiciously. An awkward, <lb/>
unscientific lie is often as ineffectual as the truth.</p>
<p>Now let us see what the philosophers say. Note <lb/>
that venerable proverb: Children and fools <i>always</i> <lb/>
speak the truth. The deduction is plain&#x2014;adults and <lb/>
wise persons <i>never</i> speak it. Parkman, the historian, <lb/>
says, "The principle of truth may itself be carried into <lb/>
an absurdity." In another place in the same chapter <lb/>
he says, "The saying is old that truth should not be <lb/>
spoken at all times; and those whom a sick conscience <lb/>
worries into habitual violation of the maxim are im- <lb/>
beciles and nuisances." It is strong language, but true. <lb/>
None of us could <i>live</i> with an habitual truth-teller; <lb/>
but, thank goodness, none of us has to. An habitual <lb/>
<pb n="357"/>
truth-teller is simply an impossible creature; he does <lb/>
not exist; he never has existed. Of course there are <lb/>
people who <i>think</i> they never lie, but it is not so&#x2014;and <lb/>
this ignorance is one of the very things that shame our <lb/>
so-called civilization. Everybody lies&#x2014;every day; <lb/>
every hour; awake; asleep; in his dreams; in his joy; in <lb/>
his mourning; if he keeps his tongue still, his hands, his <lb/>
feet, his eyes, his attitude, will convey deception&#x2014;and <lb/>
purposely. Even in sermons&#x2014;but that is a platitude.</p>
<p>In a far country where I once lived the ladies used <lb/>
to go around paying calls, under the humane and <lb/>
kindly pretense of wanting to see each other; and when <lb/>
they returned home, they would cry out with a glad <lb/>
voice, saying, "We made sixteen calls and found four- <lb/>
teen of them out"&#x2014;not meaning that they found out <lb/>
anything against the fourteen&#x2014;no, that was only a col- <lb/>
loquial phrase to signify that they were not at home&#x2014; <lb/>
and their manner of saying it expressed their lively sat- <lb/>
isfaction in that fact. Now their pretense of wanting to <lb/>
see the fourteen&#x2014;and the other two whom they had <lb/>
been less lucky with&#x2014;was that commonest and mildest <lb/>
form of lying which is sufficiently described as a deflec- <lb/>
tion from the truth. Is it justifiable? Most certainly. <lb/>
It is beautiful, it is noble; for its object is, <i>not</i> to reap <lb/>
profit, but to convey a pleasure to the sixteen. The <lb/>
iron-souled truth-monger would plainly manifest, or <lb/>
even utter the fact that he didn't want to see those <lb/>
people&#x2014;and he would be an ass, and inflict a totally <lb/>
unnecessary pain. And next, those ladies in that far <lb/>
country&#x2014;but never mind, they had a thousand pleasant <lb/>
ways of lying, that grew out of gentle impulses, and <lb/>
were a credit to their intelligence and an honor to their <lb/>
hearts. Let the particulars go.</p>
<p>The men in that far country were liars, every one. <lb/>
Their mere howdy-do was a lie, because <i>they</i> didn't <lb/>
care how you did, except they were undertakers. To <lb/>
<pb n="358"/>
the ordinary inquirer you lied in return; for you made <lb/>
no conscientious diagnosis of your case, but answered <lb/>
at random, and usually missed it considerably. You <lb/>
lied to the undertaker, and said your health was failing <lb/>
&#x2014;a wholly commendable lie, since it cost you nothing <lb/>
and pleased the other man. If a stranger called and <lb/>
interrupted you, you said with your hearty tongue, <lb/>
"I'm glad to see you," and said with your heartier <lb/>
soul, "I wish you were with the cannibals and it was <lb/>
dinner-time." When he went, you said regretfully, <lb/>
"<i>Must</i> you go?" and followed it with a "Call again;" <lb/>
but you did no harm, for you did not deceive anybody <lb/>
nor inflict any hurt, whereas the truth would have made <lb/>
you both unhappy.</p>
<p>I think that all this courteous lying is a sweet and lov- <lb/>
ing art, and should be cultivated. The highest perfec- <lb/>
tion of politeness is only a beautiful edifice, built, from <lb/>
the base to the dome, of graceful and gilded forms of <lb/>
charitable and unselfish lying.</p>
<p>What I bemoan is the growing prevalence of the <lb/>
brutal truth. Let us do what we can to eradicate it. <lb/>
An injurious truth has no merit over an injurious lie. <lb/>
Neither should ever be uttered. The man who speaks <lb/>
an injurious truth, lest his soul be not saved if he do <lb/>
otherwise, should reflect that that sort of a soul is not <lb/>
strictly worth saving. The man who tells a lie to help <lb/>
a poor devil out of trouble, is one of whom the angels <lb/>
doubtless say, "Lo, here is an heroic soul who casts <lb/>
his own welfare into jeopardy to succor his neighbor's; <lb/>
let us exalt this magnanimous liar."</p>
<p>An injurious lie is an uncommendable thing; and so, <lb/>
also, and in the same degree, is an injurious truth&#x2014;a <lb/>
fact which is recognized by the law of libel.</p>
<p>Among other common lies, we have the <i>silent</i> lie&#x2014; <lb/>
the deception which one conveys by simply keeping <lb/>
still and concealing the truth. Many obstinate truth- <lb/>
<pb n="359"/>
mongers indulge in this dissipation, imagining that if <lb/>
they <i>speak</i> no lie, they lie not at all. In that far <lb/>
country where I once lived, there was a lovely spirit, a <lb/>
lady whose impulses were always high and pure, and <lb/>
whose character answered to them. One day I was <lb/>
there at dinner, and remarked, in a general way, that <lb/>
we are all liars. She was amazed, and said, "Not <lb/>
<i>all?</i>" It was before "Pinafore's" time, so I did not <lb/>
make the response which would naturally follow in our <lb/>
day, but frankly said, "Yes, <i>all</i>&#x2014;we are all liars; <lb/>
there are no exceptions." She looked almost offended, <lb/>
and said, "Why, do you include <i>me?</i>" "Certainly," <lb/>
I said, "I think you even rank as an expert." She <lb/>
said, "'Sh&#x2014;'sh! the children!" So the subject was <lb/>
changed in deference to the children's presence, and <lb/>
we went on talking about other things. But as soon <lb/>
as the young people were out of the way, the lady <lb/>
came warmly back to the matter and said, "I have <lb/>
made it the rule of my life to never tell a lie; and I <lb/>
have never departed from it in a single instance." I <lb/>
said, "I don't mean the least harm or disrespect, <lb/>
but really you have been lying like smoke ever since <lb/>
I've been sitting here. It has caused me a good <lb/>
deal of pain, because I am not used to it." She re- <lb/>
quired of me an instance&#x2014;just a single instance. So <lb/>
I said:</p>
<p>"Well, here is the unfilled duplicate of the blank <lb/>
which the Oakland hospital people sent to you by the <lb/>
hand of the sick-nurse when she came here to nurse <lb/>
your little nephew through his dangerous illness. This <lb/>
blank asks all manner of questions as to the conduct of <lb/>
that sick-nurse: 'Did she ever sleep on her watch? <lb/>
Did she ever forget to give the medicine?' and so forth <lb/>
and so on. You are warned to be very careful and ex- <lb/>
plicit in your answers, for the welfare of the service re- <lb/>
quires that the nurses be promptly fined or otherwise <lb/>
<pb n="360"/>
punished for derelictions. You told me you were per- <lb/>
fectly delighted with that nurse&#x2014;that she had a thou- <lb/>
sand perfections and only one fault: you found you <lb/>
never could depend on her wrapping Johnny up half <lb/>
sufficiently while he waited in a chilly chair for her to <lb/>
rearrange the warm bed. You filled up the duplicate of <lb/>
this paper, and sent it back to the hospital by the hand <lb/>
of the nurse. How did you answer this question&#x2014; <lb/>
'Was the nurse at any time guilty of a negligence which <lb/>
was likely to result in the patient's taking cold?' Come <lb/>
&#x2014;everything is decided by a bet here in California: <lb/>
ten dollars to ten cents you lied when you answered <lb/>
that question." She said, "I didn't; <i>I left it blank!</i>" <lb/>
"Just so&#x2014;you have told a <i>silent</i> lie; you have left it <lb/>
to be inferred that you had no fault to find in that <lb/>
matter." She said, "Oh, was that a lie? And how <lb/>
<i>could</i> I mention her one single fault, and she so good? <lb/>
&#x2014;it would have been cruel." I said, "One ought <lb/>
always to lie, when one can do good by it; your im- <lb/>
pulse was right, but your judgment was crude; this <lb/>
comes of unintelligent practice. Now observe the re- <lb/>
sult of this inexpert deflection of yours. You know <lb/>
Mr. Jones's Willie is lying very low with scarlet fever; <lb/>
well, your recommendation was so enthusiastic that <lb/>
that girl is there nursing him, and the worn-out family <lb/>
have all been trustingly sound asleep for the last four- <lb/>
teen hours, leaving their darling with full confidence <lb/>
in those fatal hands, because you, like young George <lb/>
Washington, have a reputa&#x2014;However, if you are <lb/>
not going to have anything to do, I will come around <lb/>
to-morrow and we'll attend the funeral together, for, <lb/>
of course, you'll naturally feel a peculiar interest in <lb/>
Willie's case&#x2014;as personal a one, in fact, as the <lb/>
undertaker."</p>
<p>But that was all lost. Before I was half-way through <lb/>
she was in a carriage and making thirty miles an hour <lb/>
<pb n="361"/>
toward the Jones mansion to save what was left of Willie <lb/>
and tell all she knew about the deadly nurse. All of <lb/>
which was unnecessary, as Willie wasn't sick; I had <lb/>
been lying myself. But that same day, all the same, <lb/>
she sent a line to the hospital which filled up the <lb/>
neglected blank, and stated the <i>facts</i>, too, in the <lb/>
squarest possible manner.</p>
<p>Now, you see, this lady's fault was <i>not</i> in lying, but <lb/>
only in lying injudiciously. She should have told the <lb/>
truth, <i>there</i>, and made it up to the nurse with a fraud- <lb/>
ulent compliment further along in the paper. She <lb/>
could have said, "In one respect the sick-nurse is per- <lb/>
fection&#x2014;when she is on watch, she never snores." <lb/>
Almost any little pleasant lie would have taken the <lb/>
sting out of that troublesome but necessary expression <lb/>
of the truth.</p>
<p>Lying is universal&#x2014;we <i>all</i> do it; we all <i>must</i> do it. <lb/>
Therefore, the wise thing is for us diligently to train <lb/>
ourselves to lie thoughtfully, judiciously; to lie with <lb/>
a good object, and not an evil one; to lie for others' <lb/>
advantage, and not our own; to lie healingly, chari- <lb/>
tably, humanely, not cruelly, hurtfully, maliciously; to <lb/>
lie gracefully and graciously, not awkwardly and clum- <lb/>
sily; to lie firmly, frankly, squarely, with head erect, <lb/>
not haltingly, tortuously, with pusillanimous mien, as <lb/>
being ashamed of our high calling. Then shall we be <lb/>
rid of the rank and pestilent truth that is rotting the <lb/>
land; then shall we be great and good and beautiful, <lb/>
and worthy dwellers in a world where even benign <lb/>
Nature habitually lies, except when she promises ex- <lb/>
ecrable weather. Then&#x2014;But I am but a new and <lb/>
feeble student in this gracious art; I cannot instruct <lb/>
<i>this</i> Club.</p>
<p>Joking aside, I think there is much need of wise ex- <lb/>
amination into what sorts of lies are best and whole- <lb/>
somest to be indulged, seeing we <i>must</i> all lie and <i>do</i> all <lb/>
<pb n="362"/>
lie, and what sorts it may be best to avoid&#x2014;and this <lb/>
is a thing which I feel I can confidently put into the <lb/>
hands of this experienced Club&#x2014;a ripe body, who <lb/>
may be termed, in this regard, and without undue flat- <lb/>
tery, Old Masters.</p>

<head><b>THE CANVASSER'S TALE</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>Poor</smcap>, sad-eyed stranger! There was that about <lb/>
his humble mien, his tired look, his decayed-gen- <lb/>
tility clothes, that almost reached the mustard seed of <lb/>
charity that still remained, remote and lonely, in the <lb/>
empty vastness of my heart, notwithstanding I observed <lb/>
a portfolio under his arm, and said to myself, Behold, <lb/>
Providence hath delivered his servant into the hands of <lb/>
another canvasser.</p>
<p>Well, these people always get one interested. Be- <lb/>
fore I well knew how it came about, this one was telling <lb/>
me his history, and I was all attention and sympathy. <lb/>
He told it something like this:</p>
<p>My parents died, alas, when I was a little, sinless <lb/>
child. My uncle Ithuriel took me to his heart and <lb/>
reared me as his own. He was my only relative in the <lb/>
wide world; but he was good and rich and generous. <lb/>
He reared me in the lap of luxury. I knew no want <lb/>
that money could satisfy.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time I was graduated, and went with <lb/>
two of my servants&#x2014;my chamberlain and my valet&#x2014; <lb/>
to travel in foreign countries. During four years I <lb/>
flitted upon careless wing amid the beauteous gardens <lb/>
of the distant strand, if you will permit this form of <lb/>
speech in one whose tongue was ever attuned to poesy; <lb/>
and indeed I so speak with confidence, as one unto his <lb/>
<pb n="364"/>
kind, for I perceive by your eyes that you too, sir, are <lb/>
gifted with the divine inflation. In those far lands I <lb/>
reveled in the ambrosial food that fructifies the soul, <lb/>
the mind, the heart. But of all things, that which most <lb/>
appealed to my inborn &#x00E6;sthetic taste was the prevail- <lb/>
ing custom there, among the rich, of making collections <lb/>
of elegant and costly rarities, dainty <foreign lang="fre"><i>objets de vertu</i>,</foreign> <lb/>
and in an evil hour I tried to uplift my uncle Ithuriel <lb/>
to a plane of sympathy with this exquisite employment.</p>
<p>I wrote and told him of one gentlemen's vast collec- <lb/>
tion of shells; another's noble collection of meerschaum <lb/>
pipes; another's elevating and refining collection of <lb/>
undecipherable autographs; another's priceless collec- <lb/>
tion of old china; another's enchanting collection of <lb/>
postage stamps&#x2014;and so forth and so on. Soon my <lb/>
letters yielded fruit. My uncle began to look about for <lb/>
something to make a collection of. You may know, <lb/>
perhaps, how fleetly a taste like this dilates. His soon <lb/>
became a raging fever, though I knew it not. He <lb/>
began to neglect his great pork business; presently he <lb/>
wholly retired and turned an elegant leisure into a <lb/>
rabid search for curious things. His wealth was vast, <lb/>
and he spared it not. First he tried cow-bells. He <lb/>
made a collection which filled five large <i>salons</i>, and <lb/>
comprehended all the different sorts of cow-bells that <lb/>
ever had been contrived, save one. That one&#x2014;an <lb/>
antique, and the only specimen extant&#x2014;was possessed <lb/>
by another collector. My uncle offered enormous sums <lb/>
for it, but the gentleman would not sell. Doubtless <lb/>
you know what necessarily resulted. A true collector <lb/>
attaches no value to a collection that is not complete. <lb/>
His great heart breaks, he sells his hoard, he turns his <lb/>
mind to some field that seems unoccupied.</p>
<p>Thus did my uncle. He next tried brickbats. <lb/>
After piling up a vast and intensely interesting collec- <lb/>
tion, the former difficulty supervened; his great heart <lb/>
<pb n="365"/>
broke again; he sold out his soul's idol to the retired <lb/>
brewer who possessed the missing brick. Then he tried <lb/>
flint hatchets and other implements of Primeval Man, <lb/>
but by and by discovered that the factory where they <lb/>
were made was supplying other collectors as well as <lb/>
himself. He tried Aztec inscriptions and stuffed whales <lb/>
&#x2014;another failure, after incredible labor and expense. <lb/>
When his collection seemed at last perfect, a stuffed <lb/>
whale arrived from Greenland and an Aztec inscription <lb/>
from the Cundurango regions of Central America that <lb/>
made all former specimens insignificant. My uncle <lb/>
hastened to secure these noble gems. He got the <lb/>
stuffed whale, but another collector got the inscription. <lb/>
A real Cundurango, as possibly you know, is a posses- <lb/>
sion of such supreme value that, when once a collector <lb/>
gets it, he will rather part with his family than with it. <lb/>
So my uncle sold out, and saw his darlings go forth, <lb/>
never more to return; and his coal-black hair turned <lb/>
white as snow in a single night.</p>
<p>Now he waited, and thought. He knew another dis- <lb/>
appointment might kill him. He was resolved that he <lb/>
would choose things next time that no other man was <lb/>
collecting. He carefully made up his mind, and once <lb/>
more entered the field&#x2014;this time to make a collection <lb/>
of echoes.</p>
<p>"Of what?" said I.</p>
<p>Echoes, sir. His first purchase was an echo in <lb/>
Georgia that repeated four times; his next was a six- <lb/>
repeater in Maryland; his next was a thirteen-repeater <lb/>
in Maine; his next was a nine-repeater in Kansas; his <lb/>
next was a twelve-repeater in Tennessee, which he got <lb/>
cheap, so to speak, because it was out of repair, a por- <lb/>
tion of the crag which reflected it having tumbled down. <lb/>
He believed he could repair it at a cost of a few thou- <lb/>
sand dollars, and, by increasing the elevation with <lb/>
masonry, treble the repeating capacity; but the archi- <lb/>
<pb n="366"/>
tect who undertook the job had never built an echo be- <lb/>
fore, and so he utterly spoiled this one. Before he <lb/>
meddled with it, it used to talk back like a mother-in- <lb/>
law, but now it was only fit for the deaf and dumb <lb/>
asylum. Well, next he bought a lot of cheap little <lb/>
double-barreled echoes, scattered around over various <lb/>
States and Territories; he got them at twenty per cent. <lb/>
off by taking the lot. Next he bought a perfect Gat- <lb/>
ling-gun of an echo in Oregon, and it cost a fortune, I <lb/>
can tell you. You may know, sir, that in the echo <lb/>
market the scale of prices is cumulative, like the carat- <lb/>
scale in diamonds; in fact, the same phraseology is <lb/>
used. A single-carat echo is worth but ten dollars over <lb/>
and above the value of the land it is on; a two-carat <lb/>
or double-barreled echo is worth thirty dollars; a five- <lb/>
carat is worth nine hundred and fifty; a ten-carat is <lb/>
worth thirteen thousand. My uncle's Oregon echo, <lb/>
which he called the Great Pitt Echo, was a twenty-two <lb/>
carat gem, and cost two hundred and sixteen thousand <lb/>
dollars&#x2014;they threw the land in, for it was four <lb/>
hundred miles from a settlement.</p>
<p>Well, in the meantime my path was a path of roses. <lb/>
I was the accepted suitor of the only and lovely daughter <lb/>
of an English earl, and was beloved to distraction. In <lb/>
that dear presence I swam in seas of bliss. The family <lb/>
were content, for it was known that I was sole heir to <lb/>
an uncle held to be worth five millions of dollars. <lb/>
However, none of us knew that my uncle had become <lb/>
a collector, at least in anything more than a small way, <lb/>
for &#x00E6;sthetic amusement.</p>
<p>Now gathered the clouds above my unconscious head. <lb/>
That divine echo, since known throughout the world <lb/>
as the Great Koh-i-noor, or Mountain of Repetitions, <lb/>
was discovered. It was a sixty-five-carat gem. You <lb/>
could utter a word and it would talk back at you for <lb/>
fifteen minutes, when the day was otherwise quiet. <lb/>
<pb n="367"/>
But behold, another fact came to light at the same <lb/>
time: another echo collector was in the field. The two <lb/>
rushed to make the peerless purchase. The property <lb/>
consisted of a couple of small hills with a shallow swale <lb/>
between, out yonder among the back settlements of <lb/>
New York State. Both men arrived on the ground at <lb/>
the same time, and neither knew the other was there. <lb/>
The echo was not all owned by one man; a person <lb/>
by the name of Williamson Bolivar Jarvis owned the <lb/>
east hill, and a person by the name of Harbison J. <lb/>
Bledso owned the west hill; the swale between was the <lb/>
dividing line. So while my uncle was buying Jarvis's <lb/>
hill for three million two hundred and eighty-five thou- <lb/>
sand dollars, the other party was buying Bledso's hill <lb/>
for a shade over three million.</p>
<p>Now, do you perceive the natural result? Why, the <lb/>
noblest collection of echoes on earth was forever and <lb/>
ever incomplete, since it possessed but the one-half of <lb/>
the king echo of the universe. Neither man was con- <lb/>
tent with this divided ownership, yet neither would sell <lb/>
to the other. There were jawings, bickerings, heart- <lb/>
burnings. And at last that other collector, with a <lb/>
malignity which only a collector can ever feel toward a <lb/>
man and a brother, proceeded to cut down his hill!</p>
<p>You see, as long as he could not have the echo, he <lb/>
was resolved that nobody should have it. He would <lb/>
remove his hill, and then there would be nothing to re- <lb/>
flect my uncle's echo. My uncle remonstrated with <lb/>
him, but the man said, "I own one end of this echo; I <lb/>
choose to kill my end; you must take care of your <lb/>
own end yourself."</p>
<p>Well, my uncle got an injunction put on him. The <lb/>
other man appealed and fought it in a higher court. <lb/>
They carried it on up, clear to the Supreme Court of <lb/>
the United States. It made no end of trouble there. <lb/>
Two of the judges believed that an echo was personal <lb/>
<pb n="368"/>
property, because it was impalpable to sight and touch, <lb/>
and yet was purchaseable, salable, and consequently <lb/>
taxable; two others believed that an echo was real <lb/>
estate, because it was manifestly attached to the land, <lb/>
and was not removable from place to place; other of <lb/>
the judges contended that an echo was not property at <lb/>
all.</p>
<p>It was finally decided that the echo was property; <lb/>
that the hills were property; that the two men were <lb/>
separate and independent owners of the two hills, but <lb/>
tenants in common in the echo; therefore defendant <lb/>
was at full liberty to cut down his hill, since it belonged <lb/>
solely to him, but must give bonds in three million dol- <lb/>
lars as indemnity for damages which might result to my <lb/>
uncle's half of the echo. This decision also debarred <lb/>
my uncle from using defendant's hill to reflect his part <lb/>
of the echo, without defendant's consent; he must use <lb/>
only his own hill; if his part of the echo would not go, <lb/>
under these circumstances, it was sad, of course, but <lb/>
the court could find no remedy. The court also de- <lb/>
barred defendant from using my uncle's hill to reflect <lb/>
<i>his</i> end of the echo, without consent. You see the <lb/>
grand result! Neither man would give consent, and so <lb/>
that astonishing and most noble echo had to cease from <lb/>
its great powers; and since that day that magnificent <lb/>
property is tied up and unsalable.</p>
<p>A week before my wedding day, while I was still <lb/>
swimming in bliss and the nobility were gathering from <lb/>
far and near to honor our espousals, came news of my <lb/>
uncle's death, and also a copy of his will, making me <lb/>
his sole heir. He was gone; alas, my dear benefactor <lb/>
was no more. The thought surcharges my heart even <lb/>
at this remote day. I handed the will to the earl; I <lb/>
could not read it for the blinding tears. The earl read <lb/>
it; then he sternly said, "Sir, do you call this wealth? <lb/>
&#x2014;but doubtless you do in your inflated country. Sir, <lb/>
<pb n="369"/>
you are left sole heir to a vast collection of echoes&#x2014;if <lb/>
a thing can be called a collection that is scattered far <lb/>
and wide over the huge length and breadth of the <lb/>
American continent; sir, this is not all; you are head <lb/>
and ears in debt; there is not an echo in the lot but <lb/>
has a mortgage on it; sir, I am not a hard man, but I <lb/>
must look to my child's interest; if you had but one <lb/>
echo which you could honestly call your own, if you <lb/>
had but one echo which was free from incumbrance, so <lb/>
that you could retire to it with my child, and by hum- <lb/>
ble, painstaking industry, cultivate and improve it, and <lb/>
thus wrest from it a maintenance, I would not say you <lb/>
nay; but I cannot marry my child to a beggar. Leave <lb/>
his side, my darling; go, sir, take your mortgage- <lb/>
ridden echoes and quit my sight forever."</p>
<p>My noble Celestine clung to me in tears, with loving <lb/>
arms, and swore she would willingly, nay gladly, <lb/>
marry me, though I had not an echo in the world. <lb/>
But it could not be. We were torn asunder, she to <lb/>
pine and die within the twelve month, I to toil life's <lb/>
long journey sad and alone, praying daily, hourly, for <lb/>
that release which shall join us together again in that <lb/>
dear realm where the wicked cease from troubling and <lb/>
the weary are at rest. Now, sir, if you will be so kind <lb/>
as to look at these maps and plans in my portfolio, I <lb/>
am sure I can sell you an echo for less money than any <lb/>
man in the trade. Now this one, which cost my uncle <lb/>
ten dollars, thirty years ago, and is one of the sweetest <lb/>
things in Texas, I will let you have for&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Let me interrupt you," I said. "My friend, I <lb/>
have not had a moment's respite from canvassers this <lb/>
day. I have bought a sewing-machine which I did not <lb/>
want; I have bought a map which is mistaken in all <lb/>
its details; I have bought a clock which will not go; I <lb/>
have bought a moth poison which the moths prefer to <lb/>
any other beverage; I have bought no end of useless <lb/>
<pb n="370"/>
inventions, and now I have had enough of this foolish- <lb/>
ness. I would not have one of your echoes if you were <lb/>
even to give it to me. I would not let it stay on the <lb/>
place. I always hate a man that tries to sell me <lb/>
echoes. You see this gun? Now take your collection <lb/>
and move on; let us not have bloodshed."</p>
<p>But he only smiled a sad, sweet smile, and got out <lb/>
some more diagrams. You know the result perfectly <lb/>
well, because you know that when you have once <lb/>
opened the door to a canvasser, the trouble is done and <lb/>
you have got to suffer defeat.</p>
<p>I compromised with this man at the end of an intoler- <lb/>
able hour. I bought two double-barreled echoes in <lb/>
good condition, and he threw in another, which he said <lb/>
was not salable because it only spoke German. He <lb/>
said, "She was a perfect polyglot once, but somehow <lb/>
her palate got down."</p>

<head><b>AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN INTERVIEWER</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> nervous, dapper, "peart" young man took the <lb/>
chair I offered him, and said he was connected <lb/>
with the <i>Daily Thunderstorm</i>, and added:</p>
<p>"Hoping it's no harm, I've come to interview you."</p>
<p>"Come to what?"</p>
<p>"<i>Interview</i> you."</p>
<p>"Ah! I see. Yes&#x2014;yes. Um! Yes&#x2014;yes."</p>
<p>I was not feeling bright that morning. Indeed, my <lb/>
powers seemed a bit under a cloud. However, I went <lb/>
to the bookcase, and when I had been looking six or <lb/>
seven minutes, I found I was obliged to refer to the <lb/>
young man. I said:</p>
<p>"How do you spell it?"</p>
<p>"Spell what?"</p>
<p>"Interview."</p>
<p>"Oh, my goodness! what do you want to spell it <lb/>
for?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to spell it; I want to see what it <lb/>
means."</p>
<p>"Well, this is astonishing, I must say. <i>I</i> can tell <lb/>
you what it means, if you&#x2014;if you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, all right! That will answer, and much obliged <lb/>
to you, too."</p>
<p>"In, <i>in</i>, ter, <i>ter, in</i>ter&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Then you spell it with an <i>I?</i>"</p>
<pb n="372"/>
<p>"Why, certainly!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that is what took me so long."</p>
<p>"Why, my <i>dear</i> sir, what did <i>you</i> propose to spell it <lb/>
with?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&#x2014;I&#x2014;hardly know. I had the Una- <lb/>
bridged, and I was ciphering around in the back end, <lb/>
hoping I might tree her among the pictures. But it's <lb/>
a very old edition."</p>
<p>"Why, my friend, they wouldn't have a <i>picture</i> of it <lb/>
in even the latest e&#x2014;My dear sir, I beg your pardon, <lb/>
I mean no harm in the world, but you do not look as <lb/>
&#x2014;as&#x2014;intelligent as I had expected you would. No <lb/>
harm&#x2014;I mean no harm at all."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't mention it! It has often been said, and <lb/>
by people who would not flatter and who could have no <lb/>
inducement to flatter, that I am quite remarkable in <lb/>
that way. Yes&#x2014;yes; they always speak of it with <lb/>
rapture."</p>
<p>"I can easily imagine it. But about this interview. <lb/>
You know it is the custom, now, to interview any man <lb/>
who has become notorious."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I had not heard of it before. It must be <lb/>
very interesting. What do you do it with?"</p>
<p>"Ah, well&#x2014;well&#x2014;well&#x2014;this is disheartening. It <lb/>
<i>ought</i> to be done with a club in some cases; but cus- <lb/>
tomarily it consists in the interviewer asking questions <lb/>
and the interviewed answering them. It is all the rage <lb/>
now. Will you let me ask you certain questions cal- <lb/>
culated to bring out the salient points of your public <lb/>
and private history?"</p>
<p>"Oh, with pleasure&#x2014;with pleasure. I have a very <lb/>
bad memory, but I hope you will not mind that. <lb/>
That is to say, it is an irregular memory&#x2014;singularly <lb/>

<p>"Thanks. Are you ready to begin?"</p>
<p>"Ready."</p>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>How old are you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Nineteen, in June.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Indeed. I would have taken you to be thirty-five <lb/>
or six. Where were you born?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>In Missouri.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>When did you begin to write?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>In 1836.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Why, how could that be, if you are only nineteen <lb/>
now?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>I don't know. It does seem curious, some- <lb/>
how.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>It does, indeed. Whom do you consider the <lb/>
most remarkable man you ever met?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Aaron Burr.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>But you never could have met Aaron Burr, if you <lb/>
are only nineteen years&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Now, if you know more about me than I do, what <lb/>
do you ask me for?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Well, it was only a suggestion; nothing more. <lb/>
How did you happen to meet Burr?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Well, I happened to be at his funeral one day, <lb/>
and he asked me to make less noise, and&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>But, good heavens! if you were at his funeral, he <lb/>
must have been dead, and if he was dead how could he <lb/>
care whether you made a noise or not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>I don't know. He was always a particular kind <lb/>
of a man that way.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Still, I don't understand it at all. You say he <lb/>
spoke to you, and that he was dead.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>I didn't say he was dead.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>But wasn't he dead?</p></sp>
<pb n="374"/>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Well, some said he was, some said he wasn't.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>What did you think?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Oh, it was none of my business! It wasn't any <lb/>
of my funeral.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Did you&#x2014; However, we can never get this mat- <lb/>
ter straight. Let me ask about something else. What <lb/>
was the date of your birth?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Monday, October 31, 1693.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>What! Impossible! That would make you a <lb/>
hundred and eighty years old. How do you account <lb/>
for that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>I don't account for it at all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>But you said at first you were only nineteen, and <lb/>
now you make yourself out to be one hundred and <lb/>
eighty. It is an awful discrepancy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Why, have you noticed that? (Shaking hands.) <lb/>
Many a time it has seemed to me like a discrepancy, <lb/>
but somehow I couldn't make up my mind. How <lb/>
quick you notice a thing!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Thank you for the compliment, as far as it goes. <lb/>
Had you, or have you, any brothers or sisters?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Eh! I&#x2014;I&#x2014;I think so&#x2014;yes&#x2014;but I don't re- <lb/>
member.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Well, that is the most extraordinary statement I <lb/>
ever heard!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Why, what makes you think that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>How could I think otherwise? Why, look here! <lb/>
Who is this a picture of on the wall? Isn't that a <lb/>
brother of yours?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Oh, yes, yes, yes! Now you remind me of it; <lb/>
that <i>was</i> a brother of mine. That's William&#x2014;<i>Bill</i> <lb/>
we called him. Poor old Bill!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Why? Is he dead, then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Ah! well, I suppose so. We never could tell. <lb/>
There was a great mystery about it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>That is sad, very sad. He disappeared, then?</p></sp>
<pb n="375"/>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Well, yes, in a sort of general way. We buried <lb/>
him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q.</i></speaker><p><i>Buried</i> him! <i>Buried</i> him, without knowing <lb/>
whether he was dead or not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Oh, no! Not that. He was dead enough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Well, I confess that I can't understand this. If <lb/>
you buried him, and you knew he was dead&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>No! no! We only thought he was.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Oh, I see! He came to life again?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>I bet he didn't.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Well, I never heard anything like this. <i>Some- <lb/>
body</i> was dead. <i>Somebody</i> was buried. Now, where <lb/>
was the mystery?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Ah! that's just it! That's it exactly. You see, <lb/>
we were twins&#x2014;defunct and I&#x2014;and we got mixed in <lb/>
the bathtub when we were only two weeks old, and <lb/>
one of us was drowned. But we didn't know which. <lb/>
Some think it was Bill. Some think it was me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Well, that <i>is</i> remarkable. What do <i>you</i> think?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Goodness knows! I would give whole worlds to <lb/>
know. This solemn, this awful mystery has cast a <lb/>
gloom over my whole life. But I will tell you a secret <lb/>
now, which I never have revealed to any creature be- <lb/>
fore. One of us had a peculiar mark&#x2014;a large mole <lb/>
on the back of his left hand; that was <i>me. That child <lb/>
was the one that was drowned!</i></p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Very well, then, I don't see that there is any <lb/>
mystery about it, after all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>You don't? Well, <i>I</i> do. Anyway, I don't see <lb/>
how they could ever have been such a blundering lot <lb/>
as to go and bury the wrong child. But, 'sh!&#x2014;don't <lb/>
mention it where the family can hear of it. Heaven <lb/>
knows they have heart-breaking troubles enough with- <lb/>
out adding this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Q</i></speaker><p>Well, I believe I have got material enough for the <lb/>
present, and I am very much obliged to you for the <lb/>
<pb n="376"/>
pains you have taken. But I was a good deal interested <lb/>
in that account of Aaron Burr's funeral. Would you <lb/>
mind telling me what particular circumstance it was that <lb/>
made you think Burr was such a remarkable man?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i></speaker><p>Oh! it was a mere trifle! Not one man in fifty <lb/>
would have noticed it at all. When the sermon was <lb/>
over, and the procession all ready to start for the <lb/>
cemetery, and the body all arranged nice in the hearse, <lb/>
he said he wanted to take a last look at the scenery, <lb/>
and so he <i>got up and rode with the driver</i>.</p>
<p>Then the young man reverently withdrew. He was <lb/>
very pleasant company, and I was sorry to see him go.</p></sp>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> Parisian travels but little, he knows no language <lb/>
but his own, reads no literature but his own, and <lb/>
consequently he is pretty narrow and pretty self-suffi- <lb/>
cient. However, let us not be too sweeping; there are <lb/>
Frenchmen who know languages not their own: these <lb/>
are the waiters. Among the rest, they know English; <lb/>
that is, they know it on the European plan&#x2014;which is <lb/>
to say, they can speak it, but can't understand it. They <lb/>
easily make themselves understood, but it is next to im- <lb/>
possible to word an English sentence in such a way as <lb/>
to enable them to comprehend it. They think they <lb/>
comprehend it; they pretend they do; but they don't. <lb/>
Here is a conversation which I had with one of these <lb/>
beings; I wrote it down at the time, in order to have it <lb/>
exactly correct.</p>
<sp><speaker><i>I</i>.</speaker><p>These are fine oranges. Where are they grown?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>He</i>.</speaker><p>More? Yes, I will bring them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>I</i>.</speaker><p>No, do not bring any more; I only want to know <lb/>
where they are from&#x2014;where they are raised.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>He</i>.</speaker><p>Yes? (with imperturbable mien, and rising inflec- <lb/>
tion.)</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>I</i>.</speaker><p>Yes. Can you tell me what country they are from?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>He</i>.</speaker><p>Yes? (blandly, with rising inflection.)</p></sp>
<pb n="378"/>
<sp><speaker><i>I</i></speaker><p>(disheartened). They are very nice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>He</i>.</speaker><p>Good night. (Bows, and retires, quite satisfied <lb/>
with himself.)</p></sp>
<p>That young man could have become a good English <lb/>
scholar by taking the right sort of pains, but he was <lb/>
French, and wouldn't do that. How different is the <lb/>
case with our people; they utilize every means that <lb/>
offers. There are some alleged French Protestants in <lb/>
Paris, and they built a nice little church on one of the <lb/>
great avenues that lead away from the Arch of Triumph, <lb/>
and proposed to listen to the correct thing, preached in <lb/>
the correct way, there, in their precious French tongue, <lb/>
and be happy. But their little game does not succeed. <lb/>
Our people are always there ahead of them Sundays, <lb/>
and take up all the room. When the minister gets up <lb/>
to preach, he finds his house full of devout foreigners, <lb/>
each ready and waiting, with his little book in his hand <lb/>
&#x2014;a morocco-bound Testament, apparently. But only <lb/>
apparently; it is Mr. Bellows's admirable and exhaust- <lb/>
ive little French-English dictionary, which in look and <lb/>
binding and size is just like a Testament&#x2014;and those <lb/>
people are there to study French. The building has <lb/>
been nicknamed "The Church of the Gratis French <lb/>
Lesson."</p>
<p>These students probably acquire more language than <lb/>
general information, for I am told that a French ser- <lb/>
mon is like a French speech&#x2014;it never names a his- <lb/>
torical event, but only the date of it; if you are not up <lb/>
in dates, you get left. A French speech is something <lb/>
like this: <lb/>
<q>Comrades, citizens, brothers, noble parts of the only sublime and perfect <lb/>
nation, let us not forget that the 21st January cast off our chains; that the <lb/>
10th August relieved us of the shameful presence of foreign spies; that the <lb/>
5th September was its own justification before heaven and humanity; that <lb/>
the 18th Brumaire contained the seeds of its own punishment; that the <lb/>
14th July was the mighty voice of liberty proclaiming the resurrection, the <lb/>
<pb n="379"/>
new day, and inviting the oppressed peoples of the earth to look upon the <lb/>
divine face of France and live; and let us here record our everlasting curse <lb/>
against the man of the 2d December, and declare in thunder tones, the <lb/>
native tones of France, that but for him there had been no 17th March in <lb/>
history, no 12th October, no 19th January, no 22d April, no 16th Novem- <lb/>
ber, no 30th September, no 2d July, no 14th February, no 29th June, no <lb/>
15th August, no 31st May&#x2014;that but for him, France the pure, the grand, <lb/>
the peerless, had had a serene and vacant almanac to-day!</q></p>
<p>I have heard of one French sermon which closed in <lb/>
this odd yet eloquent way: <lb/>
<q>My hearers, we have sad cause to remember the man of the 13th Jan- <lb/>
uary. The results of the vast crime of the 13th January have been in just <lb/>
proportion to the magnitude of the act itself. But for it there had been no <lb/>
30th November&#x2014;sorrowful spectacle! The grisly deed of the 16th June <lb/>
had not been done but for it, nor had the man of the 16th June known <lb/>
existence; to it alone the 3d September was due, also the fatal 12th Octo- <lb/>
ber. Shall we, then, be grateful for the 13th January, with its freight of <lb/>
death for you and me and all that breathe? Yes, my friends, for it gave <lb/>
us also that which had never come but for it, and it alone&#x2014;the blessed <lb/>
25th December.</q></p>
<p>It may be well enough to explain, though in the case <lb/>
of many of my readers this will hardly be necessary. <lb/>
The man of the 13th January is Adam; the crime of <lb/>
that date was the eating of the apple; the sorrowful <lb/>
spectacle of the 30th November was the expulsion from <lb/>
Eden; the grisly deed of the 16th June was the murder <lb/>
of Abel; the act of the 3d September was the begin- <lb/>
ning of the journey to the land of Nod; the 12th day <lb/>
of October, the last mountain-tops disappeared under <lb/>
the flood. When you go to church in France, you <lb/>
want to take your almanac with you&#x2014;annotated.</p>

<head><b>I.</b></head>
<p><smcap>More</smcap> than a thousand years ago this small district <lb/>
was a kingdom&#x2014;a little bit of a kingdom, a <lb/>
sort of dainty little toy kingdom, as one might say. It <lb/>
was far removed from the jealousies, strifes, and tur- <lb/>
moils of that old warlike day, and so its life was a <lb/>
simple life, its people a gentle and guileless race; it <lb/>
lay always in a deep dream of peace, a soft Sabbath <lb/>
tranquillity; there was no malice, there was no envy, <lb/>
there was no ambition, consequently there were no <lb/>
heart-burnings, there was no unhappiness in the land.</p>
<p>In the course of time the old king died and his little <lb/>
son Hubert came to the throne. The people's love for <lb/>
him grew daily; he was so good and so pure and so <lb/>
noble, that by and by this love became a passion, almost <lb/>
a worship. Now at his birth the soothsayers had dili- <lb/>
gently studied the stars and found something written in <lb/>
that shining book to this effect:</p>
<p><i>In Hubert's fourteenth year a pregnant event will <lb/>
happen; the animal whose singing shall sound sweetest <lb/>
in Hubert's ear shall save Hubert's life. So long as the</i> <lb/>
<pb n="381"/>
<i>king and the nation shall honor this animal's race for <lb/>
this good deed, the ancient dynasty shall not fail of an <lb/>
heir, nor the nation know war or pestilence or poverty. <lb/>
But beware an erring choice!</i></p>
<p>All through the king's thirteenth year but one thing <lb/>
was talked of by the soothsayers, the statesmen, the <lb/>
little parliament, and the general people. That one <lb/>
thing was this: How is the last sentence of the <lb/>
prophecy to be understood? What goes before seems <lb/>
to mean that the saving animal will choose <i>itself</i>, at the <lb/>
proper time; but the closing sentence seems to mean <lb/>
that the <i>king</i> must choose beforehand, and say what <lb/>
singer among the animals pleases him best, and that if <lb/>
he choose wisely the chosen animal will save his life, <lb/>
his dynasty, his people, but that if he should make <lb/>
"an erring choice"&#x2014;beware!</p>
<p>By the end of the year there were as many opinions <lb/>
about this matter as there had been in the beginning; <lb/>
but a majority of the wise and the simple were agreed <lb/>
that the safest plan would be for the little king to make <lb/>
choice beforehand, and the earlier the better. So an <lb/>
edict was sent forth commanding all persons who <lb/>
owned singing creatures to bring them to the great hall <lb/>
of the palace in the morning of the first day of the new <lb/>
year. This command was obeyed. When everything <lb/>
was in readiness for the trial, the king made his solemn <lb/>
entry with the great officers of the crown, all clothed <lb/>
in their robes of state. The king mounted his golden <lb/>
throne and prepared to give judgment. But he <lb/>
presently said:</p>
<p>"These creatures all sing at once; the noise is unen- <lb/>
durable; no one can choose in such a turmoil. Take <lb/>
them all away, and bring back one at a time."</p>
<p>This was done. One sweet warbler after another <lb/>
charmed the young king's ear and was removed to <lb/>
<pb n="382"/>
make way for another candidate. The precious min- <lb/>
utes slipped by; among so many bewitching songsters <lb/>
he found it hard to choose, and all the harder because <lb/>
the promised penalty for an error was so terrible that it <lb/>
unsettled his judgment and made him afraid to trust <lb/>
his own cars. He grew nervous and his face showed <lb/>
distress. His ministers saw this, for they never took <lb/>
their eyes from him a moment. Now they began to <lb/>
say in their hearts:</p>
<p>"He has lost courage&#x2014;the cool head is gone&#x2014;he <lb/>
will err&#x2014;he and his dynasty and his people are <lb/>
doomed!"</p>
<p>At the end of an hour the king sat silent awhile, and <lb/>
then said:</p>
<p>"Bring back the linnet."</p>
<p>The linnet trilled forth her jubilant music. In the <lb/>
midst of it the king was about to uplift his scepter in <lb/>
sign of choice, but checked himself and said:</p>
<p>"But let us be sure. Bring back the thrush; let <lb/>
them sing together."</p>
<p>The thrush was brought, and the two birds poured <lb/>
out their marvels of song together. The king wavered, <lb/>
then his inclination began to settle and strengthen&#x2014; <lb/>
one could see it in his countenance. Hope budded in <lb/>
the hearts of the old ministers, their pulses began to <lb/>
beat quicker, the scepter began to rise slowly, when:</p>
<p>There was a hideous interruption! It was a sound <lb/>
like this&#x2014;just at the door:</p>
<p>"Waw&#x2026;&#x2026;<i>he!</i>&#x2014;waw&#x2026;&#x2026;<i>he!</i>&#x2014;waw-he! <lb/>
waw-he!&#x2014;waw-he!"</p>
<p>Everybody was sorely startled&#x2014;and enraged at him- <lb/>
self for showing it.</p>
<p>The next instant the dearest, sweetest, prettiest little <lb/>
peasant maid of nine years came tripping in, her brown <lb/>
eyes glowing with childish eagerness; but when she <lb/>
saw that august company and those angry faces she <lb/>
<pb n="383"/>
stopped and hung her head and put her poor coarse <lb/>
apron to her eyes. Nobody gave her welcome, none <lb/>
pitied her. Presently she looked up timidly through <lb/>
her tears, and said:</p>
<p>"My lord the king, I pray you pardon me, for I <lb/>
meant no wrong. I have no father and no mother, <lb/>
but I have a goat and a donkey, and they are all in all <lb/>
to me. My goat gives me the sweetest milk, and when <lb/>
my dear good donkey brays it seems to me there is no <lb/>
music like to it. So when my lord the king's jester <lb/>
said the sweetest singer among all the animals should <lb/>
save the crown and nation, and moved me to bring him <lb/>
here&#x2014;"</p>
<p>All the court burst into a rude laugh, and the child <lb/>
fled away crying, without trying to finish her speech. <lb/>
The chief minister gave a private order that she and <lb/>
her disastrous donkey be flogged beyond the precincts <lb/>
of the palace and commanded to come within them no <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>Then the trial of the birds was resumed. The two <lb/>
birds sang their best, but the scepter lay motionless in <lb/>
the king's hand. Hope died slowly out in the breasts <lb/>
of all. An hour went by; two hours; still no decision. <lb/>
The day waned to its close, and the waiting multitudes <lb/>
outside the palace grew crazed with anxiety and appre- <lb/>
hension. The twilight came on, the shadows fell deeper <lb/>
and deeper. The king and his court could no longer <lb/>
see each other's faces. No one spoke&#x2014;none called <lb/>
for lights. The great trial had been made; it had <lb/>
failed; each and all wished to hide their faces from the <lb/>
light and cover up their deep trouble in their own <lb/>
hearts.</p>
<p>Finally&#x2014;hark! A rich, full strain of the divinest <lb/>
melody streamed forth from a remote part of the hall&#x2014; <lb/>
the nightingale's voice!</p>
<p>"Up!" shouted the king, "let all the bells make <lb/>
<pb n="384"/>
proclamation to the people, for the choice is made and <lb/>
we have not erred. King, dynasty, and nation are <lb/>
saved. From henceforth let the nightingale be honored <lb/>
throughout the land forever. And publish it among <lb/>
all the people that whosoever shall insult a nightingale, <lb/>
or injure it, shall suffer death. The king hath spoken."</p>
<p>All that little world was drunk with joy. The castle <lb/>
and the city blazed with bonfires all night long, the <lb/>
people danced and drank and sang, and the triumphant <lb/>
clamor of the bells never ceased.</p>
<p>From that day the nightingale was a sacred bird. <lb/>
Its song was heard in every house; the poets wrote its <lb/>
praises; the painters painted it; its sculptured image <lb/>
adorned every arch and turret and fountain and public <lb/>
building. It was even taken into the king's councils; <lb/>
and no grave matter of state was decided until the <lb/>
soothsayers had laid the thing before the state nightin- <lb/>
gale and translated to the ministry what it was that the <lb/>
bird had sung about it.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II">
<head><b>II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> young king was very fond of the chase. When <lb/>
the summer was come he rode forth with hawk and <lb/>
hound, one day, in a brilliant company of his nobles. <lb/>
He got separated from them by and by, in a great <lb/>
forest, and took what he imagined a near cut, to find <lb/>
them again; but it was a mistake. He rode on and <lb/>
on, hopefully at first, but with sinking courage finally. <lb/>
Twilight came on, and still he was plunging through a <lb/>
lonely and unknown land. Then came a catastrophe. <lb/>
In the dim light he forced his horse through a tangled <lb/>
thicket overhanging a steep and rocky declivity. When <lb/>
horse and rider reached the bottom, the former had a <lb/>
<pb n="385"/>
broken neck and the latter a broken leg. The poor <lb/>
little king lay there suffering agonies of pain, and each <lb/>
hour seemed a long month to him. He kept his ear <lb/>
strained to hear any sound that might promise hope of <lb/>
rescue; but he heard no voice, no sound or horn or <lb/>
bay of hound. So at last he gave up all hope, and <lb/>
said, "Let death come, for come it must."</p>
<p>Just then the deep, sweet song of a nightingale swept <lb/>
across the still wastes of the night.</p>
<p>"Saved!" the king said. "Saved! It is the sacred <lb/>
bird, and the prophecy is come true. The gods them- <lb/>
selves protected me from error in the choice."</p>
<p>He could hardly contain his joy; he could not word <lb/>
his gratitude. Every few moments now he thought he <lb/>
caught the sound of approaching succor. But each <lb/>
time it was a disappointment; no succor came. The <lb/>
dull hours drifted on. Still no help came&#x2014;but still <lb/>
the sacred bird sang on. He began to have misgivings <lb/>
about his choice, but he stifled them. Toward dawn <lb/>
the bird ceased. The morning came, and with it thirst <lb/>
and hunger; but no succor. The day waxed and <lb/>
waned. At last the king cursed the nightingale.</p>
<p>Immediately the song of the thrush came from out <lb/>
the wood. The king said in his heart, "This was the <lb/>
true bird&#x2014;my choice was false&#x2014;succor will come <lb/>
now."</p>
<p>But it did not come. Then he lay many hours in- <lb/>
sensible. When he came to himself, a linnet was sing- <lb/>
ing. He listened&#x2014;with apathy. His faith was gone. <lb/>
"These birds," he said, "can bring no help; I and <lb/>
my house and my people are doomed." He turned <lb/>
him about to die; for he was grown very feeble from <lb/>
hunger and thirst and suffering, and felt that his end <lb/>
was near. In truth, he wanted to die, and be released <lb/>
from pain. For long hours he lay without thought or <lb/>
feeling or motion. Then his senses returned. The <lb/>
<pb n="386"/>
dawn of the third morning was breaking. Ah, the <lb/>
world seemed very beautiful to those worn eyes. Sud- <lb/>
denly a great longing to live rose up in the lad's heart, <lb/>
and from his soul welled a deep and fervent prayer <lb/>
that Heaven would have mercy upon him and let him <lb/>
see his home and his friends once more. In that in- <lb/>
stant a soft, a faint, a far-off sound, but oh, how <lb/>
inexpressibly sweet to his waiting ear, came floating <lb/>
out of the distance:</p>
<p>"Waw&#x2026;&#x2026;<i>he!</i> waw&#x2026;&#x2026;<i>he!</i> waw-he!&#x2014;waw- <lb/>
he!&#x2014;waw-he!"</p>
<p>"<i>That</i>, oh, <i>that</i> song is sweeter, a thousand times <lb/>
sweeter than the voice of the nightingale, thrush, or <lb/>
linnet, for it brings not mere hope, but <i>certainty</i> of <lb/>
succor; and now, indeed, am I saved! The sacred <lb/>
singer has chosen itself, as the oracle intended; the <lb/>
prophecy is fulfilled, and my life, my house, and my <lb/>
people are redeemed. The ass shall be sacred from <lb/>
this day!"</p>
<p>The divine music grew nearer and nearer, stronger <lb/>
and stronger&#x2014;and ever sweeter and sweeter to the <lb/>
perishing sufferer's ear. Down the declivity the docile <lb/>
little donkey wandered, cropping herbage and singing <lb/>
as he went; and when at last he saw the dead horse <lb/>
and the wounded king, he came and snuffed at them <lb/>
with simple and marveling curiosity. The king petted <lb/>
him, and he knelt down as had been his wont when his <lb/>
little mistress desired to mount. With great labor and <lb/>
pain the lad drew himself upon the creature's back <lb/>
and held himself there by aid of the generous ears. <lb/>
The ass went singing forth from the place and carried <lb/>
the king to the little peasant maid's hut. She gave <lb/>
him her pallet for a bed, refreshed him with goat's milk, <lb/>
and then flew to tell the great news to the first scouting- <lb/>
party of searchers she might meet.</p>
<p>The king got well. His first act was to proclaim the <lb/>
<pb n="387"/>
sacredness and inviolability of the ass; his second was <lb/>
to add this particular ass to his cabinet and make him <lb/>
chief minister of the crown; his third was to have all <lb/>
the statues and effigies of nightingales throughout his <lb/>
kingdom destroyed, and replaced by statues and effigies <lb/>
of the sacred donkey; and his fourth was to announce <lb/>
that when the little peasant maid should reach her <lb/>
fifteenth year he would make her his queen&#x2014;and he <lb/>
kept his word.</p>
<p>Such is the legend. This explains why the moulder- <lb/>
ing image of the ass adorns all these old crumbling <lb/>
walls and arches; and it explains why, during many <lb/>
centuries, an ass was always the chief minister in that <lb/>
royal cabinet, just as is still the case in most cabinets <lb/>
to this day; and it also explains why, in that little <lb/>
kingdom, during many centuries, all great poems, all <lb/>
great speeches, all great books, all public solemnities, <lb/>
and all royal proclamations, always began with these <lb/>
stirring words:</p>
<p>"Waw&#x2026;&#x2026;<i>he</i>!&#x2014;waw&#x2026;&#x2026;<i>he</i>!&#x2014;waw-he!&#x2014; <lb/>
waw-he!&#x2014;waw-he!"</p>

<head><b>SPEECH ON THE BABIES</b></head>
<q><smcap>at the banquet, in chicago, given by the army of the <lb/>
tennessee to their first commander, general u. s. <lb/>
grant, november, 1879.</smcap></q>
<ornament type="line"/>
<q>[The fifteenth regular toast was "The Babies&#x2014;As they comfort us in <lb/>
our sorrows, let us not forget them in our festivities."]</q>
<p><smcap>I like</smcap> that. We have not all had the good fortune <lb/>
to be ladies. We have not all been generals, or poets, <lb/>
or statesmen; but when the toast works down to the <lb/>
babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame <lb/>
that for a thousand years the world's banquets have <lb/>
utterly ignored the baby, as if he didn't amount to <lb/>
anything. If you will stop and think a minute&#x2014;if <lb/>
you will go back fifty or one hundred years to your <lb/>
early married life and recontemplate your first baby&#x2014; <lb/>
you will remember that he amounted to a good deal, <lb/>
and even something over. You soldiers all know that <lb/>
when that little fellow arrived at family headquarters <lb/>
you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire <lb/>
command. You became his lackey, his mere body- <lb/>
servant, and you had to stand around, too. He was <lb/>
not a commander who made allowances for time, dis- <lb/>
tance, weather, or anything else. You had to execute <lb/>
his order whether it was possible or not. And there <lb/>
<pb n="389"/>
was only one form of marching in his manual of tac- <lb/>
tics, and that was the double-quick. He treated you <lb/>
with every sort of insolence and disrespect, and the <lb/>
bravest of you didn't dare to say a word. You could <lb/>
face the death-storm at Donelson and Vicksburg, and <lb/>
give back blow for blow; but when he clawed your <lb/>
whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted your nose, <lb/>
you had to take it. When the thunders of war were <lb/>
sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the <lb/>
batteries, and advanced with steady tread; but when <lb/>
he turned on the terrors of his warwhoop you ad- <lb/>
vanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the <lb/>
chance, too. When he called for soothing-syrup, did <lb/>
you venture to throw out any side remarks about <lb/>
certain services being unbecoming an officer and a <lb/>
gentleman? No. You got up and <i>got</i> it. When he <lb/>
ordered his pap bottle and it was not warm, did you <lb/>
talk back? Not you. You went to work and <i>warmed</i> <lb/>
it. You even descended so far in your menial office as <lb/>
to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to <lb/>
see if it was right&#x2014;three parts water to one of milk, a <lb/>
touch of sugar to modify the colic, and a drop of <lb/>
peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can <lb/>
taste that stuff yet. And how many things you learned <lb/>
as you went along! Sentimental young folks still take <lb/>
stock in that beautiful old saying that when the baby <lb/>
smiles in his sleep, it is because the angels are whisper- <lb/>
ing to him. Very pretty, but too thin&#x2014;simply wind <lb/>
on the stomach, my friends. If the baby proposed to <lb/>
take a walk at his usual hour, two o'clock in the morn- <lb/>
ing, didn't you rise up promptly and remark, with a <lb/>
mental addition which would not improve a Sunday- <lb/>
school book <i>much</i>, that that was the very thing you <lb/>
were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were under <lb/>
good discipline, and as you went fluttering up and <lb/>
down the room in your undress uniform, you not only <lb/>
<pb n="390"/>
prattled undignified baby-talk, but even tuned up your <lb/>
martial voices and tried to <i>sing!</i>&#x2014;"Rock-a-by baby <lb/>
in the tree-top," for instance. What a spectacle for <lb/>
an Army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction <lb/>
for the neighbors, too; for it is not everybody within a <lb/>
mile around that likes military music at three in the <lb/>
morning. And when you had been keeping this sort <lb/>
of thing up two or three hours, and your little velvet- <lb/>
head intimated that nothing suited him like exercise <lb/>
and noise, what did you do? ["<i>Go on</i>!"] You <lb/>
simply <i>went</i> on until you dropped in the last ditch. <lb/>
The idea that a <i>baby</i> doesn't <i>amount</i> to anything! <lb/>
Why, <i>one</i> baby is just a house and a front yard full by <lb/>
itself. <i>One</i> baby can furnish more business than you <lb/>
and your whole Interior Department can attend to. <lb/>
He is enterprising, irrepressible, brimful of lawless <lb/>
activities. Do what you please, you can't make him <lb/>
stay on the reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one <lb/>
baby. As long as you are in your right mind don't you <lb/>
ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a permanent <lb/>
riot. And there ain't any real difference between <lb/>
triplets and an insurrection.</p>
<p>Yes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognize <lb/>
the importance of the babies. Think what is in store <lb/>
for the present crop! Fifty years from now we shall <lb/>
all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive <lb/>
(and let us hope it may), will be floating over a Re- <lb/>
public numbering 200,000,000 souls, according to the <lb/>
settled laws of our increase. Our present schooner of <lb/>
State will have grown into a political leviathan&#x2014;a <lb/>
Great Eastern. The cradled babies of to-day will be <lb/>
on deck. Let them be well trained, for we are going <lb/>
to leave a big contract on their hands. Among the <lb/>
three or four million cradles now rocking in the land <lb/>
are some which this nation would preserve for ages as <lb/>
sacred things, if we could know which ones they are. <lb/>
<pb n="391"/>
In one of these cradles the unconscious Farragut of <lb/>
the future is at this moment teething&#x2014;think of it!&#x2014; <lb/>
and putting in a world of dead earnest, unarticulated, <lb/>
but perfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In <lb/>
another the future renowned astronomer is blinking at <lb/>
the shining Milky Way with but a languid interest&#x2014; <lb/>
poor little chap!&#x2014;and wondering what has become of <lb/>
that other one they call the wet-nurse. In another the <lb/>
future great historian is lying&#x2014;and doubtless will <lb/>
continue to lie until his earthly mission is ended. In <lb/>
another the future President is busying himself with no <lb/>
profounder problem of state than what the mischief has <lb/>
become of his hair so early; and in a mighty array of <lb/>
other cradles there are now some 60,000 future office- <lb/>
seekers, getting ready to furnish him occasion to grap- <lb/>
ple with that same old problem a second time. And <lb/>
in still one more cradle, somewhere under the flag, the <lb/>
future illustrious commander-in-chief of the American <lb/>
armies is so little burdened with his approaching <lb/>
grandeurs and responsibilities as to be giving his whole <lb/>
strategic mind at this moment to trying to find out <lb/>
some way to get his big toe into his mouth&#x2014;an <lb/>
achievement which, meaning no disrespect, the illus- <lb/>
trious guest of this evening turned <i>his</i> entire attention <lb/>
to some fifty-six years ago; and if the child is but a <lb/>
prophecy of the man, there are mighty few who will <lb/>
doubt that he <i>succeeded</i>.</p>

<q>The next toast was: "The Oldest Inhabitant&#x2014;The Weather of New <lb/>
England." <lb/>
<lg>
<l>Who can lose it and forget it?</l>
<l>Who can have it and regret it?</l>

</cit>
</epigraph>
<q>To this Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain) replied as follows:&#x2014;</q>
<p><smcap>I reverently</smcap> believe that the Maker who made <lb/>
us all makes everything in New England but the <lb/>
weather. I don't know who makes that, but I think it <lb/>
must be raw apprentices in the weather-clerk's factory <lb/>
who experiment and learn how, in New England, for <lb/>
board and clothes, and then are promoted to make <lb/>
weather for countries that require a good article, and <lb/>
will take their custom elsewhere if they don't get it. <lb/>
There is a sumptuous variety about the New England <lb/>
weather that compels the stranger's admiration&#x2014;and <lb/>
regret. The weather is always doing something there; <lb/>
always attending strictly to business; always getting <lb/>
up new designs and trying them on the people to see <lb/>
how they will go. But it gets through more business <lb/>
<pb n="393"/>
in spring than in any other season. In the spring I <lb/>
have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds <lb/>
of weather inside of four-and-twenty hours. It was I <lb/>
that made the fame and fortune of that man that had <lb/>
that marvelous collection of weather on exhibition at <lb/>
the Centennial, that so astounded the foreigners. He <lb/>
was going to travel all over the world and get speci- <lb/>
mens from all the climes. I said, "Don't you do it; <lb/>
you come to New England on a favorable spring day." <lb/>
I told him what we could do in the way of style, <lb/>
variety, and quantity. Well, he came and he made <lb/>
his collection in four days. As to variety, why, he con- <lb/>
fessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather that he <lb/>
had never heard of before. And as to quantity&#x2014; <lb/>
well, after he had picked out and discarded all that <lb/>
was blemished in any way, he not only had weather <lb/>
enough, but weather to spare; weather to hire out; <lb/>
weather to sell; to deposit; weather to invest; weather <lb/>
to give to the poor. The people of New England are <lb/>
by nature patient and forbearing, but there are some <lb/>
things which they will not stand. Every year they kill <lb/>
a lot of poets for writing about "Beautiful Spring." <lb/>
These are generally casual visitors, who bring their <lb/>
notions of spring from somewhere else, and cannot, of <lb/>
course, know how the natives feel about spring. And <lb/>
so the first thing they know the opportunity to inquire <lb/>
how they feel has permanently gone by. Old Proba- <lb/>
bilities has a mighty reputation for accurate prophecy, <lb/>
and thoroughly well deserves it. You take up the <lb/>
paper and observe how crisply and confidently he <lb/>
checks off what to-day's weather is going to be on the <lb/>
Pacific, down South, in the Middle States, in the Wis- <lb/>
consin region. See him sail along in the joy and pride <lb/>
of his power till he gets to New England, and then see <lb/>
his tail drop. <i>He</i> doesn't know what the weather is <lb/>
going to be in New England. Well, he mulls over it, <lb/>
<pb n="394"/>
and by and by he gets out something about like this: <lb/>
Probable northeast to southwest winds, varying to the <lb/>
southward and westward and eastward, and points be- <lb/>
tween, high and low barometer swapping around from <lb/>
place to place; probable areas of rain, snow, hail, and <lb/>
drought, succeeded or preceded by earthquakes, with <lb/>
thunder and lightning. Then he jots down this post- <lb/>
script from his wandering mind, to cover accidents: <lb/>
"But it is possible that the programme may be wholly <lb/>
changed in the mean time." Yes, one of the brightest <lb/>
gems in the New England weather is the dazzling un- <lb/>
certainty of it. There is only one thing certain about <lb/>
it: you are certain there is going to be plenty of it&#x2014; <lb/>
a perfect grand review; but you never can tell which <lb/>
end of the procession is going to move first. You fix <lb/>
up for the drought; you leave your umbrella in the <lb/>
house and sally out, and two to one you get drowned. <lb/>
You make up your mind that the earthquake is due; <lb/>
you stand from under, and take hold of something to <lb/>
steady yourself, and the first thing you know you get <lb/>
struck by lightning. These are great disappointments; <lb/>
but they can't be helped. The lightning there is pecu- <lb/>
liar; it is so convincing, that when it strikes a thing it <lb/>
doesn't leave enough of that thing behind for you to <lb/>
tell whether&#x2014; Well, you'd think it was something <lb/>
valuable, and a Congressman had been there. And the <lb/>
thunder. When the thunder begins to merely tune up <lb/>
and scrape and saw, and key up the instruments for the <lb/>
performance, strangers say, "Why, what awful thunder <lb/>
you have here!" But when the baton is raised and the <lb/>
real concert begins, you'll find that stranger down in <lb/>
the cellar with his head in the ash-barrel. Now as to <lb/>
the <i>size</i> of the weather in New England&#x2014;lengthways, <lb/>
I mean. It is utterly disproportioned to the size of <lb/>
that little country. Half the time, when it is packed <lb/>
as full as it can stick, you will see that New England <lb/>
<pb n="395"/>
weather sticking out beyond the edges and projecting <lb/>
around hundreds and hundreds of miles over the neigh- <lb/>
boring States. She can't hold a tenth part of her <lb/>
weather. You can see cracks all about where she has <lb/>
strained herself trying to do it. I could speak volumes <lb/>
about the inhuman perversity of the New England <lb/>
weather, but I will give but a single specimen. I like <lb/>
to hear rain on a tin roof. So I covered part of my <lb/>
roof with tin, with an eye to that luxury. Well, sir, <lb/>
do you think it ever rains on that tin? No, sir; skips <lb/>
it every time. Mind, in this speech I have been trying <lb/>
merely to do honor to the New England weather&#x2014;no <lb/>
language could do it justice. But, after all, there is at <lb/>
least one or two things about that weather (or, if you <lb/>
please, effects produced by it) which we residents <lb/>
would not like to part with. If we hadn't our bewitch- <lb/>
ing autumn foliage, we should still have to credit the <lb/>
weather with one feature which compensates for all its <lb/>
bullying vagaries&#x2014;the ice-storm: when a leafless tree <lb/>
is clothed with ice from the bottom to the top&#x2014;ice <lb/>
that is as bright and clear as crystal; when every bough <lb/>
and twig is strung with ice-beads, frozen dewdrops, <lb/>
and the whole tree sparkles cold and white, like the <lb/>
Shah of Persia's diamond plume. Then the wind <lb/>
waves the branches and the sun comes out and turns <lb/>
all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that <lb/>
glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored <lb/>
fires, which change and change again with inconceivable <lb/>
rapidity from blue to red, from red to green, and green <lb/>
to gold&#x2014;the tree becomes a spraying fountain, a very <lb/>
explosion of dazzling jewels; and it stands there the <lb/>
acme, the climax, the supremest possibility in art or <lb/>
nature, of bewildering, intoxicating, intolerable mag- <lb/>
nificence. One cannot make the words too strong.</p>

Abroad."&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>There</smcap> was an Englishman in our compartment, <lb/>
and he complimented me on&#x2014;on what? But <lb/>
you would never guess. He complimented me on my <lb/>
English. He said Americans in general did not speak <lb/>
the English language as correctly as I did. I said I <lb/>
was obliged to him for his compliment, since I knew he <lb/>
meant it for one, but that I was not fairly entitled to it, <lb/>
for I did not speak English at all&#x2014;I only spoke <lb/>
American.</p>
<p>He laughed, and said it was a distinction without a <lb/>
difference. I said no, the difference was not pro- <lb/>
digious, but still it was considerable. We fell into a <lb/>
friendly dispute over the matter. I put my case as <lb/>
well as I could, and said:</p>
<p>"The languages were identical several generations <lb/>
ago, but our changed conditions and the spread of our <lb/>
people far to the south and far to the west have made <lb/>
many alterations in our pronunciation, and have intro- <lb/>
duced new words among us and changed the meanings <lb/>
of many old ones. English people talk through their <lb/>
noses; we do not. We say <i>know</i>, English people say <lb/>
<i>n&#x00E4;o;</i> we say <i>cow</i>, the Briton says <i>k&#x00E4;ow;</i> we&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="397"/>
<p>"Oh, come! that is pure Yankee; everybody knows <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is pure Yankee; that is true. One cannot <lb/>
hear it in America outside of the little corner called New <lb/>
England, which is Yankee land. The English them- <lb/>
selves planted it there, two hundred and fifty years ago, <lb/>
and there it remains; it has never spread. But Eng- <lb/>
land talks through her nose yet; the Londoner and the <lb/>
backwoods New-Englander pronounce 'know' and <lb/>
'cow' alike, and then the Briton unconsciously <lb/>
satirizes himself by making fun of the Yankee's pro- <lb/>
nunciation."</p>
<p>We argued this point at some length; nobody won; <lb/>
but no matter, the fact remains&#x2014;Englishmen say <i>n&#x00E4;o</i> <lb/>
and <i>k&#x00E4;ow</i> for "know" and "cow," and that is what <lb/>
the rustic inhabitant of a very small section of America <lb/>
does.</p>
<p>"You conferred your <i>a</i> upon New England, too, and <lb/>
there it remains; it has not traveled out of the narrow <lb/>
limits of those six little States in all these two hundred <lb/>
and fifty years. All England uses it, New England's <lb/>
small population&#x2014;say four millions&#x2014;use it, but we <lb/>
have forty-five millions who do not use it. You say <lb/>
'glahs of wawtah,' so does New England; at least, <lb/>
New England says <i>glahs</i>. America at large flattens <lb/>
the <i>a</i>, and says 'glass of water.' These sounds are <lb/>
pleasanter than yours; you may think they are not <lb/>
right&#x2014;well, in English they are <i>not</i> right, but in <lb/>
'American' they are. You say <i>flahsk</i>, and <i>bahsket</i>, <lb/>
and <i>jackahss;</i> we say 'flask,' 'basket,' 'jackass'&#x2014; <lb/>
sounding the <i>a</i> as it is in 'tallow,' 'fallow,' and so on. <lb/>
Up to as late as 1847 Mr. Webster's Dictionary had <lb/>
the impudence to still pronounce 'basket' <i>bahsket</i>, <lb/>
when he knew that outside of his little New England all <lb/>
America shortened the <i>a</i> and paid no attention to his <lb/>
English broadening of it. However, it called itself an <lb/>
<pb n="398"/>
English Dictionary, so it was proper enough that it <lb/>
should stick to English forms, perhaps. It still calls <lb/>
itself an English Dictionary to-day, but it has quietly <lb/>
ceased to pronounce 'basket' as if it were spelt <lb/>
<i>bahsket</i>. In the American language the <i>h</i> is respected; <lb/>
the <i>h</i> is not dropped or added improperly."</p>
<p>"The same is the case in England&#x2014;I mean among <lb/>
the educated classes, of course."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is true; but a nation's language is a very <lb/>
large matter. It is not simply a manner of speech ob- <lb/>
taining among the educated handful; the manner <lb/>
obtaining among the vast uneducated multitude must <lb/>
be considered also. Your uneducated masses speak <lb/>
English, you will not deny that; our uneducated <lb/>
masses speak American&#x2014;it won't be fair for you to <lb/>
deny that, for you can see, yourself, that when your <lb/>
stable-boy says, 'It isn't the 'unting that 'urts the <lb/>
'orse, but the 'ammer, 'ammer, 'ammer on the 'ard <lb/>
'ighway,' and our stable-boy makes the same remark <lb/>
without suffocating a single <i>h</i>, these two people are <lb/>
manifestly talking two different languages. But if the <lb/>
signs are to be trusted, even your educated classes used <lb/>
to drop the <i>h</i>. They say <i>humble</i>, now, and <i>heroic</i>, and <lb/>
<i>historic</i>, etc., but I judge that they used to drop those <lb/>
<i>h</i>'s because your writers still keep up the fashion of <lb/>
putting <i>an</i> before those words, instead of <i>a</i>. This is <lb/>
what Mr. Darwin might call a 'rudimentary' sign that <lb/>
an <i>an</i> was justifiable once, and useful&#x2014;when your <lb/>
educated classes used to say '<i>umble</i>, and '<i>eroic</i>, and <lb/>
'<foreign lang="rom"><i>istorical</i></foreign>. Correct writers of the American language <lb/>
do not put <i>an</i> before those words."</p>
<p>The English gentleman had something to say upon <lb/>
this matter, but never mind what he said&#x2014;I'm not <lb/>
arguing his case. I have him at a disadvantage, now. <lb/>
I proceeded:</p>
<p>"In England you encourage an orator by exclaiming <lb/>
<pb n="399"/>
'H'yaah! h'yaah!' We pronounce it <foreign lang="dut"><i>heer</i></foreign> in some <lb/>
sections, 'h'<i>yer</i>' in others, and so on; but our whites <lb/>
do not say 'h'yaah', pronouncing the <i>a</i>'s like the <i>a</i> in <lb/>
<i>ah</i>. I have heard English ladies say 'don't you '&#x2014; <lb/>
making two separate and distinct words of it; your <lb/>
Mr. Burnand has satirized it. But we always say <lb/>
'dontchu.' This is much better. Your ladies say, <lb/>
'Oh, it's <i>o</i>ful nice!' Ours say, 'Oh, it's <i>aw</i>ful nice!' <lb/>
We say, '<i>Four</i> hundred,' you say '<i>For</i>'&#x2014;as in the <lb/>
word <i>or</i>. Your clergymen speak of 'the Lawd,' ours <lb/>
of 'the Lord,' yours speak of 'the gawds of the <lb/>
heathen,' ours of 'the gods of the heathen.' When <lb/>
you are exhausted, you say you are 'knocked up.' <lb/>
We don't. When you say you will do a thing <lb/>
'directly,' you mean 'immediately'; in the American <lb/>
language&#x2014;generally speaking&#x2014;the word signifies <lb/>
'after a little.' When you say 'clever,' you mean <lb/>
'capable'; with us the word used to mean 'accom- <lb/>
modating,' but I don't know what it means now. Your <lb/>
word 'stout' means 'fleshy'; our word 'stout' usually <lb/>
means 'strong.' Your words 'gentleman' and 'lady' <lb/>
have a very restricted meaning; with us they include <lb/>
the barmaid, butcher, burglar, harlot, and horse thief. <lb/>
You say, 'I haven't <i>got</i> any stockings on,' 'I haven't <lb/>
<i>got</i> any memory,' 'I haven't <i>got</i> any money in my <lb/>
purse'; we usually say, 'I haven't any stockings on,' <lb/>
'I haven't any memory,' 'I haven't any money in my <lb/>
purse.' You say 'out of window'; we always put in <lb/>
a <i>the</i>. If one asks 'How old is that man?' the Briton <lb/>
answers, 'He will be about forty;' in the American <lb/>
language, we should say, 'He <i>is</i> about forty.' How- <lb/>
ever, I won't tire you, sir; but if I wanted to, I could <lb/>
pile up differences here until I not only convinced you <lb/>
that English and American are separate languages, but <lb/>
that when I speak my native tongue in its utmost purity <lb/>
an Englishman can't understand me at all."</p>
<pb n="400"/>
<p>"I don't wish to flatter you, but it is about all I can <lb/>

<p>That was a very pretty compliment, and it put us on <lb/>
the pleasantest terms directly&#x2014;I use the word in the <lb/>
English sense.</p>
<p>[<i>Later</i>&#x2014;1882. &#x00C6;sthetes in many of our schools <lb/>

<head><b>ROGERS</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> man Rogers happened upon me and introduced <lb/>
himself at the town of<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, in the South of Eng- <lb/>
land, where I stayed awhile. His stepfather had mar- <lb/>
ried a distant relative of mine who was afterwards <lb/>
hanged, and so he seemed to think a blood relationship <lb/>
existed between us. He came in every day and sat <lb/>
down and talked. Of all the bland, serene human <lb/>
curiosities I ever saw, I think he was the chiefest. He <lb/>
desired to look at my new chimney-pot hat. I was <lb/>
very willing, for I thought he would notice the name of <lb/>
the great Oxford Street hatter in it, and respect me <lb/>
accordingly. But he turned it about with a sort of <lb/>
grave compassion, pointed out two or three blemishes, <lb/>
and said that I, being so recently arrived, could not be <lb/>
expected to know where to supply myself. Said he <lb/>
would send me the address of <i>his</i> hatter. Then he <lb/>
said, "Pardon me," and proceeded to cut a neat circle <lb/>
of red tissue paper; daintily notched the edges of it; <lb/>
took the mucilage and pasted it in my hat so as to <lb/>
cover the manufacturer's name. He said, "No one <lb/>
will know now where you got it. I will send you a <lb/>
hat-tip of my hatter, and you can paste it over this <lb/>
tissue circle." It was the calmest, coolest thing&#x2014;I <lb/>
never admired a man so much in my life. Mind, he <lb/>
did this while his own hat sat offensively near our noses, <lb/>
<pb n="402"/>
on the table&#x2014;an ancient extinguisher of the "slouch" <lb/>
pattern, limp and shapeless with age, discolored by <lb/>
vicissitudes of the weather, and banded by an equator <lb/>
of bear's grease that had stewed through.</p>
<p>Another time he examined my coat. I had no ter- <lb/>
rors, for over my tailor's door was the legend, "By <lb/>
Special Appointment Tailor to H. R. H. the Prince of <lb/>
Wales," etc. I did not know at the time that the most <lb/>
of the tailor shops had the same sign out, and that <lb/>
whereas it takes nine tailors to make an ordinary man, <lb/>
it takes a hundred and fifty to make a prince. He was <lb/>
full of compassion for my coat. Wrote down the <lb/>
address of his tailor for me. Did not tell me to men- <lb/>
tion my <i>nom de plume</i> and the tailor would put his best <lb/>
work on my garment, as complimentary people some- <lb/>
times do, but said his tailor would hardly trouble him- <lb/>
self for an unknown person (unknown person, when I <lb/>
thought I was so celebrated in England!&#x2014;that was the <lb/>
cruelest cut), but cautioned me to mention <i>his</i> name, <lb/>
and it would be all right. Thinking to be facetious, I <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"But he might sit up all night and injure his <lb/>
health."</p>
<p>"Well, <i>let</i> him," said Rogers; "I've done enough <lb/>
for him, for him to show some appreciation of it."</p>
<p>I might as well have tried to disconcert a mummy <lb/>
with my facetiousness. Said Rogers: "I get all my <lb/>
coats there&#x2014;they're the only coats fit to be seen in."</p>
<p>I made one more attempt. I said, "I wish you had <lb/>
brought one with you&#x2014;I would like to look at it."</p>
<p>"Bless your heart, haven't I got one on?&#x2014;<i>this</i> <lb/>
article is Morgan's make."</p>
<p>I examined it. The coat had been bought ready- <lb/>
made, of a Chatham Street Jew, without any question <lb/>
&#x2014;about 1848. It probably cost four dollars when it <lb/>
was new. It was ripped, it was frayed, it was napless <lb/>
<pb n="403"/>
and greasy. I could not resist showing him where it <lb/>
was ripped. It so affected him that I was almost sorry <lb/>
I had done it. First he seemed plunged into a bottom- <lb/>
less abyss of grief. Then he roused himself, made a <lb/>
feint with his hands as if waving off the pity of a nation, <lb/>
and said&#x2014;with what seemed to me a manufactured <lb/>
emotion&#x2014;"No matter; no matter; don't mind me; <lb/>
do not bother about it. I can get another."</p>
<p>When he was thoroughly restored, so that he could <lb/>
examine the rip and command his feelings, he said, ah, <lb/>
<i>now</i> he understood it&#x2014;his servant must have done it <lb/>
while dressing him that morning.</p>
<p>His servant! There was something awe-inspiring in <lb/>
effrontery like this.</p>
<p>Nearly every day he interested himself in some <lb/>
article of my clothing. One would hardly have ex- <lb/>
pected this sort of infatuation in a man who always <lb/>
wore the same suit, and it a suit that seemed coeval <lb/>
with the Conquest.</p>
<p>It was an unworthy ambition, perhaps, but I <i>did</i> wish <lb/>
I could make this man admire <i>something</i> about me or <lb/>
something I did&#x2014;you would have felt the same way. <lb/>
I saw my opportunity: I was about to return to Lon- <lb/>
don, and had "listed" my soiled linen for the wash. <lb/>
It made quite an imposing mountain in the corner of <lb/>
the room&#x2014;fifty-four pieces. I hoped he would fancy <lb/>
it was the accumulation of a single week. I took up <lb/>
the wash list, as if to see that it was all right, and then <lb/>
tossed it on the table, with pretended forgetfulness. <lb/>
Sure enough, he took it up and ran his eye along <lb/>
down to the grand total. Then he said, "You get off <lb/>
easy," and laid it down again.</p>
<p>His gloves were the saddest ruin, but he told me <lb/>
where I could get some like them. His shoes would <lb/>
hardly hold walnuts without leaking, but he liked to <lb/>
put his feet up on the mantel-piece and contemplate <lb/>
<pb n="404"/>
them. He wore a dim glass breastpin, which he called <lb/>
a "morphylitic diamond"&#x2014;whatever that may mean <lb/>
&#x2014;and said only two of them had ever been found&#x2014; <lb/>
the Emperor of China had the other one.</p>
<p>Afterward, in London, it was a pleasure to me to see <lb/>
this fantastic vagabond come marching into the lobby <lb/>
of the hotel in his grand-ducal way, for he always had <lb/>
some new imaginary grandeur to develop&#x2014;there was <lb/>
nothing stale about him but his clothes. If he ad- <lb/>
dressed me when strangers were about, he always raised <lb/>
his voice a little and called me "Sir Richard," or <lb/>
"General," or "Your Lordship"&#x2014;and when people <lb/>
began to stare and look deferential, he would fall to in- <lb/>
quiring in a casual way why I disappointed the Duke of <lb/>
Argyll the night before; and then remind me of our <lb/>
engagement at the Duke of Westminster's for the fol- <lb/>
lowing day. I think that for the time being these <lb/>
things were realities to him. He once came and invited <lb/>
me to go with him and spend the evening with the Earl <lb/>
of Warwick at his town house. I said I had received <lb/>
no formal invitation. He said that that was of no con- <lb/>
sequence, the Earl had no formalities for him or his <lb/>
friends. I asked if I could go just as I was. He said <lb/>
no, that would hardly do; evening dress was requisite <lb/>
at night in any gentleman's house. He said he would <lb/>
wait while I dressed, and then we would go to his <lb/>
apartments and I could take a bottle of champagne and <lb/>
a cigar while he dressed. I was very willing to see <lb/>
how this enterprise would turn out, so I dressed, and <lb/>
we started to his lodgings. He said if I didn't mind <lb/>
we would walk. So we tramped some four miles <lb/>
through the mud and fog, and finally found his <lb/>
"apartments"; they consisted of a single room over a <lb/>
barber's shop in a back street. Two chairs, a small <lb/>
table, an ancient valise, a wash-basin and pitcher (both <lb/>
on the floor in a corner), an unmade bed, a fragment <lb/>
<pb n="405"/>
of a looking-glass, and a flower-pot with a perishing <lb/>
little rose geranium in it, which he called a century <lb/>
plant, and said it had not bloomed now for upwards of <lb/>
two centuries&#x2014;given to him by the late Lord Palmer- <lb/>
ston&#x2014;(been offered a prodigious sum for it)&#x2014;these <lb/>
were the contents of the room. Also a brass candle- <lb/>
stick and a part of a candle. Rogers lit the candle, <lb/>
and told me to sit down and make myself at home. <lb/>
He said he hoped I was thirsty, because he would sur- <lb/>
prise my palate with an article of champagne that sel- <lb/>
dom got into a commoner's system; or would I prefer <lb/>
sherry, or port? Said he had port in bottles that were <lb/>
swathed in stratified cobwebs, every stratum represent- <lb/>
ing a generation. And as for his cigars&#x2014;well, I <lb/>
should judge of them myself. Then he put his head <lb/>
out at the door and called:</p>
<p>"Sackville!" No answer.</p>
<p>"Hi!&#x2014;Sackville!" No answer.</p>
<p>"Now what the devil can have become of that <lb/>
butler? I <i>never</i> allow a servant to&#x2014; Oh, confound <lb/>
that idiot, he's got the <i>keys</i>. Can't get into the other <lb/>
rooms without the keys."</p>
<p>(I was just wondering at his intrepidity in still keep- <lb/>
ing up the delusion of the champagne, and trying to <lb/>
imagine how he was going to get out of the difficulty.)</p>
<p>Now he stopped calling Sackville and began to <lb/>
call "Anglesy." But Anglesy didn't come. He <lb/>
said, "This is the <i>second</i> time that that equerry has <lb/>
been absent without leave. To-morrow I'll discharge <lb/>
him."</p>
<p>Now he began to whoop for "Thomas," but Thomas <lb/>
didn't answer. Then for "Theodore," but no Theo- <lb/>
dore replied.</p>
<p>"Well, I give it up," said Rogers. "The servants <lb/>
never expect me at this hour, and so they're all off on <lb/>
a lark. Might get along without the equerry and the <lb/>
<pb n="406"/>
page, but can't have any wine or cigars without the <lb/>
butler, and can't dress without my valet."</p>
<p>I offered to help him dress, but he would not hear of <lb/>
it; and besides, he said he would not feel comfortable <lb/>
unless dressed by a practiced hand. However, he <lb/>
finally concluded that he was such old friends with the <lb/>
Earl that it would not make any difference how he was <lb/>
dressed. So we took a cab, he gave the driver some <lb/>
directions, and we started. By and by we stopped be- <lb/>
fore a large house and got out. I never had seen this <lb/>
man with a collar on. He now stepped under a lamp <lb/>
and got a venerable paper collar out of his coat pocket, <lb/>
along with a hoary cravat, and put them on. He <lb/>
ascended the stoop, and entered. Presently he re- <lb/>
appeared, descended rapidly, and said:</p>
<p>"Come&#x2014;quick!"</p>
<p>We hurried away, and turned the corner.</p>
<p>"Now we're safe," he said, and took off his collar <lb/>
and cravat and returned them to his pocket.</p>
<p>"Made a mighty narrow escape," said he.</p>
<p>"How?" said I.</p>
<p>"B' George, the Countess was there!"</p>
<p>"Well, what of that?&#x2014;don't she know you?"</p>
<p>"Know me? Absolutely worships me. I just did <lb/>
happen to catch a glimpse of her before she saw me&#x2014; <lb/>
and out I shot. Haven't seen her for two months&#x2014; <lb/>
to rush in on her without any warning might have been <lb/>
fatal. She could <i>not</i> have stood it. I didn't know <i>she</i> <lb/>
was in town&#x2014;thought she was at the castle. Let me <lb/>
lean on you&#x2014;just a moment&#x2014;there; now I am <lb/>
better&#x2014;thank you; thank you ever so much. Lord <lb/>
bless me, what an escape!"</p>
<p>So I never got to call on the Earl after all. But I <lb/>
marked the house for future reference. It proved to <lb/>
be an ordinary family hotel, with about a thousand <lb/>
plebeians roosting in it.</p>
<pb n="407"/>
<p>In most things Rogers was by no means a fool. In <lb/>
some things it was plain enough that he was a fool, but <lb/>
he certainly did not know it. He was in the "deadest" <lb/>
earnest in these matters. He died at sea, last summer, <lb/>
as the "Earl of Ramsgate."</p>

<head><b>THE LOVES OF ALONZO FITZ CLARENCE <lb/>
AND ROSANNAH ETHELTON</b></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was well along in the forenoon of a bitter winter's <lb/>
day. The town of Eastport, in the State of Maine, <lb/>
lay buried under a deep snow that was newly fallen. <lb/>
The customary bustle in the streets was wanting. One <lb/>
could look long distances down them and see nothing <lb/>
but a dead-white emptiness, with silence to match. <lb/>
Of course I do not mean that you could <i>see</i> the silence <lb/>
&#x2014;no, you could only hear it. The sidewalks were <lb/>
merely long, deep ditches, with steep snow walls on <lb/>
either side. Here and there you might hear the faint, <lb/>
far scrape of a wooden shovel, and if you were quick <lb/>
enough you might catch a glimpse of a distant black <lb/>
figure stooping and disappearing in one of those ditches, <lb/>
and reappearing the next moment with a motion which <lb/>
you would know meant the heaving out of a shovelful <lb/>
of snow. But you needed to be quick, for that black <lb/>
figure would not linger, but would soon drop that <lb/>
shovel and scud for the house, thrashing itself with its <lb/>
arms to warm them. Yes, it was too venomously <lb/>
cold for snow shovelers or any body else to stay out <lb/>
long.</p>
<p>Presently the sky darkened; then the wind rose and <lb/>
began to blow in fitful, vigorous gusts, which sent <lb/>
clouds of powdery snow aloft, and straight ahead, and <lb/>
<pb n="409"/>
everywhere. Under the impulse of one of these gusts, <lb/>
great white drifts banked themselves like graves across <lb/>
the streets; a moment later, another gust shifted them <lb/>
around the other way, driving a fine spray of snow <lb/>
from their sharp crests, as the gale drives the spume <lb/>
flakes from wave-crests at sea; a third gust swept that <lb/>
place as clean as your hand, if it saw fit. This was <lb/>
fooling, this was play; but each and all of the gusts <lb/>
dumped some snow into the sidewalk ditches, for that <lb/>
was business.</p>
<p>Alonzo Fitz Clarence was sitting in his snug and <lb/>
elegant little parlor, in a lovely blue silk dressing-gown, <lb/>
with cuffs and facings of crimson satin, elaborately <lb/>
quilted. The remains of his breakfast were before him, <lb/>
and the dainty and costly little table service added a <lb/>
harmonious charm to the grace, beauty, and richness <lb/>
of the fixed appointments of the room. A cheery fire <lb/>
was blazing on the hearth.</p>
<p>A furious gust of wind shook the windows, and a <lb/>
great wave of snow washed against them with a drench- <lb/>
ing sound, so to speak. The handsome young bachelor <lb/>
murmured:</p>
<p>"That means, no going out to-day. Well, I am <lb/>
content. But what to do for company? Mother is <lb/>
well enough, Aunt Susan is well enough; but these, <lb/>
like the poor, I have with me always. On so grim a <lb/>
day as this, one needs a new interest, a fresh element, <lb/>
to whet the dull edge of captivity. That was very <lb/>
neatly said, but it doesn't mean anything. One doesn't <lb/>
<i>want</i> the edge of captivity sharpened up, you know, <lb/>
but just the reverse."</p>
<p>He glanced at his pretty French mantel-clock.</p>
<p>"That clock's wrong again. That clock hardly ever <lb/>
knows what time it is; and when it does know, it lies <lb/>
about it&#x2014;which amounts to the same thing. Alfred!"</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<pb n="410"/>
<p>"Alfred! &#x2026;&#x2026; Good servant, but as uncertain as <lb/>
the clock."</p>
<p>Alonzo touched an electric bell button in the wall. <lb/>
He waited a moment, then touched it again; waited a <lb/>
few moments more, and said:</p>
<p>"Battery out of order, no doubt. But now that I <lb/>
have started, I <i>will</i> find out what time it is." He <lb/>
stepped to a speaking-tube in the wall, blew its <lb/>
whistle, and called, "Mother!" and repeated it twice.</p>
<p>"Well, <i>that's</i> no use. Mother's battery is out of <lb/>
order, too. Can't raise anybody downstairs&#x2014;that is <lb/>
plain."</p>
<p>He sat down at a rosewood desk, leaned his chin on <lb/>
the left-hand edge of it, and spoke, as if to the floor: <lb/>
"Aunt Susan!"</p>
<p>A low, pleasant voice answered, "Is that you, <lb/>
Alonzo?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm too lazy and comfortable to go down- <lb/>
stairs; I am in extremity, and I can't seem to scare up <lb/>
any help."</p>
<p>"Dear me, what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Matter enough, I can tell you!"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't keep me in suspense, dear! What <i>is</i> <lb/>
it?"</p>
<p>"I want to know what time it is."</p>
<p>"You abominable boy, what a turn you did give me! <lb/>
Is that all?"</p>
<p>"All&#x2014;on my honor. Calm yourself. Tell me the <lb/>
time, and receive my blessing."</p>
<p>"Just five minutes after nine. No charge&#x2014;keep <lb/>
your blessing."</p>
<p>"Thanks. It wouldn't have impoverished me, <lb/>
aunty, nor so enriched you that you could live without <lb/>
other means."</p>
<p>He got up, murmuring, "Just five minutes after <lb/>
nine," and faced his clock. "Ah," said he, "you <lb/>
<pb n="411"/>
are doing better than usual. You are only thirty-four <lb/>
minutes wrong. Let me see &#x2026;&#x2026; let me see <lb/>
&#x2026;&#x2026; Thirty-three and twenty-one are fifty-four; <lb/>
four times fifty-four are two hundred and thirty-six. <lb/>
One off, leaves two hundred and thirty-five. That's <lb/>
right."</p>
<p>He turned the hands of his clock forward till they <lb/>
marked twenty-five minutes to one, and said, "Now <lb/>
see if you can't keep right for a while &#x2026;&#x2026; else I'll <lb/>
raffle you!"</p>
<p>He sat down at the desk again, and said, "Aunt <lb/>
Susan!"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear."</p>
<p>"Had breakfast?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, an hour ago."</p>
<p>"Busy?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;except sewing. Why?"</p>
<p>"Got any company?"</p>
<p>"No, but I expect some at half-past nine."</p>
<p>"I wish <i>I</i> did. I'm lonesome. I want to talk to <lb/>
somebody."</p>
<p>"Very well, talk to me."</p>
<p>"But this is very private."</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid&#x2014;talk right along, there's nobody <lb/>
here but me."</p>
<p>"I hardly know whether to venture or not, but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But what? Oh, don't stop there! You <i>know</i> <lb/>
you can trust me, Alonzo&#x2014;you know you can."</p>
<p>"I feel it, aunt, but this is very serious. It affects <lb/>
me deeply&#x2014;me, and all the family&#x2014;even the whole <lb/>
community."</p>
<p>"Oh, Alonzo, tell me! I will never breathe a word <lb/>
of it. What is it?"</p>
<p>"Aunt, if I might dare&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, please go on! I love you, and feel for you. <lb/>
Tell me all. Confide in me. What <i>is</i> it?"</p>
<pb n="412"/>
<p>"The weather!"</p>
<p>"Plague take the weather! I don't see how you <lb/>
can have the heart to serve me so, Lon."</p>
<p>"There, there, aunty dear, I'm sorry; I am, on my <lb/>
honor. I won't do it again. Do you forgive me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, since you seem so sincere about it, though I <lb/>
know I oughtn't to. You will fool me again as soon <lb/>
as I have forgotten this time."</p>
<p>"No, I won't, honor bright. But such weather, oh, <lb/>
such weather! You've <i>got</i> to keep your spirits up <lb/>
artificially. It is snowy, and blowy, and gusty, and <lb/>
bitter cold! How is the weather with you?"</p>
<p>"Warm and rainy and melancholy. The mourners <lb/>
go about the streets with their umbrellas running <lb/>
streams from the end of every whalebone. There's an <lb/>
elevated double pavement of umbrellas stretching <lb/>
down the sides of the streets as far as I can see. I've <lb/>
got a fire for cheerfulness, and the windows open to keep <lb/>
cool. But it is vain, it is useless: nothing comes in <lb/>
but the balmy breath of December, with its burden of <lb/>
mocking odors from the flowers that possess the realm <lb/>
outside, and rejoice in their lawless profusion whilst the <lb/>
spirit of man is low, and flaunt their gaudy splendors <lb/>
in his face while his soul is clothed in sackcloth and <lb/>
ashes and his heart breaketh."</p>
<p>Alonzo opened his lips to say, "You ought to print <lb/>
that, and get it framed," but checked himself, for he <lb/>
heard his aunt speaking to some one else. He went <lb/>
and stood at the window and looked out upon the <lb/>
wintry prospect. The storm was driving the snow be- <lb/>
fore it more furiously than ever; window-shutters were <lb/>
slamming and banging; a forlorn dog, with bowed head <lb/>
and tail withdrawn from service, was pressing his <lb/>
quaking body against a windward wall for shelter and <lb/>
protection; a young girl was plowing knee-deep <lb/>
through the drifts, with her face turned from the blast, <lb/>
<pb n="413"/>
and the cape of her waterproof blowing straight rear- <lb/>
ward over her head. Alonzo shuddered, and said with <lb/>
a sigh, "Better the slop, and the sultry rain, and even <lb/>
the insolent flowers, than this!"</p>
<p>He turned from the window, moved a step, and <lb/>
Stopped in a listening attitude. The faint, sweet notes <lb/>
of a familiar song caught his ear. He remained there, <lb/>
with his head unconsciously bent forward, drinking in <lb/>
the melody, stirring neither hand nor foot, hardly <lb/>
breathing. There was a blemish in the execution of <lb/>
the song, but to Alonzo it seemed an added charm in- <lb/>
stead of a defect. This blemish consisted of a marked <lb/>
flatting of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh <lb/>
notes of the refrain or chorus of the piece. When the <lb/>
music ended, Alonzo drew a deep breath, and said <lb/>
"Ah, I never have heard 'In the Sweet By-and-by' <lb/>
sung like that before!"</p>
<p>He stepped quickly to the desk, listened a moment, <lb/>
and said in a guarded, confidential voice, "Aunty, who <lb/>
is this divine singer?"</p>
<p>"She is the company I was expecting. Stays with <lb/>
me a month or two. I will introduce you. Miss&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"For goodness' sake, wait a moment, Aunt Susan! <lb/>
You never stop to think what you are about!"</p>
<p>He flew to his bedchamber, and returned in a moment <lb/>
perceptibly changed in his outward appearance, and <lb/>
remarking, snappishly:</p>
<p>"Hang it, she would have introduced me to this <lb/>
angel in that sky-blue dressing-gown with red-hot <lb/>
lapels! Women never think, when they get a-going."</p>
<p>He hastened and stood by the desk, and said eagerly, <lb/>
"Now, Aunty, I am ready," and fell to smiling and <lb/>
bowing with all the persuasiveness and elegance that <lb/>
were in him.</p>
<p>"Very well. Miss Rosannah Ethelton, let me in- <lb/>
troduce to you my favorite nephew, Mr. Alonzo Fitz <lb/>
<pb n="414"/>
Clarence. There! You are both good people, and I <lb/>
like you; so I am going to trust you together while I <lb/>
attend to a few household affairs. Sit down, Rosannah; <lb/>
sit down, Alonzo. Good-bye; I sha'n't be gone <lb/>
long."</p>
<p>Alonzo had been bowing and smiling all the while, <lb/>
and motioning imaginary young ladies to sit down in <lb/>
imaginary chairs, but now he took a seat himself, <lb/>
mentally saying, "Oh, this is luck! Let the winds <lb/>
blow now, and the snow drive, and the heavens frown! <lb/>
Little I care!"</p>
<p>While these young people chat themselves into an <lb/>
acquaintanceship, let us take the liberty of inspecting <lb/>
the sweeter and fairer of the two. She sat alone, at <lb/>
her graceful ease, in a richly furnished apartment which <lb/>
was manifestly the private parlor of a refined and sensi- <lb/>
ble lady, if signs and symbols may go for anything. <lb/>
For instance, by a low, comfortable chair stood a <lb/>
dainty, top-heavy workstand, whose summit was a fan- <lb/>
cifully embroidered shallow basket, with varicolored <lb/>
crewels, and other strings and odds and ends protrud- <lb/>
ing from under the gaping lid and hanging down in <lb/>
negligent profusion. On the floor lay bright shreds of <lb/>
Turkey red, Prussian blue, and kindred fabrics, bits of <lb/>
ribbon, a spool or two, a pair of scissors, and a roll or <lb/>
so of tinted silken stuffs. On a luxurious sofa, up- <lb/>
holstered with some sort of soft Indian goods wrought <lb/>
in black and gold threads interwebbed with other <lb/>
threads not so pronounced in color, lay a great square <lb/>
of coarse white stuff, upon whose surface a rich bou- <lb/>
quet of flowers was growing, under the deft cultivation <lb/>
of the crochet-needle. The household cat was asleep <lb/>
on this work of art. In a bay-window stood an easel <lb/>
with an unfinished picture on it, and a palette and <lb/>
brushes on a chair beside it. There were books every- <lb/>
where: Robertson's Sermons, Tennyson, Moody and <lb/>
<pb n="415"/>
Sanky, Hawthorne, "Rab and his Friends," cook- <lb/>
books, prayer-books, pattern-books&#x2014;and books about <lb/>
all kinds of odious and exasperating pottery, of course. <lb/>
There was a piano, with a deck-load of music, and <lb/>
more in a tender. There was a great plenty of pictures <lb/>
on the walls, on the shelves of the mantel-piece, and <lb/>
around generally; where coigns of vantage offered were <lb/>
statuettes, and quaint and pretty gimcracks, and rare <lb/>
and costly specimens of peculiarly devilish china. The <lb/>
bay-window gave upon a garden that was ablaze with <lb/>
foreign and domestic flowers and flowering shrubs.</p>
<p>But the sweet young girl was the daintiest thing <lb/>
these premises, within or without, could offer for con- <lb/>
templation: delicately chiseled features, of Grecian <lb/>
cast; her complexion the pure snow of a japonica that <lb/>
is receiving a faint reflected enrichment from some scar- <lb/>
let neighbor of the garden; great, soft blue eyes fringed <lb/>
with long, curving lashes; an expression made up of <lb/>
the trustfulness of a child and the gentleness of a fawn; <lb/>
a beautiful head crowned with its own prodigal gold; <lb/>
a lithe and rounded figure, whose every attitude and <lb/>
movement were instinct with native grace.</p>
<p>Her dress and adornment were marked by that ex- <lb/>
quisite harmony that can come only of a fine natural <lb/>
taste perfected by culture. Her gown was of a simple <lb/>
magenta tulle, cut bias, traversed by three rows of light <lb/>
blue flounces, with the selvage edges turned up with <lb/>
ashes-of-roses chenille; overdress of dark bay tarlatan <lb/>
with scarlet satin lambrequins; corn-colored polonaise, <lb/>
<i>en panier</i>, looped with mother-of-pearl buttons and <lb/>
silver cord, and hauled aft and made fast by buff-velvet <lb/>
lashings; basque of lavender reps, picked out with <lb/>
valenciennes; low neck, short sleeves; maroon-velvet <lb/>
necktie edged with delicate pink silk; inside handker- <lb/>
chief of some simple three-ply ingrain fabric of a soft <lb/>
saffron tint; coral bracelets and locket-chain; coiffure <lb/>
<pb n="416"/>
of forget-me-nots and lilies of the valley massed around <lb/>
a noble calla.</p>
<p>This was all; yet even in this subdued attire she was <lb/>
divinely beautiful. Then what must she have been <lb/>
when adorned for the festival or the ball?</p>
<p>All this time she had been busily chatting with Alonzo, <lb/>
unconscious of our inspection. The minutes still sped, <lb/>
and still she talked. But by and by she happened to <lb/>
look up, and saw the clock. A crimson blush sent its <lb/>
rich flood through her cheeks, and she exclaimed:</p>
<p>"There, good-bye, Mr. Fitz Clarence; I must go <lb/>
now!"</p>
<p>She sprang from her chair with such haste that she <lb/>
hardly heard the young man's answering good-bye. <lb/>
She stood radiant, graceful, beautiful, and gazed, <lb/>
wondering, upon the accusing clock. Presently her <lb/>
pouting lips parted, and she said:</p>
<p>"Five minutes after eleven! Nearly two hours, and <lb/>
it did not seem twenty minutes! Oh, dear, what will <lb/>
he think of me!"</p>
<p>At the self-same moment Alonzo was staring at <i>his</i> <lb/>
clock. And presently he said:</p>
<p>"Twenty-five minutes to three! Nearly two hours, <lb/>
and I didn't believe it was two minutes! Is it possible <lb/>
that this clock is humbugging again? Miss Ethelton! <lb/>
Just one moment, please. Are you there yet?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but be quick; I'm going right away."</p>
<p>"Would you be so kind as to tell me what time it <lb/>
is?"</p>
<p>The girl blushed again, murmured to herself, "It's <lb/>
right down cruel of him to ask me!" and then spoke <lb/>
up and answered with admirably counterfeited uncon- <lb/>
cern, "Five minutes after eleven."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you! You have to go, now, have <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<pb n="417"/>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>"Miss Ethelton!"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"You&#x2014;you're there yet, <i>ain't</i> you?"</p>
<p>"Yes; but please hurry. What did you want to <lb/>
say?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&#x2014;well, nothing in particular. It's very <lb/>
lonesome here. It's asking a great deal, I know, but <lb/>
would you mind talking with me again by and by&#x2014; <lb/>
that is, if it will not trouble you too much?"</p>
<p>"I don't know&#x2014;but I'll think about it. I'll try."</p>
<p>"Oh, thanks! Miss Ethelton! &#x2026;&#x2026; Ah, me, <lb/>
she's gone, and here are the black clouds and the whirl- <lb/>
ing snow and the raging winds come again! But she <lb/>
said <i>good-bye</i>. She didn't say good-morning, she said <lb/>
good-bye! &#x2026;&#x2026; The clock was right, after all. <lb/>
What a lightning-winged two hours it was!"</p>
<p>He sat down, and gazed dreamily into his fire for <lb/>
awhile, then heaved a sigh and said:</p>
<p>"How wonderful it is! Two little hours ago I was <lb/>
a free man, and now my heart's in San Francisco!"</p>
<p>About that time Rosannah Ethelton, propped in the <lb/>
window-seat of her bed-chamber, book in hand, was <lb/>
gazing vacantly out over the rainy seas that washed the <lb/>
Golden Gate, and whispering to herself, "How differ- <lb/>
ent he is from poor Burley, with his empty head and <lb/>
his single little antic talent of mimicry!"</p>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II">
<head><b>II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Four</smcap> weeks later Mr. Sidney Algernon Burley was <lb/>
entertaining a gay luncheon company, in a sumptuous <lb/>
drawing-room on Telegraph Hill, with some capital <lb/>
<pb n="418"/>
imitations of the voices and gestures of certain popular <lb/>
actors and San Franciscan literary people and Bonanza <lb/>
grandees. He was elegantly upholstered, and was a <lb/>
handsome fellow, barring a trifling cast in his eye. He <lb/>
seemed very jovial, but nevertheless he kept his eye on <lb/>
the door with an expectant and uneasy watchfulness. <lb/>
By and by a nobby lackey appeared, and delivered a <lb/>
message to the mistress, who nodded her head under- <lb/>
standingly. That seemed to settle the thing for Mr. <lb/>
Burley; his vivacity decreased little by little, and a de- <lb/>
jected look began to creep into one of his eyes and a <lb/>
sinister one into the other.</p>
<p>The rest of the company departed in due time, leav- <lb/>
ing him with the mistress, to whom he said:</p>
<p>"There is no longer any question about it. She <lb/>
avoids me. She continually excuses herself. If I <lb/>
could see her, if I could speak to her only a moment <lb/>
&#x2014;but this suspense&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Perhaps her seeming avoidance is mere accident, <lb/>
Mr. Burley. Go to the small drawing-room upstairs <lb/>
and amuse yourself a moment. I will despatch a <lb/>
household order that is on my mind, and then I will go <lb/>
to her room. Without doubt she will be persuaded to <lb/>
see you."</p>
<p>Mr. Burley went upstairs, intending to go to the <lb/>
small drawing-room, but as he was passing "Aunt <lb/>
Susan's" private parlor, the door of which stood <lb/>
slightly ajar, he heard a joyous laugh which he recog- <lb/>
nized; so without knock or announcement he stepped <lb/>
confidently in. But before he could make his presence <lb/>
known he heard words that harrowed up his soul and <lb/>
chilled his young blood. He heard a voice say:</p>
<p>"Darling, it has come!"</p>
<p>Then he heard Rosannah Ethelton, whose back was <lb/>
toward him, say:</p>
<p>"So has yours, dearest!"</p>
<pb n="419"/>
<p>He saw her bowed form bend lower; he heard her <lb/>
kiss something&#x2014;not merely once, but again and again! <lb/>
His soul raged within him. The heart-breaking con- <lb/>
versation went on:</p>
<p>"Rosannah, I knew you must be beautiful, but this <lb/>
is dazzling, this is blinding, this is intoxicating!"</p>
<p>"Alonzo, it is such happiness to hear you say it. I <lb/>
know it is not true, but I am <i>so</i> grateful to have you <lb/>
think it is, nevertheless! I knew you must have a <lb/>
noble face, but the grace and majesty of the reality <lb/>
beggar the poor creation of my fancy."</p>
<p>Burley heard that rattling shower of kisses again.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my Rosannah! The photograph flat- <lb/>
ters me, but you must not allow yourself to think of <lb/>
that. Sweetheart?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Alonzo."</p>
<p>"I am so happy, Rosannah."</p>
<p>"Oh, Alonzo, none that have gone before me knew <lb/>
what love was, none that come after me will ever know <lb/>
what happiness is. I float in a gorgeous cloudland, a <lb/>
boundless firmament of enchanted and bewildering <lb/>
ecstasy!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my Rosannah!&#x2014;for you are mine, are you <lb/>
not?"</p>
<p>"Wholly, oh, wholly yours, Alonzo, now and for- <lb/>
ever! All the day long, and all through my nightly <lb/>
dreams, one song sings itself, and its sweet burden is, <lb/>
'Alonzo Fitz Clarence, Alonzo Fitz Clarence, Eastport, <lb/>
State of Maine!"</p>
<p>"Curse him, I've got his address, anyway!" roared <lb/>
Burley, inwardly, and rushed from the place.</p>
<p>Just behind the unconscious Alonzo stood his mother, <lb/>
a picture of astonishment. She was so muffled from <lb/>
head to heel in furs that nothing of herself was visible <lb/>
but her eyes and nose. She was a good allegory of <lb/>
winter, for she was powdered all over with snow.</p>
<pb n="420"/>
<p>Behind the unconscious Rosannah stood "Aunt <lb/>
Susan," another picture of astonishment. She was a <lb/>
good allegory of summer, for she was lightly clad, <lb/>
and was vigorously cooling the perspiration on her <lb/>
face with a fan.</p>
<p>Both of these women had tears of joy in their eyes.</p>
<p>"So ho!" exclaimed Mrs. Fitz Clarence, "this ex- <lb/>
plains why nobody has been able to drag you out of <lb/>
your room for six weeks, Alonzo!"</p>
<p>"So ho!" exclaimed Aunt Susan, "this explains <lb/>
why you have been a hermit for the past six weeks, <lb/>
Rosannah!"</p>
<p>The young couple were on their feet in an instant, <lb/>
abashed, and standing like detected dealers in stolen <lb/>
goods awaiting Judge Lynch's doom.</p>
<p>"Bless you, my son! I am happy in your hap- <lb/>
piness. Come to your mother's arms, Alonzo!"</p>
<p>"Bless you, Rosannah, for my dear nephew's sake! <lb/>
Come to my arms!"</p>
<p>Then was there a mingling of hearts and of tears of <lb/>
rejoicing on Telegraph Hill and in Eastport Square.</p>
<p>Servants were called by the elders, in both places. <lb/>
Unto one was given the order, "Pile this fire high <lb/>
with hickory wood, and bring me a roasting-hot lemon- <lb/>
ade."</p>
<p>Unto the other was given the order, "Put out this <lb/>
fire, and bring me two palmleaf fans and a pitcher of <lb/>
ice-water."</p>
<p>Then the young people were dismissed, and the <lb/>
elders sat down to talk the sweet surprise over and make <lb/>
the wedding plans.</p>
<p>Some minutes before this Mr. Burley rushed from <lb/>
the mansion on Telegraph Hill without meeting or tak- <lb/>
ing formal leave of anybody. He hissed through his <lb/>
teeth, in unconscious imitation of a popular favorite in <lb/>
<pb n="421"/>
melodrama, "Him shall she never wed! I have sworn <lb/>
it! Ere great Nature shall have doffed her winter's <lb/>
ermine to don the emerald gauds of spring, she shall <lb/>
be mine!"</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="III">
<head><b>III.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Two</smcap> weeks later. Every few hours, during some <lb/>
three or four days, a very prim and devout-looking <lb/>
Episcopal clergyman, with a cast in his eye, had visited <lb/>
Alonzo. According to his card, he was the Rev. <lb/>
Melton Hargrave, of Cincinnati. He said he had re- <lb/>
tired from the ministry on account of his health. If he <lb/>
had said on account of ill-health, he would probably <lb/>
have erred, to judge by his wholesome looks and firm <lb/>
build. He was the inventor of an improvement in tele- <lb/>
phones, and hoped to make his bread by selling the <lb/>
privilege of using it. "At present," he continued, <lb/>
"a man may go and tap a telegraph wire which is <lb/>
conveying a song or a concert from one State to another, <lb/>
and he can attach his private telephone and steal a <lb/>
hearing of that music as it passes along. My inven- <lb/>
tion will stop all that."</p>
<p>"Well, answered Alonzo, "if the owner of the <lb/>
music could not miss what was stolen, why should he <lb/>
care?"</p>
<p>"He shouldn't care," said the Reverend.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Alonzo, inquiringly.</p>
<p>"Suppose," replied the Reverend, "suppose that, <lb/>
instead of music that was passing along and being <lb/>
stolen, the burden of the wire was loving endearments <lb/>
of the most private and sacred nature?"</p>
<p>Alonzo shuddered from head to heel. "Sir, it is a <lb/>
priceless invention," said he; "I must have it at any <lb/>
cost."</p>
<pb n="422"/>
<p>But the invention was delayed somewhere on the road <lb/>
from Cincinnati, most unaccountably. The impatient <lb/>
Alonzo could hardly wait. The thought of Rosannah's <lb/>
sweet words being shared with him by some ribald thief <lb/>
was galling to him. The Reverend came frequently <lb/>
and lamented the delay, and told of measures he had <lb/>
taken to hurry things up. This was some little com- <lb/>
fort to Alonzo.</p>
<p>One forenoon the Reverend ascended the stairs and <lb/>
knocked at Alonzo's door. There was no response. <lb/>
He entered, glanced eagerly around, closed the door <lb/>
softly, then ran to the telephone. The exquisitely soft <lb/>
and remote strains of the "Sweet By-and-by" came <lb/>
floating through the instrument. The singer was <lb/>
flatting, as usual, the five notes that follow the first <lb/>
two in the chorus, when the Reverend interrupted her <lb/>
with this word, in a voice which was an exact imitation <lb/>
of Alonzo's, with just the faintest flavor of impatience <lb/>
added:</p>
<p>"Sweetheart?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Alonzo?"</p>
<p>"Please don't sing that any more this week&#x2014;try <lb/>
something modern."</p>
<p>The agile step that goes with a happy heart was heard <lb/>
on the stairs, and the Reverend, smiling diabolically, <lb/>
sought sudden refuge behind the heavy folds of the <lb/>
velvet window-curtains. Alonzo entered and flew to <lb/>
the telephone. Said he:</p>
<p>"Rosannah, dear, shall we sing something together?"</p>
<p>"Something <i>modern?</i>" asked she, with sarcastic <lb/>
bitterness.</p>
<p>"Yes, if you prefer."</p>
<p>"Sing it yourself, if you like!"</p>
<p>This snappishness amazed and wounded the young <lb/>
man. He said:</p>
<p>"Rosannah, that was not like you."</p>
<pb n="423"/>
<p>"I suppose it becomes me as much as your very <lb/>
polite speech became you, Mr. Fitz Clarence."</p>
<p>"<i>Mister</i> Fitz Clarence! Rosannah, there was noth- <lb/>
ing impolite about my speech."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed! Of course, then, I misunderstood <lb/>
you, and I most humbly beg your pardon, ha-ha-ha! <lb/>
No doubt you said, 'Don't sing it any more <i>to-day</i>.'"</p>
<p>"Sing <i>what</i> any more to-day?"</p>
<p>"The song you mentioned, of course. How very <lb/>
obtuse we are, all of a sudden!"</p>
<p>"I never mentioned any song."</p>
<p>"Oh, you <i>didn't?</i>"</p>
<p>"No, I <i>didn't!</i>"</p>
<p>"I am compelled to remark that you <i>did</i>."</p>
<p>"And I am obliged to reiterate that I <i>didn't</i>."</p>
<p>"A second rudeness! That is sufficient, sir. I will <lb/>
never forgive you. All is over between us."</p>
<p>Then came a muffled sound of crying. Alonzo <lb/>
hastened to say:</p>
<p>'Oh, Rosannah, unsay those words! There is some <lb/>
dreadful mystery here, some hideous mistake. I am <lb/>
utterly earnest and sincere when I say I never said <lb/>
anything about any song. I would not hurt you for <lb/>
the whole world &#x2026;&#x2026; Rosannah, dear! &#x2026;&#x2026; <lb/>
Oh, speak to me, won't you?"</p>
<p>There was a pause; then Alonzo heard the girl's <lb/>
sobbings retreating, and knew she had gone from the <lb/>
telephone. He rose with a heavy sigh, and hastened <lb/>
from the room, saying to himself, "I will ransack the <lb/>
charity missions and the haunts of the poor for my <lb/>
mother. She will persuade her that I never meant to <lb/>
wound her."</p>
<p>A minute later, the Reverend was crouching over the <lb/>
telephone like a cat that knoweth the ways of the prey. <lb/>
He had not very many minutes to wait. A soft, re- <lb/>
pentant voice, tremulous with tears, said:</p>
<pb n="424"/>
<p>"Alonzo, dear, I have been wrong. You <i>could</i> not <lb/>
have said so cruel a thing. It must have been some <lb/>
one who imitated your voice in malice or in jest."</p>
<p>The Reverend coldy answered, in Alonzo's tones:</p>
<p>"You have said all was over between us. So let it <lb/>
be. I spurn your proffered repentance, and despise <lb/>
it!"</p>
<p>Then he departed, radiant with fiendish triumph, to <lb/>
return no more with his imaginary telephonic invention <lb/>
forever.</p>
<p>Four hours afterward, Alonzo arrived with his mother <lb/>
from her favorite haunts of poverty and vice. They <lb/>
summoned the San Francisco household; but there was <lb/>
no reply. They waited, and continued to wait, upon <lb/>
the voiceless telephone.</p>
<p>At length, when it was sunset in San Francisco, and <lb/>
three hours and a half after dark in Eastport, an answer <lb/>
came to the oft-repeated cry of "Rosannah!"</p>
<p>But, alas, it was Aunt Susan's voice that spake. <lb/>
She said:</p>
<p>"I have been out all day; just got in. I will go and <lb/>
find her."</p>
<p>The watchers waited two minutes&#x2014;five minutes&#x2014; <lb/>
ten minutes. Then came these fatal words, in a fright- <lb/>
ened tone:</p>
<p>"She is gone, and her baggage with her. To visit <lb/>
another friend, she told the servants. But I found this <lb/>
note on the table in her room. Listen: 'I am gone; <lb/>
seek not to trace me out; my heart is broken; you will <lb/>
never see me more. Tell him I shall always think of <lb/>
him when I sing my poor "Sweet By-and-by," but <lb/>
never of the unkind words he said about it.' That is <lb/>
her note. Alonzo, Alonzo, what does it mean? What <lb/>
has happened?"</p>
<p>But Alonzo sat white and cold as the dead. His <lb/>
mother threw back the velvet curtains and opened a <lb/>
<pb n="425"/>
window. The cold air refreshed the sufferer, and he <lb/>
told his aunt his dismal story. Meantime his mother <lb/>
was inspecting a card which had disclosed itself upon <lb/>
the floor when she cast the curtains back. It read, <lb/>
"Mr. Sidney Algernon Burley, San Francisco."</p>
<p>"The miscreant!" shouted Alonzo, and rushed forth <lb/>
to seek the false Reverend and destroy him; for the <lb/>
card explained everything, since in the course of the <lb/>
lovers' mutual confessions they had told each other all <lb/>
about all the sweethearts they had ever had, and <lb/>
thrown no end of mud at their failings and foibles&#x2014;for <lb/>
lovers always do that. It has a fascination that ranks <lb/>
next after billing and cooing.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IV">
<head><b>IV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>During</smcap> the next two months many things hap- <lb/>
pened. It had early transpired that Rosannah, poor <lb/>
suffering orphan, had neither returned to her grand- <lb/>
mother in Portland, Oregon, nor sent any word to her <lb/>
save a duplicate of the woful note she had left in the <lb/>
mansion on Telegraph Hill. Whosoever was shelter- <lb/>
ing her&#x2014;if she was still alive&#x2014;had been persuaded <lb/>
not to betray her whereabouts, without doubt; for all <lb/>
efforts to find trace of her had failed.</p>
<p>Did Alonzo give her up? Not he. He said to <lb/>
himself, "She will sing that sweet song when she is <lb/>
sad; I shall find her." So he took his carpet-sack <lb/>
and a portable telephone, and shook the snow of his <lb/>
native city from his arctics, and went forth into the <lb/>
world. He wandered far and wide and in many States. <lb/>
Time and again, strangers were astounded to see a <lb/>
wasted, pale, and woe-worn man laboriously climb a <lb/>
telegraph-pole in wintry and lonely places, perch sadly <lb/>
<pb n="426"/>
there an hour, with his ear at a little box, then come <lb/>
sighing down, and wander wearily away. Sometimes <lb/>
they shot at him, as peasants do at aeronauts, thinking <lb/>
him mad and dangerous. Thus his clothes were much <lb/>
shredded by bullets and his person grievously lacerated. <lb/>
But he bore it all patiently.</p>
<p>In the beginning of his pilgrimage he used often to <lb/>
say, "Ah, if I could but hear the 'Sweet By and <lb/>
By'!" But toward the end of it he used to shed tears <lb/>
of anguish and say, "Ah, if I could but hear some- <lb/>
thing else!"</p>
<p>Thus a month and three weeks drifted by, and at <lb/>
last some humane people seized him and confined him <lb/>
in a private mad-house in New York. He made no <lb/>
moan, for his strength was all gone, and with it all <lb/>
heart and all hope. The superintendent, in pity, gave <lb/>
up his own comfortable parlor and bedchamber to him <lb/>
and nursed him with affectionate devotion.</p>
<p>At the end of a week the patient was able to leave <lb/>
his bed for the first time. He was lying, comfortably <lb/>
pillowed, on a sofa, listening to the plaintive Miserere <lb/>
of the bleak March winds, and the muffled sound of <lb/>
tramping feet in the street below&#x2014;for it was about <lb/>
six in the evening, and New York was going home <lb/>
from work. He had a bright fire and the added cheer <lb/>
of a couple of student lamps. So it was warm and <lb/>
snug within, though bleak and raw without; it was <lb/>
light and bright within, though outside it was as dark <lb/>
and dreary as if the world had been lit with Hartford <lb/>
gas. Alonzo smiled feebly to think how his loving <lb/>
vagaries had made him a maniac in the eyes of the <lb/>
world, and was proceeding to pursue his line of thought <lb/>
further, when a faint, sweet strain, the very ghost of <lb/>
sound, so remote and attenuated it seemed, struck <lb/>
upon his ear. His pulses stood still; he listened <lb/>
with parted lips and bated breath. The song flowed <lb/>
<pb n="427"/>
on&#x2014;he waiting, listening, rising slowly and uncon- <lb/>
sciously from his recumbent position. At last he ex- <lb/>
claimed:</p>
<p>"It is! it is she! Oh, the divine flatted notes!"</p>
<p>He dragged himself eagerly to the corner whence the <lb/>
sounds proceeded, tore aside a curtain, and discovered <lb/>
a telephone. He bent over, and as the last note died <lb/>
away he burst forth with the exclamation:</p>
<p>"Oh, thank Heavens, found at last! Speak to me, <lb/>
Rosannah, dearest! The cruel mystery has been un- <lb/>
raveled; it was the villain Burley who mimicked my <lb/>
voice and wounded you with insolent speech!"</p>
<p>There was a breathless pause, a waiting age to <lb/>
Alonzo; then a faint sound came, framing itself into <lb/>
language:</p>
<p>"Oh, say those precious words again, Alonzo!"</p>
<p>"They are the truth, the veritable truth, my Rosan- <lb/>
nah, and you shall have the proof, ample and abundant <lb/>
proof!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Alonzo, stay by me! Leave me not for a <lb/>
moment! Let me feel that you are near me! Tell <lb/>
me we shall never be parted more! Oh, this happy <lb/>
hour, this blessed hour, this memorable hour!"</p>
<p>"We will make record of it, my Rosannah; every <lb/>
year, as this dear hour chimes from the clock, we will <lb/>
celebrate it with thanksgivings, all the years of our <lb/>
life."</p>
<p>"We will, we will, Alonzo!"</p>
<p>"Four minutes after six, in the evening, my Rosan- <lb/>
nah, shall henceforth&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Twenty-three minutes after twelve, afternoon, <lb/>
shall&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, Rosannah, darling, where are you?"</p>
<p>"In Honolulu, Sandwich Islands. And where are <lb/>
you? Stay by me; do not leave me for a moment. I <lb/>
cannot bear it. Are you at home?"</p>
<pb n="428"/>
<p>"No, dear, I am in New York&#x2014;a patient in the <lb/>
doctor's hands."</p>
<p>An agonizing shriek came buzzing to Alonzo's ear, <lb/>
like the sharp buzzing of a hurt gnat; it lost power in <lb/>
traveling five thousand miles. Alonzo hastened to say:</p>
<p>"Calm yourself, my child. It is nothing. Already <lb/>
I am getting well under the sweet healing of your <lb/>
presence. Rosannah?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Alonzo? Oh, how you terrified me! Say <lb/>
on."</p>
<p>"Name the happy day, Rosannah!"</p>
<p>There was a little pause. Then a diffident small <lb/>
voice replied, "I blush&#x2014;but it is with pleasure, it is <lb/>
with happiness. Would&#x2014;would you like to have it <lb/>
soon?"</p>
<p>"This very night, Rosannah! Oh, let us risk no <lb/>
more delays. Let it be now! &#x2014;this very night, this <lb/>
very moment!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you impatient creature! I have nobody here <lb/>
but my good old uncle, a missionary for a generation, <lb/>
and now retired from service&#x2014;nobody but him and <lb/>
his wife. I would so dearly like it if your mother and <lb/>
your Aunt Susan&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<i>Our</i> mother and <i>our</i> Aunt Susan, my Rosannah."</p>
<p>"Yes, <i>our</i> mother and <i>our</i> Aunt Susan&#x2014;I am con- <lb/>
tent to word it so if it pleases you; I would so like to <lb/>
have them present."</p>
<p>"So would I. Suppose you telegraph Aunt Susan. <lb/>
How long would it take her to come?"</p>
<p>"The steamer leaves San Francisco day after to- <lb/>
morrow. The passage is eight days. She would be <lb/>
here the 31st of March."</p>
<p>"Then name the 1st of April; do, Rosannah, dear."</p>
<p>"Mercy, it would make us April fools, Alonzo!"</p>
<p>"So we be the happiest ones that that day's sun <lb/>
looks down upon in the whole broad expanse of the <lb/>
<pb n="429"/>
globe, why need we care? Call it the 1st of April, <lb/>
dear."</p>
<p>"Then the 1st of April it shall be, with all my <lb/>
heart!"</p>
<p>"Oh, happiness! Name the hour, too, Rosannah."</p>
<p>"I like the morning, it is so blithe. Will eight in <lb/>
the morning do, Alonzo?"</p>
<p>"The loveliest hour in the day&#x2014;since it will make <lb/>
you mine."</p>
<p>There was a feeble but frantic sound for some little <lb/>
time, as if wool-lipped, disembodied spirits were ex- <lb/>
changing kisses; then Rosannah said, "Excuse me <lb/>
just a moment, dear; I have an appointment, and am <lb/>
called to meet it."</p>
<p>The young girl sought a large parlor and took her <lb/>
place at a window which looked out upon a beautiful <lb/>
scene. To the left one could view the charming <lb/>
Nuuana Valley, fringed with its ruddy flush of tropical <lb/>
flowers and its plumed and graceful cocoa palms; its <lb/>
rising foot-hills clothed in the shining green of lemon, <lb/>
citron, and orange groves; its storied precipice beyond, <lb/>
where the first Kamehameha drove his defeated foes <lb/>
over to their destruction&#x2014;a spot that had forgotten <lb/>
its grim history, no doubt, for now it was smiling, as <lb/>
almost always at noonday, under the glowing arches of <lb/>
a succession of rainbows. In front of the window one <lb/>
could see the quaint town, and here and there a pic- <lb/>
turesque group of dusky natives, enjoying the blister- <lb/>
ing weather; and far to the right lay the restless ocean, <lb/>
tossing its white mane in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Rosannah stood there, in her filmy white raiment, <lb/>
fanning her flushed and heated face, waiting. A <lb/>
Kanaka boy, clothed in a damaged blue necktie and <lb/>
part of a silk hat, thrust his head in at the door, and <lb/>
announced, "'Frisco <i>haole!</i>"</p>
<p>"Show him in," said the girl, straightening herself <lb/>
<pb n="430"/>
up and assuming a meaning dignity. Mr. Sidney <lb/>
Algernon Burley entered, clad from head to heel in <lb/>
dazzling snow&#x2014;that is to say, in the lightest and <lb/>
whitest of Irish linen. He moved eagerly forward, but <lb/>
the girl made a gesture and gave him a look which <lb/>
checked him suddenly. She said, coldly, "I am here, <lb/>
as I promised. I believed your assertions, I yielded to <lb/>
your importunities, and said I would name the day. I <lb/>
name the 1st of April&#x2014;eight in the morning. Now <lb/>
go!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dearest, if the gratitude of a lifetime&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Not a word. Spare me all sight of you, all com- <lb/>
munication with you, until that hour. No&#x2014;no sup- <lb/>
plications; I will have it so."</p>
<p>When he was gone, she sank exhausted in a chair, <lb/>
for the long siege of troubles she had undergone had <lb/>
wasted her strength. Presently she said, "What a <lb/>
narrow escape! If the hour appointed had been an <lb/>
hour earlier&#x2014;Oh, horror, what an escape I have made! <lb/>
And to think I had come to imagine I was loving this <lb/>
beguiling, this truthless, this treacherous monster! <lb/>
Oh, he shall repent his villainy!"</p>
<p>Let us now draw this history to a close, for little <lb/>
more needs to be told. On the 2d of the ensuing <lb/>
April, the Honolulu <i>Advertiser</i> contained this notice: <lb/>
<q><smcap>Married</smcap>.&#x2014;In this city, by telephone, yesterday morning, at eight <lb/>
o'clock, by Rev. Nathan Hays, assisted by Rev. Nathaniel Davis, of New <lb/>
York, Mr. Alonzo Fitz Clarence, of Eastport, Maine, U. S., and Miss <lb/>
Rosannah Ethelton, of Portland, Oregon, U. S. Mrs. Susan Howland, of <lb/>
San Francisco, a friend of the bride, was present, she being the guest of <lb/>
the Rev. Mr. Hays and wife, uncle and aunt of the bride. Mr. Sidney <lb/>
Algernon Burley, of San Francisco, was also present but did not remain till <lb/>
the conclusion of the marriage service. Captain Hawthorne's beautiful <lb/>
yacht, tastefully decorated, was in waiting, and the happy bride and her <lb/>
friends immediately departed on a bridal trip to Lahaina and Haleakala.</q></p>
<pb n="431"/>
<p>The New York papers of the same date contained <lb/>
this notice: <lb/>
<q><smcap>Married</smcap>.&#x2014;In this city, yesterday, by telephone, at half-past two in the <lb/>
morning, by Rev. Nathaniel Davis, assisted by Rev. Nathan Hays, of Hon- <lb/>
olulu, Mr. Alonzo Fitz Clarence, of Eastport, Maine, and Miss Rosannah <lb/>
Ethelton, of Portland, Oregon. The parents and several friends of the <lb/>
bridegroom were present, and enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast and much <lb/>
festivity until nearly sunrise, and then departed on a bridal trip to the <lb/>
Aquarium, the bridegroom's state of health not admitting of a more ex- <lb/>
tended journey.</q></p>
<p>Toward the close of that memorable day, Mr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Alonzo Fitz Clarence were buried in sweet con- <lb/>
verse concerning the pleasures of their several bridal <lb/>
tours, when suddenly the young wife exclaimed: "Oh, <lb/>
Lonny, I forgot! I did what I said I would."</p>
<p>"Did you, dear?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I did. I made <i>him</i> the April fool! And <lb/>
I told him so, too! Ah, it was a charming surprise! <lb/>
There he stood, sweltering in a black dress suit, with <lb/>
the mercury leaking out of the top of the thermometer, <lb/>
waiting to be married. You should have seen the look <lb/>
he gave when I whispered it in his ear. Ah, his <lb/>
wickedness cost me many a heartache and many a <lb/>
tear, but the score was all squared up, then. So the <lb/>
vengeful feeling went right out of my heart, and I <lb/>
begged him to stay, and said I forgave him everything. <lb/>
But he wouldn't. He said he would live to be <lb/>
avenged; said he would make our lives a curse to us. <lb/>
But he can't, <i>can</i> he, dear?"</p>
<p>"Never in this world, my Rosannah!"</p>
<p>Aunt Susan, the Oregonian grandmother, and the <lb/>
young couple and their Eastport parents, are all happy <lb/>
at this writing, and likely to remain so. Aunt Susan <lb/>
brought the bride from the islands, accompanied her <lb/>
<pb n="432"/>
across our continent, and had the happiness of witness- <lb/>
ing the rapturous meeting between an adoring husband <lb/>
and wife who had never seen each other until that <lb/>
moment.</p>
<p>A word about the wretched Burley, whose wicked <lb/>
machinations came so near wrecking the hearts and <lb/>
lives of our poor young friends, will be sufficient. In <lb/>
a murderous attempt to seize a crippled and helpless <lb/>
artisan who he fancied had done him some small <lb/>
offense, he fell into a caldron of boiling oil and expired <lb/>
before he could be extinguished.</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<div2 type="chapter">
<head><smcap>to the reader</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> accompanying map explains itself.</p>
<p>The idea of this map is not original with me, <lb/>
but is borrowed from the great metropolitan journals.</p>
<p>I claim no other merit for this production (if I may <lb/>
so call it) than that it is accurate. The main blemish <lb/>
of the city paper maps, of which it is an imitation, is <lb/>
that in them more attention seems paid to artistic <lb/>
picturesqueness than geographical reliability.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as this is the first time I ever tried to draft <lb/>
and engrave a map, or attempted anything in any line <lb/>
of art, the commendations the work has received and <lb/>
the admiration it has excited among the people have <lb/>
been very grateful to my feelings. And it is touching <lb/>
to reflect that by far the most enthusiastic of these <lb/>
praises have come from people who knew nothing at <lb/>
all about art.</p>
<p>By an unimportant oversight I have engraved the <lb/>
map so that it reads wrong end first, except to left- <lb/>
handed people. I forgot that in order to make it right <lb/>
in print, it should be drawn and engraved upside <lb/>
down. However, let the student who desires to con- <lb/>
template the map stand on his head or hold it before a <lb/>
looking-glass. That will bring it right.</p>
<p>The reader will comprehend at a glance that that <lb/>
<pb n="434"/>
piece of river with the "High Bridge" over it got left <lb/>
out to one side by reason of a slip of the graving-tool, <lb/>
which rendered it necessary to change the entire course <lb/>
of the River Rhine, or else spoil the map. After <lb/>
having spent two days in digging and gouging at the <lb/>
map, I would have changed the course of the Atlantic <lb/>
Ocean before I would lose so much work.</p>
<p>I never had so much trouble with anything in my <lb/>
life as I had with this map. I had heaps of little <lb/>
fortifications scattered all around Paris at first, but <lb/>
every now and then my instruments would slip and <lb/>
fetch away whole miles of batteries, and leave the <lb/>
vicinity as clean as if the Prussians had been there.</p>
<p>The reader will find it well to frame this map for <lb/>
future reference, so that it may aid in extending <lb/>
popular intelligence, and in dispelling the widespread <lb/>
ignorance of the day.</p>

<salute><smcap>To the Chairman:</smcap></salute>
</opener>
<p><smcap>Dear Sir</smcap>,&#x2014;I am very sorry that I cannot be with <lb/>
the Knights of St. Patrick to-morrow evening. In this <lb/>
centennial year we ought to find a peculiar pleasure in <lb/>
doing honor to the memory of a man whose good <lb/>
name has endured through fourteen centuries. We <lb/>
ought to find pleasure in it for the reason that at this <lb/>
time we naturally have a fellow-feeling for such a man. <lb/>
He wrought a great work in his day. He found Ire- <lb/>
land a prosperous republic, and looked about him to <lb/>
see if he might find some useful thing to turn his hand <lb/>
to. He observed that the president of that republic <lb/>
was in the habit of sheltering his great officials from <lb/>
deserved punishment, so he lifted up his staff and smote <lb/>
him, and he died. He found that the secretary of war <lb/>
had been so unbecomingly economical as to have laid <lb/>
up &#x0024;12,000 a year out of a salary of &#x0024;8,000, and he <lb/>
killed him. He found that the secretary of the interior <lb/>
always prayed over every separate and distinct barrel <lb/>
of salt beef that was intended for the unconverted sav- <lb/>
age, and then kept that beef himself, so he killed him <lb/>
also. He found that the secretary of the navy knew <lb/>
more about handling suspicious claims than he did <lb/>
<pb n="438"/>
about handling a ship, and he at once made an end of <lb/>
him. He found that a very foul private secretary had <lb/>
been engineered through a sham trial, so he destroyed <lb/>
him. He discovered that the congress which pretended <lb/>
to prodigious virtue was very anxious to investigate an <lb/>
ambassador who had dishonored the country abroad, <lb/>
but was equally anxious to prevent the appointment of <lb/>
any spotless man to a similar post; that this congress <lb/>
had no God but party; no system of morals but party <lb/>
policy; no vision but a bat's vision; and no reason or <lb/>
excuse for existing anyhow. Therefore he massacred <lb/>
that congress to the last man.</p>
<p>When he had finished his great work, he said, in his <lb/>
figurative way, "Lo, I have destroyed all the reptiles <lb/>
in Ireland."</p>
<p>St. Patrick had no politics; his sympathies lay with <lb/>
the right&#x2014;that was politics enough. When he <lb/>
came across a reptile, he forgot to inquire whether he <lb/>
was a democrat or a republican, but simply exalted his <lb/>
staff and "let him have it." Honored be his name <lb/>
&#x2014;I wish we had him here to trim us up for the centen- <lb/>
nial. But that cannot be. His staff, which was the <lb/>
symbol of real, not sham reform, is idle. However, <lb/>
we still have with us the symbol of Truth&#x2014;George <lb/>
Washington's little hatchet&#x2014;for I know where they've <lb/>
buried it.</p>
