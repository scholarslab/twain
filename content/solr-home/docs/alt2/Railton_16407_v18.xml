<head><b>CHAPTER XXVIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> troops must have a rest. Two days would <lb/>
be allowed for this.</p>
<p>The morning of the 14th I was writing from <lb/>
Joan's dictation in a small room which she some- <lb/>
times used as a private office when she wanted to <lb/>
get away from officials and their interruptions. <lb/>
Catherine Boucher came in and sat down and said:</p>
<p>"Joan, dear, I want you to talk to me."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I am not sorry for that, but glad. What <lb/>
is in your mind?"</p>
<p>"This. I scarcely slept last night, for thinking <lb/>
of the dangers you are running. The Paladin told <lb/>
me how you made the duke stand out of the way <lb/>
when the cannon-balls were flying all about, and so <lb/>
saved his life."</p>
<p>"Well, that was right, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Right? Yes; but you stayed there yourself. <lb/>
Why will you do like that? It seems such a wanton <lb/>
risk."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, it was not so. I was not in any <lb/>
danger."</p>
<p>"How can you say that, Joan, with those deadly <lb/>
things flying all about you?"</p>
<pb n="8"/>
<p>Joan laughed, and tried to turn the subject, but <lb/>
Catherine persisted. She said:</p>
<p>"It was horribly dangerous, and it could not be <lb/>
necessary to stay in such a place. And you led an <lb/>
assault again. Joan, it is tempting Providence. I <lb/>
want you to make me a promise. I want you to <lb/>
promise me that you will let others lead the assaults, <lb/>
if there <i>must</i> be assaults, and that you will take <lb/>
better care of yourself in those dreadful battles. <lb/>
Will you?"</p>
<p>But Joan fought away from the promise and did <lb/>
not give it. Catherine sat troubled and discontented <lb/>
awhile, then she said:</p>
<p>"Joan, are you going to be a soldier always? <lb/>
These wars are so long&#x2014;so long. They last for- <lb/>
ever and ever and ever."</p>
<p>There was a glad flash in Joan's eye as she cried:</p>
<p>"This campaign will do all the really hard work <lb/>
that is in front of it in the next four days. The rest <lb/>
of it will be gentler&#x2014;oh, far less bloody. Yes, in <lb/>
four days France will gather another trophy like the <lb/>
redemption of Orleans and make her second long <lb/>
step toward freedom!"</p>
<p>Catherine started (and so did I); then she gazed <lb/>
long at Joan like one in a trance, murmuring "four <lb/>
days&#x2014;four days," as if to herself and uncon- <lb/>
sciously. Finally she asked, in a low voice that <lb/>
had something of awe in it:</p>
<p>"Joan, tell me&#x2014;how is it that you know that? <lb/>
For you do know it, I think."</p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>"Yes," said Joan, dreamily, "I know&#x2014;I know. <lb/>
I shall strike&#x2014;and strike again. And before the <lb/>
fourth day is finished I shall strike yet again." She <lb/>
became silent. We sat wondering and still. This <lb/>
was for a whole minute, she looking at the floor and <lb/>
her lips moving but uttering nothing. Then came <lb/>
these words, but hardly audible: "And in a thou- <lb/>
sand years the English power in France will not rise <lb/>
up from that blow."</p>
<p>It made my flesh creep. It was uncanny. She <lb/>
was in a trance again&#x2014;I could see it&#x2014;just as she <lb/>
was that day in the pastures of Domremy when she <lb/>
prophesied about us boys in the war and afterward <lb/>
did not know that she had done it. She was not <lb/>
conscious now; but Catherine did not know that, <lb/>
and so she said, in a happy voice:</p>
<p>"Oh, I believe it, I believe it, and I am so glad! <lb/>
Then you will come back and bide with us all your <lb/>
life long, and we will love you so, and so honor <lb/>
you!"</p>
<p>A scarcely perceptible spasm flitted across Joan's <lb/>
face, and the dreamy voice muttered:</p>
<p>"Before two years are sped I shall die a cruel <lb/>
death!"</p>
<p>I sprang forward with a warning hand up. That <lb/>
is why Catherine did not scream. She was going <lb/>
to do that&#x2014;I saw it plainly. Then I whispered her <lb/>
to slip out of the place, and say nothing of what <lb/>
had happened. I said Joan was asleep&#x2014;asleep and <lb/>
dreaming. Catherine whispered back, and said:</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>"Oh, I am so grateful that it is only a <lb/>
dream! It sounded like prophecy." And she was <lb/>
gone.</p>
<p><i>Like</i> prophecy! I knew it <i>was</i> prophecy; and I <lb/>
sat down crying, as knowing we should lose her. <lb/>
Soon she started, shivering slightly, and came to <lb/>
herself, and looked around and saw me crying there, <lb/>
and jumped out of her chair and ran to me all in a <lb/>
whirl of sympathy and compassion, and put her <lb/>
hand on my head, and said:</p>
<p>"My poor boy! What is it? Look up and tell <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>I had to tell her a lie; I grieved to do it, but <lb/>
there was no other way. I picked up an old letter <lb/>
from my table, written by Heaven knows who, about <lb/>
some matter Heaven knows what, and told her I had <lb/>
just gotten it from P&#x00E8;re Fronte, and that in it it said <lb/>
the children's Fairy Tree had been chopped down <lb/>
by some miscreant or other, and&#x2014;</p>
<p>I got no further. She snatched the letter from <lb/>
my hand and searched it up and down and all over, <lb/>
turning it this way and that, and sobbing great sobs, <lb/>
and the tears flowing down her cheeks, and ejaculat- <lb/>
ing all the time, "Oh, cruel, cruel! how could any be <lb/>
so heartless? Ah, poor Arbre F&#x00E9;e de Bourlemont <lb/>
gone&#x2014;and we children loved it so! Show me the <lb/>
place where it says it!"</p>
<p>And I, still lying, showed her the pretended fatal <lb/>
words on the pretended fatal page, and she gazed at <lb/>
them through her tears, and said she could see her- <lb/>
<pb n="11"/>
self that they were hateful, ugly words&#x2014;they "had <lb/>
the very look of it."</p>
<p>Then we heard a strong voice down the corridor <lb/>
announcing:</p>
<p>"His Majesty's messenger&#x2014;with dispatches for <lb/>
her Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of the <lb/>
armies of France!"</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXIX">
<pb n="12"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXIX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>I <i>knew</i></smcap> <i>she had seen the vision of the Tree</i>. But <lb/>
when? I could not know. Doubtless before <lb/>
she had lately told the King to use her, for that she <lb/>
had but one year left to work in. It had not oc- <lb/>
curred to me at the time, but the conviction came <lb/>
upon me now that at that time she had already seen <lb/>
the Tree. It had brought her a welcome message; <lb/>
that was plain, otherwise she could not have been so <lb/>
joyous and light-hearted as she had been these latter <lb/>
days. The death-warning had nothing dismal about <lb/>
it for her; no, it was remission of exile, it was leave <lb/>
to come home.</p>
<p>Yes, she had seen the Tree. No one had taken <lb/>
the prophecy to heart which she made to the King; <lb/>
and for a good reason, no doubt; no one <i>wanted</i> to <lb/>
take it to heart; all wanted to banish it away and <lb/>
forget it. And all had succeeded, and would go on <lb/>
to the end placid and comfortable. All but me <lb/>
alone. I must carry my awful secret without any to <lb/>
help me. A heavy load, a bitter burden; and would <lb/>
cost me a daily heart-break. She was to die; and <lb/>
so soon. I had never dreamed of that. How could <lb/>
I, and she so strong and fresh and young, and every <lb/>
<pb n="13"/>
day earning a new right to a peaceful and honored <lb/>
old age? For at that time I thought old age valu- <lb/>
able. I do not know why, but I thought so. All <lb/>
young people think it, I believe, they being ignorant <lb/>
and full of superstitions. She had seen the Tree. <lb/>
All that miserable night those ancient verses went <lb/>
floating back and forth through my brain: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And when in exile wand'ring, we</l>
<l>Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,</l>
<l rend="indent">Oh, rise upon our sight!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>But at dawn the bugles and the drums burst <lb/>
through the dreamy hush of the morning, and it was <lb/>
turn out all! mount and ride. For there was red <lb/>
work to be done.</p>
<p>We marched to Meung without halting. There <lb/>
we carried the bridge by assault, and left a force to <lb/>
hold it, the rest of the army marching away next <lb/>
morning toward Beaugency, where the lion Talbot, <lb/>
the terror of the French, was in command. When <lb/>
we arrived at that place, the English retired into the <lb/>
castle and we sat down in the abandoned town.</p>
<p>Talbot was not at the moment present in person, <lb/>
for he had gone away to watch for and welcome <lb/>
Fastolfe and his re-enforcement of five thousand <lb/>
men.</p>
<p>Joan placed her batteries and bombarded the <lb/>
castle till night. Then some news came: Riche- <lb/>
mont, Constable of France, this long time in dis- <lb/>
grace with the King, largely because of the evil <lb/>
machinations of La Tremouille and his party, was <lb/>
<pb n="14"/>
approaching with a large body of men to offer his <lb/>
services to Joan&#x2014;and very much she needed them, <lb/>
now that Fastolfe was so close by. Richemont had <lb/>
wanted to join us before, when we first marched on <lb/>
Orleans; but the foolish King, slave of those paltry <lb/>
advisers of his, warned him to keep his distance and <lb/>
refused all reconciliation with him.</p>
<p>I go into these details because they are important. <lb/>
Important because they lead up to the exhibition of <lb/>
a new gift in Joan's extraordinary mental make-up <lb/>
&#x2014;statesmanship. It is a sufficiently strange thing <lb/>
to find that great quality in an ignorant country girl <lb/>
of seventeen and a half, but she had it.</p>
<p>Joan was for receiving Richemont cordially, and <lb/>
so was La Hire and the two young Lavals and <lb/>
other chiefs, but the Lieutenant-General, D'Alen&#x00E7;on, <lb/>
strenuously and stubbornly opposed it. He said he <lb/>
had absolute orders from the King to deny and defy <lb/>
Richemont, and that if they were overridden he <lb/>
would leave the army. This would have been a <lb/>
heavy disaster, indeed. But Joan set herself the <lb/>
task of persuading him that the salvation of France <lb/>
took precedence of all minor things&#x2014;even the com- <lb/>
mands of a sceptred ass; and she accomplished it. <lb/>
She persuaded him to disobey the King in the <lb/>
interest of the nation, and to be reconciled to Count <lb/>
Richemont and welcome him. That was statesman- <lb/>
ship; and of the highest and soundest sort. What- <lb/>
ever thing men call great, look for it in Joan of Arc, <lb/>
and there you will find it.</p>

<head>JOAN AND THE WOUNDED ENGLISH SOLDIER</head>
</figure>
<pb/>
<pb n="15"/>
<p>In the early morning, June 17th, the scouts re- <lb/>
ported the approach of Talbot and Fastolfe with <lb/>
Fastolfe's succoring force. Then the drums beat to <lb/>
arms; and we set forth to meet the English, leaving <lb/>
Richemont and his troops behind to watch the castle <lb/>
of Beaugency and keep its garrison at home. By <lb/>
and by we came in sight of the enemy. Fastolfe <lb/>
had tried to convince Talbot that it would be wisest <lb/>
to retreat and not risk a battle with Joan at this <lb/>
time, but distribute the new levies among the Eng- <lb/>
lish strongholds of the Loire, thus securing them <lb/>
against capture; then be patient and wait&#x2014;wait for <lb/>
more levies from Paris; let Joan exhaust her army <lb/>
with fruitless daily skirmishing; then at the right <lb/>
time fall upon her in resistless mass and annihilate <lb/>
her. He was a wise old experienced general, was <lb/>
Fastolfe. But that fierce Talbot would hear of no <lb/>
delay. He was in a rage over the punishment which <lb/>
the Maid had inflicted upon him at Orleans and <lb/>
since, and he swore by God and Saint George that <lb/>
he would have it out with her if he had to fight her <lb/>
all alone. So Fastolfe yielded, though he said they <lb/>
were now risking the loss of everything which the <lb/>
English had gained by so many years' work and so <lb/>
many hard knocks.</p>
<p>The enemy had taken up a strong position, and <lb/>
were waiting, in order of battle, with their archers to <lb/>
the front and a stockade before them.</p>
<p>Night was coming on. A messenger came from <lb/>
the English with a rude defiance and an offer of <lb/>
<pb n="16"/>
battle. But Joan's dignity was not ruffled, her bear- <lb/>
ing was not discomposed. She said to the herald:</p>
<p>"Go back and say it is too late to meet to-night; <lb/>
but to-morrow, please God and our Lady, we will <lb/>
come to close quarters."</p>
<p>The night fell dark and rainy. It was that sort of <lb/>
light steady rain which falls so softly and brings to <lb/>
one's spirit such serenity and peace. About ten <lb/>
o'clock D'Alen&#x00E7;on, the Bastard of Orleans, La Hire, <lb/>
Pothon of Saintrailles, and two or three other gen- <lb/>
erals came to our headquarters tent, and sat down <lb/>
to discuss matters with Joan. Some thought it was <lb/>
a pity that Joan had declined battle, some thought <lb/>
not. Then Pothon asked her why she had declined <lb/>
it. She said:</p>
<p>"There was more than one reason. These Eng- <lb/>
lish are ours&#x2014;they cannot get away from us. <lb/>
Wherefore there is no need to take risks, as at other <lb/>
times. The day was far spent. It is good to have <lb/>
much time and the fair light of day when one's <lb/>
force is in a weakened state&#x2014;nine hundred of us <lb/>
yonder keeping the bridge of Meung under the <lb/>
Marshal de Rais, fifteen hundred with the Constable <lb/>
of France keeping the bridge and watching the castle <lb/>
of Beaugency."</p>
<p>Dunois said:</p>
<p>"I grieve for this depletion, Excellency, but it <lb/>
cannot be helped. And the case will be the same <lb/>
the morrow, as to that."</p>
<p>Joan was walking up and down just then. She <lb/>
<pb n="17"/>
laughed her affectionate, comrady laugh, and stop- <lb/>
ping before that old war-tiger she put her small <lb/>
hand above his head and touched one of his plumes, <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"Now tell me, wise man, which feather is it that <lb/>
I touch?"</p>
<p>"In sooth, Excellency, that I cannot."</p>
<p>"Name of God, Bastard, Bastard! you cannot <lb/>
tell me this small thing, yet are bold to name a <lb/>
large one&#x2014;telling us what is in the stomach of the <lb/>
unborn morrow: that we shall not have those men. <lb/>
Now it is my thought that they will be with us."</p>
<p>That made a stir. All wanted to know why she <lb/>
thought that. But La Hire took the word and said:</p>
<p>"Let be. If she thinks it, that is enough. It <lb/>
will happen."</p>
<p>Then Pothon of Saintrailles said:</p>
<p>"There were other reasons for declining battle, <lb/>
according to the saying of your Excellency?"</p>
<p>"Yes. One was that we being weak and the day <lb/>
far gone, the battle might not be decisive. When <lb/>
it is fought it <i>must</i> be decisive. And shall be."</p>
<p>"God grant it, and amen. There were still other <lb/>
reasons?"</p>
<p>"One other&#x2014;yes." She hesitated a moment, <lb/>
then said: "This was not the day. To-morrow is <lb/>
the day. It is so written."</p>
<p>They were going to assail her with eager question- <lb/>
ings, but she put up her hand and prevented them. <lb/>
Then she said:</p>
<pb n="18"/>
<p>"It will be the most noble and beneficent victory <lb/>
that God has vouchsafed to France at any time. I <lb/>
pray you question me not as to whence or how I <lb/>
know this thing, but be content that it is so."</p>
<p>There was pleasure in every face, and conviction <lb/>
and high confidence. A murmur of conversation <lb/>
broke out, but was interrupted by a messenger from <lb/>
the outposts who brought news&#x2014;namely, that for <lb/>
an hour there had been stir and movement in the <lb/>
English camp of a sort unusual at such a time and <lb/>
with a resting army, he said. Spies had been sent <lb/>
under cover of the rain and darkness to inquire into <lb/>
it. They had just come back and reported that <lb/>
large bodies of men had been dimly made out who <lb/>
were slipping stealthily away in the direction of <lb/>
Meung.</p>
<p>The generals were very much surprised, as any <lb/>
might tell from their faces.</p>
<p>"It is a retreat," said Joan.</p>
<p>"It has that look," said D'Alen&#x00E7;on.</p>
<p>"It certainly has," observed the Bastard and La <lb/>
Hire.</p>
<p>"It was not to be expected," said Louis de Bour- <lb/>
bon, "but one can divine the purpose of it."</p>
<p>"Yes," responded Joan. "Talbot has reflected. <lb/>
His rash brain has cooled. He thinks to take the <lb/>
bridge of Meung and escape to the other side of the <lb/>
river. He knows that this leaves his garrison of <lb/>
Beaugency at the mercy of fortune, to escape our <lb/>
hands if it can; but there is no other course if he <lb/>
<pb n="19"/>
would avoid this battle, and that he also knows. <lb/>
But he shall not get the bridge. We will see to <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>"Yes," said D'Alen&#x00E7;on, "we must follow him, <lb/>
and take care of that matter. What of Beau- <lb/>
gency?"</p>
<p>"Leave Beaugency to me, gentle duke; I will <lb/>
have it in two hours, and at no cost of blood."</p>
<p>"It is true, Excellency. You will but need to <lb/>
deliver this news there and receive the surrender."</p>
<p>"Yes. And I will be with you at Meung with <lb/>
the dawn, fetching the Constable and his fifteen <lb/>
hundred; and when Talbot knows that Beaugency <lb/>
has fallen it will have an effect upon him."</p>
<p>"By the mass, yes!" cried La Hire. "He will <lb/>
join his Meung garrison to his army and break for <lb/>
Paris. Then we shall have our bridge force with us <lb/>
again, along with our Beaugency-watchers, and be <lb/>
stronger for our great day's work by four-and- <lb/>
twenty hundred able soldiers, as was here promised <lb/>
within the hour. Verily this Englishman is doing <lb/>
our errands for us and saving us much blood <lb/>
and trouble. Orders, Excellency&#x2014;give us our <lb/>
orders!"</p>
<p>"They are simple. Let the men rest three hours <lb/>
longer. At one o'clock the advance-guard will <lb/>
march, under your command, with Pothon of Sain- <lb/>
trailles as second; the second division will follow at <lb/>
two under the Lieutenant-General. Keep well in the <lb/>
rear of the enemy, and see to it that you avoid an <lb/>
<pb n="20"/>
engagement. I will ride under guard to Beaugency <lb/>
and make so quick work there that I and the Con- <lb/>
stable of France will join you before dawn with his <lb/>
men."</p>
<p>She kept her word. Her guard mounted and we <lb/>
rode off through the puttering rain, taking with us a <lb/>
captured English officer to confirm Joan's news. <lb/>
We soon covered the journey and summoned the <lb/>
castle. Richard Gu&#x00E9;tin, Talbot's lieutenant, being <lb/>
convinced that he and his five hundred men were <lb/>
left helpless, conceded that it would be useless <lb/>
to try to hold out. He could not expect easy <lb/>
terms, yet Joan granted them nevertheless. His <lb/>
garrison could keep their horses and arms, and <lb/>
carry away property to the value of a silver mark <lb/>
per man. They could go whither they pleased, but <lb/>
must not take arms against France again under ten <lb/>
days.</p>
<p>Before dawn we were with our army again, and <lb/>
with us the Constable and nearly all his men, for we <lb/>
left only a small garrison in Beaugency castle. We <lb/>
heard the dull booming of cannon to the front, and <lb/>
knew that Talbot was beginning his attack on the <lb/>
bridge. But some time before it was yet light the <lb/>
sound ceased and we heard it no more.</p>
<p>Gu&#x00E9;tin had sent a messenger through our lines <lb/>
under a safe-conduct given by Joan, to tell Talbot <lb/>
of the surrender. Of course this poursuivant had <lb/>
arrived ahead of us. Talbot had held it wisdom to <lb/>
turn now and retreat upon Paris. When daylight <lb/>
<pb n="21"/>
came he had disappeared; and with him Lord Scales <lb/>
and the garrison of Meung.</p>
<p>What a harvest of English strongholds we had <lb/>
reaped in those three days!&#x2014;strongholds which <lb/>
had defied France with quite cool confidence and <lb/>
plenty of it until we came.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>When</smcap> the morning broke at last on that forever <lb/>
memorable 18th of June, there was no enemy <lb/>
discoverable anywhere, as I have said. But that <lb/>
did not trouble me. I knew we should find him, <lb/>
and that we should strike him; strike him the <lb/>
promised blow&#x2014;the one from which the English <lb/>
power in France would not rise up in a thousand <lb/>
years, as Joan had said in her trance.</p>
<p>The enemy had plunged into the wide plains of <lb/>
La Beauce&#x2014;a roadless waste covered with bushes, <lb/>
with here and there bodies of forest trees&#x2014;a region <lb/>
where an army would be hidden from view in a very <lb/>
little while. We found the trail in the soft wet earth <lb/>
and followed it. It indicated an orderly march; <lb/>
no confusion, no panic.</p>
<p>But we had to be cautious. In such a piece of <lb/>
country we could walk into an ambush without any <lb/>
trouble. Therefore Joan sent bodies of cavalry <lb/>
ahead under La Hire, Pothon, and other captains, <lb/>
to feel the way. Some of the other officers began <lb/>
to show uneasiness; this sort of hide-and-go-seek <lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
business troubled them and made their confidence a <lb/>
little shaky. Joan divined their state of mind and <lb/>
cried out impetuously:</p>
<p>"Name of God, what would you? We must <lb/>
smite these English, and we will. They shall not <lb/>
escape us. Though they were hung to the clouds <lb/>
we would get them!"</p>
<p>By and by we were nearing Patay; it was about a <lb/>
league away. Now at this time our reconnoissance, <lb/>
feeling its way in the bush, frightened a deer, and it <lb/>
went bounding away and was out of sight in a mo- <lb/>
ment. Then hardly a minute later a dull great <lb/>
shout went up in the distance toward Patay. It was <lb/>
the English soldiery. They had been shut up in <lb/>
garrison so long on mouldy food that they could not <lb/>
keep their delight to themselves when this fine fresh <lb/>
meat came springing into their midst. Poor creature, <lb/>
it had wrought damage to a nation which loved it <lb/>
well. For the French knew where the English were <lb/>
now, whereas the English had no suspicion of where <lb/>
the French were.</p>
<p>La Hire halted where he was, and sent back the <lb/>
tidings. Joan was radiant with joy. The Duke <lb/>
d'Alen&#x00E7;on said to her:</p>
<p>"Very well, we have found them; shall we fight <lb/>
them?"</p>
<p>"Have you good spurs, prince?"</p>
<p>"Why? Will they make us run away?"</p>
<p>"Nenni, en nom de Dieu! These English are <lb/>
ours&#x2014;they are lost. They will fly. Who over- <lb/>
<pb n="24"/>
takes them will need good spurs. Forward&#x2014;close <lb/>
up!"</p>
<p>By the time we had come up with La Hire the <lb/>
English had discovered our presence. Talbot's <lb/>
force was marching in three bodies. First his <lb/>
advance-guard; then his artillery; then his battle <lb/>
corps a good way in the rear. He was now out of <lb/>
the bush and in a fair open country. He at once <lb/>
posted his artillery, his advance-guard, and five <lb/>
hundred picked archers along some hedges where <lb/>
the French would be obliged to pass, and hoped to <lb/>
hold this position till his battle corps could come <lb/>
up. Sir John Fastolfe urged the battle corps into a <lb/>
gallop. Joan saw her opportunity and ordered La <lb/>
Hire to advance&#x2014;which La Hire promptly did, <lb/>
launching his wild riders like a storm-wind, his cus- <lb/>
tomary fashion.</p>
<p>The Duke and the Bastard wanted to follow, but <lb/>
Joan said:</p>
<p>"Not yet&#x2014;wait."</p>
<p>So they waited&#x2014;impatiently, and fidgeting in <lb/>
their saddles. But she was steady&#x2014;gazing straight <lb/>
before her, measuring, weighing, calculating&#x2014;by <lb/>
shades, minutes, fractions of minutes, seconds&#x2014; <lb/>
with all her great soul present, in eye, and set of <lb/>
head, and noble pose of body&#x2014;but patient, steady, <lb/>
master of herself&#x2014;master of herself and of the <lb/>
situation.</p>
<p>And yonder, receding, receding, plumes lifting <lb/>
and falling, lifting and falling, streamed the thunder- <lb/>
<pb n="25"/>
ing charge of La Hire's godless crew, La Hire's <lb/>
great figure dominating it and his sword stretched <lb/>
aloft like a flagstaff.</p>
<p>"Oh, Satan and his Hellions, see them go!" <lb/>
Somebody muttered it in deep admiration.</p>
<p>And now he was closing up&#x2014;closing up on <lb/>
Fastolfe's rushing corps.</p>
<p>And now he struck it&#x2014;struck it hard, and broke <lb/>
its order. It lifted the duke and the Bastard in <lb/>
their saddles to see it; and they turned, trembling <lb/>
with excitement, to Joan, saying:</p>
<p>"<i>Now!</i>"</p>
<p>But she put up her hand, still gazing, weighing, <lb/>
calculating, and said again:</p>
<p>"Wait&#x2014;not yet."</p>
<p>Fastolfe's hard-driven battle corps raged on like <lb/>
an avalanche toward the waiting advance-guard. <lb/>
Suddenly these conceived the idea that it was flying <lb/>
in panic before Joan; and so in that instant it broke <lb/>
and swarmed away in a mad panic itself, with Talbot <lb/>
storming and cursing after it.</p>
<p>Now was the golden time. Joan drove her spurs <lb/>
home and waved the advance with her sword. <lb/>
"Follow me!" she cried, and bent her head to her <lb/>
horse's neck and sped away like the wind!</p>
<p>We swept down into the confusion of that flying <lb/>
rout, and for three long hours we cut and hacked <lb/>
and stabbed. At last the bugles sang "Halt!"</p>
<p>The Battle of Patay was won.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc dismounted, and stood surveying <lb/>
<pb n="26"/>
that awful field, lost in thought. Presently she <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"The praise is to God. He has smitten with a <lb/>
heavy hand this day." After a little she lifted her <lb/>
face, and looking afar off, said, with the manner of <lb/>
one who is thinking aloud, "In a thousand years&#x2014; <lb/>
a thousand years&#x2014;the English power in France will <lb/>
not rise up from this blow." She stood again a <lb/>
time thinking, then she turned toward her grouped <lb/>
generals, and there was a glory in her face and a <lb/>
noble light in her eye; and she said:</p>
<p>"Oh, friends, friends, do you know?&#x2014;do you <lb/>
comprehend? <i>France is on the way to be free!</i>"</p>
<p>"And had never been, but for Joan of Arc!" <lb/>
said La Hire, passing before her and bowing low, <lb/>
the others following and doing likewise; he mutter- <lb/>
ing as he went, "I will say it though I be damned <lb/>
for it." Then battalion after battalion of our vic- <lb/>
torious army swung by, wildly cheering. And they <lb/>
shouted "Live forever, Maid of Orleans, live for- <lb/>
ever!" while Joan, smiling, stood at the salute with <lb/>
her sword.</p>
<p>This was not the last time I saw the Maid of <lb/>
Orleans on the red field of Patay. Toward the end <lb/>
of the day I came upon her where the dead and <lb/>
dying lay stretched all about in heaps and winrows; <lb/>
our men had mortally wounded an English prisoner <lb/>
who was too poor to pay a ransom, and from a dis- <lb/>
tance she had seen that cruel thing done; and had <lb/>
galloped to the place and sent for a priest, and now <lb/>
<pb n="27"/>
she was holding the head of her dying enemy in her <lb/>
lap, and easing him to his death with comforting <lb/>
soft words, just as his sister might have done; and <lb/>
the womanly tears running down her face all the <lb/>
time.<ref target="n1">*</ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Lord Ronald Gower (<i>Joan of Arc</i>, p. 82) says: "Michelet dis- <lb/>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXXI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Joan</smcap> had said true: France was on the way to <lb/>
be free.</p>
<p>The war called the Hundred Years' War was very <lb/>
sick to-day. Sick on its English side&#x2014;for the very <lb/>
first time since its birth, ninety-one years gone by.</p>
<p>Shall we judge battles by the numbers killed and <lb/>
the ruin wrought? Or shall we not rather judge <lb/>
them by the results which flowed from them? Any <lb/>
one will say that a battle is only truly great or small <lb/>
according to its results. Yes, any one will grant <lb/>
that, for it is the truth.</p>
<p>Judged by results, Patay's place is with the few <lb/>
supremely great and imposing battles that have been <lb/>
fought since the peoples of the world first resorted to <lb/>
arms for the settlement of their quarrels. So <lb/>
judged, it is even possible that Patay has no peer <lb/>
among that few just mentioned, but stands alone, as <lb/>
the supremest of historic conflicts. For when it <lb/>
began France lay gasping out the remnant of an <lb/>
exhausted life, her case wholly hopeless in the view of <lb/>
all political physicians; when it ended, three hours <lb/>
later, she was convalescent. Convalescent, and noth- <lb/>
<pb n="29"/>
ing requisite but time and ordinary nursing to bring <lb/>
her back to perfect health. The dullest physician <lb/>
of them all could see this, and there was none to <lb/>
deny it.</p>
<p>Many death-sick nations have reached convales- <lb/>
cence through a series of battles, a procession of <lb/>
battles, a weary tale of wasting conflicts stretching <lb/>
over years, but only one has reached it in a single <lb/>
day and by a single battle. That nation is France, <lb/>
and that battle Patay.</p>
<p>Remember it and be proud of it; for you are <lb/>
French, and it is the stateliest fact in the long annals <lb/>
of your country. There it stands, with its head in <lb/>
the clouds! And when you grow up you will go on <lb/>
pilgrimage to the field of Patay, and stand uncov- <lb/>
ered in the presence of&#x2014;what? A monument with <lb/>
<i>its</i> head in the clouds? Yes. For all nations in all <lb/>
times have built monuments on their battlefields to <lb/>
keep green the memory of the perishable deed that <lb/>
was wrought there and of the perishable name of <lb/>
him who wrought it; and will France neglect Patay <lb/>
and Joan of Arc? Not for long. And will she <lb/>
build a monument scaled to their rank as compared <lb/>
with the world's other fields and heroes? Perhaps <lb/>
&#x2014;if there be room for it under the arch of the sky.</p>
<p>But let us look back a little, and consider certain <lb/>
strange and impressive facts. The Hundred Years' <lb/>
War began in 1337. It raged on and on, year after <lb/>
year and year after year; and at last England <lb/>
stretched France prone with that fearful blow at <lb/>
<pb n="30"/>
Cr&#x00E9;cy. But she rose and struggled on, year after <lb/>
year, and at last again she went down under another <lb/>
devastating blow&#x2014;Poitiers. She gathered her crip- <lb/>
pled strength once more, and the war raged on, <lb/>
and on, and still on, year after year, decade after <lb/>
decade. Children were born, grew up, married, <lb/>
died&#x2014;the war raged on; <i>their</i> children in turn grew <lb/>
up, married, died&#x2014;the war raged on; <i>their</i> chil- <lb/>
dren, growing, saw France struck down again; this <lb/>
time under the incredible disaster of Agincourt&#x2014; <lb/>
and still the war raged on, year after year, and in <lb/>
time <i>these</i> children married in their turn.</p>
<p>France was a wreck, a ruin, a desolation. The <lb/>
half of it belonged to England, with none to dispute <lb/>
or deny the truth; the other half belonged to <lb/>
nobody&#x2014;in three months would be flying the <lb/>
English flag; the French King was making ready <lb/>
to throw away his crown and flee beyond the seas.</p>
<p>Now came the ignorant country maid out of her <lb/>
remote village and confronted this hoary war, this <lb/>
all-consuming conflagration that had swept the land <lb/>
for three generations. Then began the briefest and <lb/>
most amazing campaign that is recorded in history. <lb/>
In seven weeks it was finished. In seven weeks she <lb/>
hopelessly crippled that gigantic war that was ninety- <lb/>
one years old. At Orleans she struck it a stagger- <lb/>
ing blow; on the field of Patay she broke its back.</p>
<p>Think of it. Yes, one can do that; but <i>under- <lb/>
stand</i> it? Ah, that is another matter; none will <lb/>
ever be able to comprehend that stupefying marvel.</p>
<pb n="31"/>
<p>Seven weeks&#x2014;with here and there a little blood- <lb/>
shed. Perhaps the most of it, in any single fight, <lb/>
at Patay, where the English began six thousand <lb/>
strong and left two thousand dead upon the field. <lb/>
It is said and believed that in three battles alone&#x2014; <lb/>
Cr&#x00E9;cy, Poitiers, and Agincourt&#x2014;near a hundred <lb/>
thousand Frenchmen fell, without counting the <lb/>
thousand other fights of that long war. The dead <lb/>
of that war make a mournful long list&#x2014;an inter- <lb/>
minable list. Of men slain in the field the count <lb/>
goes by tens of thousands; of innocent women and <lb/>
children slain by bitter hardship and hunger it goes <lb/>
by that appalling term, millions.</p>
<p>It was an ogre, that war; an ogre that went about <lb/>
for near a hundred years, crunching men and drip- <lb/>
ping blood from his jaws. And with her little hand <lb/>
that child of seventeen struck him down; and yon- <lb/>
der he lies stretched on the field of Patay, and will <lb/>
not get up any more while this old world lasts.</p>
</div2>

<pb n="32"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXXII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> great news of Patay was carried over the <lb/>
whole of France in twenty hours, people said. <lb/>
I do not know as to that; but one thing is sure, <lb/>
anyway: the moment a man got it he flew shouting <lb/>
and glorifying God and told his neighbor; and that <lb/>
neighbor flew with it to the next homestead; and so <lb/>
on and so on without resting the word traveled; and <lb/>
when a man got it in the night, at what hour soever, <lb/>
he jumped out of his bed and bore the blessed mes- <lb/>
sage along. And the joy that went with it was like <lb/>
the light that flows across the land when an eclipse <lb/>
is receding from the face of the sun; and, indeed, <lb/>
you may say that France had lain in an eclipse this <lb/>
long time; yes, buried in a black gloom which these <lb/>
beneficent tidings were sweeping away now before <lb/>
the onrush of their white splendor.</p>
<p>The news beat the flying enemy to Yeuville, and <lb/>
the town rose against its English masters and shut <lb/>
the gates against their brethren. It flew to Mont <lb/>
Pipeau, to Saint Simon, and to this, that, and the <lb/>
other English fortress; and straightway the garrison <lb/>
applied the torch and took to the fields and the <lb/>
<pb n="33"/>
woods. A detachment of our army occupied Meung <lb/>
and pillaged it.</p>
<p>When we reached Orleans that town was as much <lb/>
as fifty times insaner with joy than we had ever seen <lb/>
it before&#x2014;which is saying much. Night had just <lb/>
fallen, and the illuminations were on so wonderful a <lb/>
scale that we seemed to plow through seas of fire; <lb/>
and as to the noise&#x2014;the hoarse cheering of the <lb/>
multitude, the thundering of cannon, the clash of <lb/>
bells&#x2014;indeed, there was never anything like it. <lb/>
And everywhere rose a new cry that burst upon us <lb/>
like a storm when the column entered the gates, and <lb/>
nevermore ceased: "Welcome to Joan of Arc&#x2014; <lb/>
way for the <smcap>Saviour of France</smcap>!" And there <lb/>
was another cry: "Cr&#x00E9;cy is avenged! Poitiers is <lb/>
avenged! Agincourt is avenged!&#x2014;Patay shall live <lb/>
forever!"</p>
<p>Mad? Why, you never could imagine it in the <lb/>
world. The prisoners were in the center of the <lb/>
column. When that came along and the people <lb/>
caught sight of their masterful old enemy Talbot, <lb/>
that had made them dance so long to his grim war- <lb/>
music, you may imagine what the uproar was like if <lb/>
you can, for I cannot describe it. They were so <lb/>
glad to see him that presently they wanted to have <lb/>
him out and hang him; so Joan had him brought <lb/>
up to the front to ride in her protection. They <lb/>
made a striking pair.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXXIII">
<pb n="34"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXXIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Yes</smcap>, Orleans was in a delirium of felicity. She <lb/>
invited the King, and made sumptuous prepa- <lb/>
rations to receive him, but&#x2014;he didn't come. He <lb/>
was simply a serf at that time, and La Tremouille <lb/>
was his master. Master and serf were visiting <lb/>
together at the master's castle of Sully-sur-Loire.</p>
<p>At Beaugency Joan had engaged to bring about a <lb/>
reconciliation between the Constable Richemont and <lb/>
the King. She took Richemont to Sully-sur-Loire <lb/>
and made her promise good.</p>
<p>The great deeds of Joan of Arc are five:</p>
<list>
<item>1. The Raising of the Siege.</item>
<item>2. The Victory of Patay.</item>
<item>3. The Reconciliation at Sully-sur-Loire.</item>
<item>4. The Coronation of the King.</item>
<item>5. The Bloodless March.</item>
</list>
<p>We shall come to the Bloodless March presently <lb/>
(and the Coronation). It was the victorious long <lb/>
march which Joan made through the enemy's coun- <lb/>
try from Gien to Rheims, and thence to the gates of <lb/>
Paris, capturing every English town and fortress <lb/>
that barred the road, from the beginning of the <lb/>
<pb n="35"/>
journey to the end of it; and this by the mere force <lb/>
of her name, and without shedding a drop of blood <lb/>
&#x2014;perhaps the most extraordinary campaign in this <lb/>
regard in history&#x2014;this is the most glorious of her <lb/>
military exploits.</p>
<p>The Reconciliation was one of Joan's most im- <lb/>
portant achievements. No one else could have ac- <lb/>
complished it; and, in fact, no one else of high <lb/>
consequence had any disposition to try. In brains, <lb/>
in scientific warfare, and in statesmanship the Con- <lb/>
stable Richemont was the ablest man in France. <lb/>
His loyalty was sincere; his probity was above sus- <lb/>
picion&#x2014;(and it made him sufficiently conspicuous <lb/>
in that trivial and conscienceless Court).</p>
<p>In restoring Richemont to France, Joan made <lb/>
thoroughly secure the successful completion of the <lb/>
great work which she had begun. She had never <lb/>
seen Richemont until he came to her with his little <lb/>
army. Was it not wonderful that at a glance she <lb/>
should know him for the one man who could finish <lb/>
and perfect her work and establish it in perpetuity? <lb/>
How was it that that child was able to do this? It <lb/>
was because she had the "seeing eye," as one of <lb/>
our knights had once said. Yes, she had that great <lb/>
gift&#x2014;almost the highest and rarest that has been <lb/>
granted to man. Nothing of an extraordinary sort <lb/>
was still to be done, yet the remaining work could <lb/>
not safely be left to the King's idiots; for it would <lb/>
require wise statesmanship and long and patient <lb/>
though desultory hammering of the enemy. Now <lb/>
<pb n="36"/>
and then, for a quarter of a century yet, there would <lb/>
be a little fighting to do, and a handy man could <lb/>
carry that on with small disturbance to the rest of <lb/>
the country; and little by little, and with progres- <lb/>
sive certainty, the English would disappear from <lb/>
France.</p>
<p>And that happened. Under the influence of <lb/>
Richemont the King became at a later time a <lb/>
man&#x2014;a man, a king, a brave and capable and <lb/>
determined soldier. Within six years after Patay <lb/>
he was leading storming parties himself; fighting in <lb/>
fortress ditches up to his waist in water, and climb- <lb/>
ing scaling-ladders under a furious fire with a pluck <lb/>
that would have satisfied even Joan of Arc. In time <lb/>
he and Richemont cleared away all the English; <lb/>
even from regions where the people had been under <lb/>
their mastership for three hundred years. In such <lb/>
regions wise and careful work was necessary, for the <lb/>
English rule had been fair and kindly; and men who <lb/>
have been ruled in that way are not always anxious <lb/>
for a change.</p>
<p>Which of Joan's five chief deeds shall we call <lb/>
chiefest? It is my thought that each <i>in its turn</i> was <lb/>
that. This is saying that, taken as a whole, they <lb/>
<i>equalized</i> each other, and neither was then greater <lb/>
than its mate.</p>
<p>Do you perceive? Each was a stage in an ascent. <lb/>
To leave out one of them would defeat the journey; <lb/>
to achieve one of them at the wrong time and in the <lb/>
wrong place would have the same effect.</p>
<pb n="37"/>
<p>Consider the Coronation. As a masterpiece of <lb/>
diplomacy, where can you find its superior in our <lb/>
history? Did the King suspect its vast importance? <lb/>
No. Did his ministers? No. Did the astute Bed- <lb/>
ford, representative of the English crown? No. <lb/>
An advantage of incalculable importance was here <lb/>
under the eyes of the King and of Bedford; the <lb/>
King could get it by a bold stroke, Bedford could <lb/>
get it without an effort; but, being ignorant of its <lb/>
value, neither of them put forth his hand. Of all <lb/>
the wise people in high office in France, only one <lb/>
knew the priceless worth of this neglected prize&#x2014; <lb/>
the untaught child of seventeen, Joan of Arc&#x2014;and <lb/>
she had known it from the beginning, had spoken of <lb/>
it from the beginning as an essential detail of her <lb/>
mission.</p>
<p>How did she know it? It is simple: she was a <lb/>
peasant. That tells the whole story. She was of <lb/>
the people and knew the people; those others <lb/>
moved in a loftier sphere and knew nothing much <lb/>
about them. We make little account of that <lb/>
vague, formless, inert mass, that mighty underly- <lb/>
ing force which we call "the people"&#x2014;an epithet <lb/>
which carries contempt with it. It is a strange <lb/>
attitude; for at bottom we know that the throne <lb/>
which the people support stands, and that when <lb/>
that support is removed nothing in this world can <lb/>
save it.</p>
<p>Now, then, consider this fact, and observe its im- <lb/>
portance. Whatever the parish priest believes his <lb/>
<pb n="38"/>
flock believes; they love him, they revere him; he <lb/>
is their unfailing friend, their dauntless protector, <lb/>
their comforter in sorrow, their helper in their day <lb/>
of need; he has their whole confidence; what he <lb/>
tells them to do, that they will do, with a blind and <lb/>
affectionate obedience, let it cost what it may. Add <lb/>
these facts thoughtfully together, and what is the <lb/>
sum? This: <i>The parish priest governs the nation</i>. <lb/>
What is the King, then, if the parish priest with- <lb/>
draw his support and deny his authority? Merely <lb/>
a shadow and no King; let him resign.</p>
<p>Do you get that idea? Then let us proceed. A <lb/>
priest is consecrated to his office by the awful hand <lb/>
of God, laid upon him by his appointed represent- <lb/>
ative on earth. That consecration is final; nothing <lb/>
can undo it, nothing can remove it. Neither the <lb/>
Pope nor any other power can strip the priest of his <lb/>
office; God gave it, and it is forever sacred and <lb/>
secure. The dull parish knows all this. To priest <lb/>
and parish, whosoever is anointed of God bears an <lb/>
office whose authority can no longer be disputed or <lb/>
assailed. To the parish priest, and to his subjects <lb/>
the nation, an uncrowned king is a similitude of a <lb/>
person who has been named for holy orders but has <lb/>
not been consecrated; he has no office, he has not <lb/>
been ordained, another may be appointed in his <lb/>
place. In a word, an uncrowned king is a <i>doubtful</i> <lb/>
king; but if God appoint him and His servant the <lb/>
Bishop anoint him, the doubt is annihilated; the <lb/>
priest and the parish are his loyal subjects straight- <lb/>
<pb n="39"/>
way, and while he lives they will recognize no king <lb/>
but him.</p>
<p>To Joan of Arc the peasant girl, Charles VII. was <lb/>
no King until he was crowned; to her he was only <lb/>
the <foreign lang="fre"><i>Dauphin;</i></foreign> that is to say, the <i>heir</i>. If I have <lb/>
ever made her call him King, it was a mistake; she <lb/>
called him the Dauphin, and nothing else until after <lb/>
the Coronation. It shows you as in a mirror&#x2014;for <lb/>
Joan was a mirror in which the lowly hosts of France <lb/>
were clearly reflected&#x2014;that to all that vast under- <lb/>
lying force called "the people" he was no King <lb/>
but only Dauphin before his crowning, and was <lb/>
indisputably and irrevocably King <i>after</i> it.</p>
<p>Now you understand what a colossal move on the <lb/>
political chessboard the Coronation was. Bedford <lb/>
realized this by and by, and tried to patch up his <lb/>
mistake by crowning <i>his</i> King; but what good could <lb/>
that do? None in the world.</p>
<p>Speaking of chess, Joan's great acts may be <lb/>
likened to that game. Each move was made in its <lb/>
proper order, and it was great and effective because <lb/>
it <i>was</i> made in its proper order and not out of it. <lb/>
Each, at the time made, seemed the greatest move; <lb/>
but the final result made them all recognizable as <lb/>
equally essential and equally important. This is the <lb/>
game, as played:</p>
<list>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXXIV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> Campaign of the Loire had as good as <lb/>
opened the road to Rheims. There was no <lb/>
sufficient reason now why the Coronation should not <lb/>
take place. The Coronation would complete the <lb/>
mission which Joan had received from heaven, and <lb/>
then she would be forever done with war, and would <lb/>
fly home to her mother and her sheep, and never <lb/>
stir from the hearthstone and happiness any more. <lb/>
That was her dream; and she could not rest, she <lb/>
was so impatient to see it fulfilled. She became so <lb/>
possessed with this matter that I began to lose faith <lb/>
in her two prophecies of her early death&#x2014;and, of <lb/>
course, when I found that faith wavering I encour- <lb/>
aged it to waver all the more.</p>
<p>The King was afraid to start to Rheims, because <lb/>
the road was mile-posted with English fortresses, so <lb/>
to speak. Joan held them in light esteem and not <lb/>
things to be afraid of in the existing modified condi- <lb/>
tion of English confidence.</p>
<p>And she was right. As it turned out, the march <lb/>
to Rheims was nothing but a holiday excursion, <lb/>
Joan did not even take any artillery along, she was <lb/>
so sure it would not be necessary. We marched <lb/>
<pb n="42"/>
from Gien twelve thousand strong. This was the <lb/>
29th of June. The Maid rode by the side of the <lb/>
King; on his other side was the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on. <lb/>
After the duke followed three other princes of the <lb/>
blood. After these followed the Bastard of Orleans, <lb/>
the Marshal de Boussac, and the Admiral of France. <lb/>
After these came La Hire, Saintrailles, Tremouille, <lb/>
and a long procession of knights and nobles.</p>
<p>We rested three days before Auxerre. The city <lb/>
provisioned the army, and a deputation waited upon <lb/>
the King, but we did not enter the place.</p>
<p>Saint-Florentin opened its gates to the King.</p>
<p>On the 4th of July we reached Saint-Fal, and <lb/>
yonder lay Troyes before us&#x2014;a town which had a <lb/>
burning interest for us boys; for we remembered <lb/>
how seven years before, in the pastures of Dom- <lb/>
remy, the Sunflower came with his black flag and <lb/>
brought us the shameful news of the Treaty of <lb/>
Troyes&#x2014;that treaty which gave France to England, <lb/>
and a daughter of our royal line in marriage to the <lb/>
Butcher of Agincourt. That poor town was not to <lb/>
blame, of course; yet we flushed hot with that old <lb/>
memory, and hoped there would be a misunder- <lb/>
standing here, for we dearly wanted to storm the <lb/>
place and burn it. It was powerfully garrisoned by <lb/>
English and Burgundian soldiery, and was expect- <lb/>
ing re-enforcements from Paris. Before night we <lb/>
camped before its gates and made rough work with <lb/>
a sortie which marched out against us.</p>
<p>Joan summoned Troyes to surrender. Its com- <lb/>
<pb n="43"/>
mandant, seeing that she had no artillery, scoffed at <lb/>
the idea, and sent her a grossly insulting reply. <lb/>
Five days we consulted and negotiated. No result. <lb/>
The King was about to turn back now and give up. <lb/>
He was afraid to go on, leaving this strong place in <lb/>
his rear. Then La Hire put in a word, with a slap <lb/>
in it for some of his Majesty's advisers:</p>
<p>"The Maid of Orleans undertook this expedition <lb/>
of her own motion; and it is my mind that it is her <lb/>
judgment that should be followed here, and not <lb/>
that of any other, let him be of whatsoever breed <lb/>
and standing he may."</p>
<p>There was wisdom and righteousness in that. So <lb/>
the King sent for the Maid, and asked her how she <lb/>
thought the prospect looked. She said, without <lb/>
any tone of doubt or question in her voice:</p>
<p>"In three days' time the place is ours."</p>
<p>The smug Chancellor put in a word now:</p>
<p>"If we were sure of it we would wait here six <lb/>
days."</p>
<p>"Six days, forsooth! Name of God, man, we <lb/>
will enter the gates to-morrow!"</p>
<p>Then she mounted, and rode her lines, crying out:</p>
<p>"Make preparation&#x2014;to your work, friends, to <lb/>
your work! We assault at dawn!"</p>
<p>She worked hard that night; slaving away with <lb/>
her own hands like a common soldier. She ordered <lb/>
fascines and fagots to be prepared and thrown into <lb/>
the fosse, thereby to bridge it; and in this rough <lb/>
labor she took a man's share.</p>
<pb n="44"/>
<p>At dawn she took her place at the head of the <lb/>
storming force and the bugles blew the assault. At <lb/>
that moment a flag of truce was flung to the breeze <lb/>
from the walls, and Troyes surrendered without <lb/>
firing a shot.</p>
<p>The next day the King with Joan at his side and <lb/>
the Paladin bearing her banner entered the town in <lb/>
state at the head of the army. And a goodly army <lb/>
it was now, for it had been growing ever bigger and <lb/>
bigger from the first.</p>
<p>And now a curious thing happened. By the <lb/>
terms of the treaty made with the town the garrison <lb/>
of English and Burgundian soldiery were to be <lb/>
allowed to carry away their "goods" with them. <lb/>
This was well, for otherwise how would they buy <lb/>
the wherewithal to live? Very well; these people <lb/>
were all to go out by the one gate, and at the time <lb/>
set for them to depart we young fellows went to <lb/>
that gate, along with the Dwarf, to see the march- <lb/>
out. Presently here they came in an interminable <lb/>
file, the foot-soldiers in the lead. As they ap- <lb/>
proached one could see that each bore a burden of <lb/>
a bulk and weight to sorely tax his strength; and we <lb/>
said among ourselves, truly these folk are well off <lb/>
for poor common soldiers. When they were come <lb/>
nearer, what do you think? Every rascal of them <lb/>
had a French prisoner on his back! They were <lb/>
carrying away their "goods," you see&#x2014;their prop- <lb/>
erty&#x2014;strictly according to the permission granted <lb/>
by the treaty.</p>
<pb n="45"/>
<p>Now think how clever that was, how ingenious. <lb/>
What could a body say? what could a body do? <lb/>
For certainly these people were within their right. <lb/>
These prisoners were property; nobody could deny <lb/>
that. My dears, if those had been <i>English</i> cap- <lb/>
tives, conceive of the richness of that booty! For <lb/>
English prisoners had been scarce and precious for <lb/>
a hundred years; whereas it was a different matter <lb/>
with French prisoners. They had been over- <lb/>
abundant for a century. The possessor of a French <lb/>
prisoner did not hold him long for ransom, as a <lb/>
rule, but presently killed him to save the cost of his <lb/>
keep. This shows you how small was the value of <lb/>
such a possession in those times. When we took <lb/>
Troyes a calf was worth thirty francs, a sheep six- <lb/>
teen, a French prisoner eight. It was an enormous <lb/>
price for those other animals&#x2014;a price which natur- <lb/>
ally seems incredible to you. It was the war, you <lb/>
see. It worked two ways: it made meat dear and <lb/>
prisoners cheap.</p>
<p>Well, here were these poor Frenchmen being <lb/>
carried off. What could we do? Very little of a <lb/>
permanent sort, but we did what we could. We <lb/>
sent a messenger flying to Joan, and we and the <lb/>
French guards halted the procession for a parley&#x2014; <lb/>
to gain time, you see. A big Burgundian lost his <lb/>
temper and swore a great oath that none should stop <lb/>
<i>him;</i> he would go, and would take his prisoner with <lb/>
him. But we blocked him off, and he saw that he <lb/>
was mistaken about going&#x2014;he couldn't do it. He <lb/>
<pb n="46"/>
exploded into the maddest cursings and revilings, <lb/>
then, and, unlashing his prisoner from his back, stood <lb/>
him up, all bound and helpless; then drew his <lb/>
knife, and said to us with a light of sarcastic triumph <lb/>
in his eye:</p>
<p>"I may not carry him away, you say&#x2014;yet he is <lb/>
mine, none will dispute it. Since I may not convey <lb/>
him hence, this property of mine, there is another <lb/>
way. Yes, I can kill him; not even the dullest <lb/>
among you will question <i>that</i> right. Ah, you had <lb/>
not thought of that&#x2014;vermin!"</p>
<p>That poor starved fellow begged us with his piteous <lb/>
eyes to save him; then spoke, and said he had a <lb/>
wife and little children at home. Think how it <lb/>
wrung our heartstrings. But what could we do? <lb/>
The Burgundian was within his right. We could <lb/>
only beg and plead for the prisoner. Which we <lb/>
did. And the Burgundian enjoyed it. He stayed <lb/>
his hand to hear more of it, and laugh at it. That <lb/>
stung. Then the Dwarf said:</p>
<p>"Prithee, young sirs, let me beguile him; for <lb/>
when a matter requiring persuasion is to the fore, I <lb/>
have indeed a gift in that sort, as any will tell you <lb/>
that know me well. You smile; and that is punish- <lb/>
ment for my vanity, and fairly earned, I grant it <lb/>
you. Still, if I may toy a little, just a little&#x2014;" <lb/>
saying which he stepped to the Burgundian and <lb/>
began a fair soft speech, all of goodly and gentle <lb/>
tenor; and in the midst he mentioned the Maid; <lb/>
and was going on to say how she out of her good <lb/>
<pb n="47"/>
heart would prize and praise this compassionate deed <lb/>
which he was about to&#x2014;</p>
<p>It was as far as he got. The Burgundian burst <lb/>
into his smooth oration with an insult leveled at <lb/>
Joan of Arc. We sprang forward, but the Dwarf, <lb/>
his face all livid, brushed us aside and said, in a <lb/>
most grave and earnest way:</p>
<p>"I crave your patience. Am not I her guard of <lb/>
honor? This is my affair."</p>
<p>And saying this he suddenly shot his right hand <lb/>
out and gripped the great Burgundian by the throat, <lb/>
and so held him upright on his feet. "You have <lb/>
insulted the Maid," he said; "and the Maid is <lb/>
France. The tongue that does that earns a long <lb/>
furlough."</p>
<p>One heard the muffled cracking of bones. The <lb/>
Burgundian's eyes began to protrude from their <lb/>
sockets and stare with a leaden dullness at vacancy. <lb/>
The color deepened in his face and became an <lb/>
opaque purple. His hands hung down limp, his <lb/>
body collapsed with a shiver, every muscle relaxed <lb/>
its tension and ceased from its function. The Dwarf <lb/>
took away his hand and the column of inert mortality <lb/>
sank mushily to the ground.</p>
<p>We struck the bonds from the prisoner and told <lb/>
him he was free. His crawling humbleness changed <lb/>
to frantic joy in a moment, and his ghastly fear to a <lb/>
childish rage. He flew at that dead corpse and <lb/>
kicked it, spat in its face, danced upon it, crammed <lb/>
mud into its mouth, laughing, jeering, cursing, and <lb/>
<pb n="48"/>
volleying forth indecencies and bestialities like a <lb/>
drunken fiend. It was a thing to be expected: <lb/>
soldiering makes few saints. Many of the on- <lb/>
lookers laughed, others were indifferent, none was <lb/>
surprised. But presently in his mad caperings the <lb/>
freed man capered within reach of the waiting file, <lb/>
and another Burgundian promptly slipped a knife <lb/>
through his neck, and down he went with a death- <lb/>
shriek, his brilliant artery-blood spurting ten feet as <lb/>
straight and bright as a ray of light. There was a <lb/>
great burst of jolly laughter all around from friend <lb/>
and foe alike; and thus closed one of the pleasantest <lb/>
incidents of my checkered military life.</p>
<p>And now came Joan hurrying, and deeply <lb/>
troubled. She considered the claim of the garri- <lb/>
son, then said:</p>
<p>"You have right upon your side. It is plain. <lb/>
It was a careless word to put in the treaty, and <lb/>
covers too much. But ye may not take these poor <lb/>
men away. They are French, and I will not have <lb/>
it. The King shall ransom them, every one. Wait <lb/>
till I send you word from him; and hurt no hair of <lb/>
their heads; for I tell you, I who speak, that that <lb/>
would cost you very dear."</p>
<p>That settled it. The prisoners were safe for one <lb/>
while, anyway. Then she rode back eagerly and <lb/>
required that thing of the King, and would listen to <lb/>
no paltering and no excuses. So the King told her to <lb/>
have her way, and she rode straight back and bought <lb/>
the captives free in his name and let them go.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXXV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was here that we saw again the Grand Master of <lb/>
the King's Household, in whose castle Joan was <lb/>
guest when she tarried at Chinon in those first days <lb/>
of her coming out of her own country. She made <lb/>
him Bailiff of Troyes now by the King's permis- <lb/>
sion.</p>
<p>And now we marched again; Ch&#x00E2;lons surrendered <lb/>
to us; and there by Ch&#x00E2;lons in a talk, Joan, being <lb/>
asked if she had no fears for the future, said yes, <lb/>
one&#x2014;treachery. Who could believe it? who could <lb/>
dream it? And yet in a sense it was prophecy. <lb/>
Truly, man is a pitiful animal.</p>
<p>We marched, marched, kept on marching; and at <lb/>
last, on the 16th of July, we came in sight of our <lb/>
goal, and saw the great cathedral towers of Rheims <lb/>
rise out of the distance! Huzza after huzza swept <lb/>
the army from van to rear; and as for Joan of <lb/>
Arc, there where she sat her horse gazing, clothed <lb/>
all in white armor, dreamy, beautiful, and in her face <lb/>
a deep, deep joy, a joy not of earth, oh, she was <lb/>
not flesh, she was a spirit! Her sublime mission <lb/>
was closing&#x2014;closing in flawless triumph. To- <lb/>
<pb n="50"/>
morrow she could say, "It is finished&#x2014;let me go <lb/>
free."</p>
<p>We camped, and the hurry and rush and turmoil <lb/>
of the grand preparations began. The Archbishop <lb/>
and a great deputation arrived; and after these came <lb/>
flock after flock, crowd after crowd, of citizens and <lb/>
country folk, hurrahing, in, with banners and music, <lb/>
and flowed over the camp, one rejoicing inundation <lb/>
after another, everybody drunk with happiness. <lb/>
And all night long Rheims was hard at work, ham- <lb/>
mering away, decorating the town, building triumphal <lb/>
arches and clothing the ancient cathedral within and <lb/>
without in a glory of opulent splendors.</p>
<p>We moved betimes in the morning; the corona- <lb/>
tion ceremonies would begin at nine and last five <lb/>
hours. We were aware that the garrison of English <lb/>
and Burgundian soldiers had given up all thought of <lb/>
resisting the Maid, and that we should find the gates <lb/>
standing hospitably open and the whole city ready <lb/>
to welcome us with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It was a delicious morning, brilliant with sunshine, <lb/>
but cool and fresh and inspiring. The army was in <lb/>
great form, and fine to see, as it uncoiled from its <lb/>
lair fold by fold, and stretched away on the final <lb/>
march of the peaceful Coronation Campaign.</p>
<p>Joan, on her black horse, with the Lieutenant- <lb/>
General and the personal staff grouped about her, <lb/>
took post for a final review and a good-bye; for she <lb/>
was not expecting to ever be a soldier again, or ever <lb/>
serve with these or any other soldiers any more after <lb/>
<pb n="51"/>
this day. The army knew this, and believed it was <lb/>
looking for the last time upon the girlish face of its <lb/>
invincible little Chief, its pet, its pride, its darling, <lb/>
whom it had ennobled in its private heart with <lb/>
nobilities of its own creation, calling her "Daughter <lb/>
of God," "Saviour of France," "Victory's Sweet- <lb/>
heart," "the Page of Christ," together with still <lb/>
softer titles which were simply na&#x00EF;f and frank endear- <lb/>
ments such as men are used to confer upon children <lb/>
whom they love. And so one saw a new thing <lb/>
now; a thing bred of the emotion that was present <lb/>
there on both sides. Always before, in the march- <lb/>
past, the battalions had gone swinging by in a storm <lb/>
of cheers, heads up and eyes flashing, the drums <lb/>
rolling, the bands braying p&#x00E6;ans of victory; but <lb/>
now there was nothing of that. But for one im- <lb/>
pressive sound, one could have closed his eyes and <lb/>
imagined himself in a world of the dead. That one <lb/>
sound was all that visited the ear in the summer <lb/>
stillness&#x2014;just that one sound&#x2014;the muffled tread <lb/>
of the marching host. As the serried masses drifted <lb/>
by, the men put their right hands up to their <lb/>
temples, palms to the front, in military salute, turn- <lb/>
ing their eyes upon Joan's face in mute God-bless- <lb/>
you and farewell, and keeping them there while they <lb/>
could. They still kept their hands up in reverent <lb/>
salute many steps after they had passed by. Every <lb/>
time Joan put her handkerchief to her eyes you <lb/>
could see a little quiver of emotion crinkle along the <lb/>
faces of the files.</p>
<pb n="52"/>
<p>The march-past after a victory is a thing to drive <lb/>
the heart mad with jubilation; but this one was a <lb/>
thing to break it.</p>
<p>We rode now to the King's lodging, which was <lb/>
the Archbishop's country palace; and he was pres- <lb/>
ently ready, and we galloped off and took position <lb/>
at the head of the army. By this time the country <lb/>
people were arriving in multitudes from every direc- <lb/>
tion and massing themselves on both sides of the <lb/>
road to get sight of Joan&#x2014;just as had been done <lb/>
every day since our first day's march began. Our <lb/>
march now lay through the grassy plain, and those <lb/>
peasants made a dividing double border for that <lb/>
plain. They stretched right down through it, a <lb/>
broad belt of bright colors on each side of the road; <lb/>
for every peasant girl and woman in it had a white <lb/>
jacket on her body and a crimson skirt on the rest <lb/>
of her. Endless borders made of poppies and lilies <lb/>
stretching away in front of us&#x2014;that is what it <lb/>
looked like. And that is the kind of lane we had <lb/>
been marching through all these days. Not a lane <lb/>
between multitudinous flowers standing upright on <lb/>
their stems&#x2014;no, these flowers were always kneel- <lb/>
ing; kneeling, these human flowers, with their hands <lb/>
and faces lifted toward Joan of Arc, and the grateful <lb/>
tears streaming down. And all along, those closest <lb/>
to the road hugged her feet and kissed them and laid <lb/>
their wet cheeks fondly against them. I never, <lb/>
during all those days, saw any of either sex stand <lb/>
while she passed, nor any man keep his head cov- <lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
ered. Afterwards in the Great Trial these touching <lb/>
scenes were used as a weapon against her. She had <lb/>
been made an object of adoration by the people, and <lb/>
this was proof that she was a heretic&#x2014;so claimed <lb/>
that unjust court.</p>
<p>As we drew near the city the curving long sweep <lb/>
of ramparts and towers was gay with fluttering flags <lb/>
and black with masses of people; and all the air <lb/>
was vibrant with the crash of artillery and gloomed <lb/>
with drifting clouds of smoke. We entered the <lb/>
gates in state and moved in procession through the <lb/>
city, with all the guilds and industries in holiday <lb/>
costume marching in our rear with their banners; <lb/>
and all the route was hedged with a huzzaing crush <lb/>
of people, and all the windows were full and all the <lb/>
roofs; and from the balconies hung costly stuffs of <lb/>
rich colors; and the waving of handkerchiefs, seen <lb/>
in perspective through a long vista, was like a snow- <lb/>
storm.</p>
<p>Joan's name had been introduced into the prayers <lb/>
of the Church&#x2014;an honor theretofore restricted to <lb/>
royalty. But she had a dearer honor and an honor <lb/>
more to be proud of, from a humbler source: the <lb/>
common people had had leaden medals struck which <lb/>
bore her effigy and her escutcheon, and these they <lb/>
wore as charms. One saw them everywhere.</p>
<p>From the Archbishop's Palace, where we halted, <lb/>
and where the King and Joan were to lodge, the <lb/>
King sent to the Abbey Church of St. Remi, which <lb/>
was over toward the gate by which we had entered <lb/>
<pb n="54"/>
the city, for the <i>Sainte Ampoule</i>, or flask of holy <lb/>
oil. This oil was not earthly oil; it was made in <lb/>
heaven; the flask also. The flask, with the oil in it, <lb/>
was brought down from heaven by a dove. It was <lb/>
sent down to St. Remi just as he was going to <lb/>
baptize King Clovis, who had become a Christian. <lb/>
I know this to be true. I had known it long before; <lb/>
for P&#x00E8;re Fronte told me in Domremy. I cannot <lb/>
tell you how strange and awful it made me feel <lb/>
when I saw that flask and knew I was looking with <lb/>
my own eyes upon a thing which had actually been <lb/>
in heaven; a thing which had been seen by angels, <lb/>
perhaps; and by God Himself of a certainty, for <lb/>
He sent it. And I was looking upon it&#x2014;I. At <lb/>
one time I could have touched it. But I was afraid; <lb/>
for I could not know but that God had touched it. <lb/>
It is most probable that He had.</p>
<p>From this flask Clovis had been anointed; and <lb/>
from it all the kings of France had been anointed <lb/>
since. Yes, ever since the time of Clovis; and that <lb/>
was nine hundred years. And so, as I have said, <lb/>
that flask of holy oil was sent for, while we waited. <lb/>
A coronation without that would not have been a <lb/>
coronation at all, in my belief.</p>
<p>Now in order to get the flask, a most ancient <lb/>
ceremonial had to be gone through with; otherwise <lb/>
the Abb&#x00E9; of St. Remi, hereditary guardian in per- <lb/>
petuity of the oil, would not deliver it. So, in ac- <lb/>
cordance with custom, the King deputed five great <lb/>
nobles to ride in solemn state and richly armed and <lb/>
<pb n="55"/>
accoutered, they and their steeds, to the Abbey <lb/>
Church as a guard of honor to the Archbishop of <lb/>
Rheims and his canons, who were to bear the King's <lb/>
demand for the oil. When the five great lords were <lb/>
ready to start, they knelt in a row and put up their <lb/>
mailed hands before their faces, palm joined to <lb/>
palm, and swore upon their lives to conduct the <lb/>
sacred vessel safely, and safely restore it again to <lb/>
the Church of St. Remi after the anointing of the <lb/>
King. The Archbishop and his subordinates, thus <lb/>
nobly escorted, took their way to St. Remi. The <lb/>
Archbishop was in grand costume, with his mitre on <lb/>
his head and his cross in his hand. At the door of <lb/>
St. Remi they halted and formed, to receive the <lb/>
holy phial. Soon one heard the deep tones of the <lb/>
organ and of chanting men; then one saw a long <lb/>
file of lights approaching through the dim church. <lb/>
And so came the Abbot, in his sacerdotal panoply, <lb/>
bearing the phial, with his people following after. <lb/>
He delivered it, with solemn ceremonies, to the <lb/>
Archbishop; then the march back began, and it <lb/>
was most impressive; for it moved, the whole way, <lb/>
between two multitudes of men and women who lay <lb/>
flat upon their faces and prayed in dumb silence and <lb/>
in dread while that awful thing went by that had <lb/>
been in heaven.</p>
<p>This august company arrived at the great west <lb/>
door of the cathedral; and as the Archbishop <lb/>
entered a noble anthem rose and filled the vast <lb/>
building. The cathedral was packed with people&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="56"/>
people in thousands. Only a wide space down the <lb/>
center had been kept free. Down this space walked <lb/>
the Archbishop and his canons, and after them fol- <lb/>
lowed those five stately figures in splendid harness, <lb/>
each bearing his feudal banner&#x2014;and riding!</p>
<p>Oh, that was a magnificent thing to see. Riding <lb/>
down the cavernous vastness of the building through <lb/>
the rich lights streaming in long rays from the pic- <lb/>
tured windows&#x2014;oh, there was never anything so <lb/>
grand!</p>
<p>They rode clear to the choir&#x2014;as much as four <lb/>
hundred feet from the door, it was said. Then the <lb/>
Archbishop dismissed them, and they made deep <lb/>
obeisance till their plumes touched their horses' <lb/>
necks, then made those proud prancing and mincing <lb/>
and dancing creatures go backwards all the way to <lb/>
the door&#x2014;which was pretty to see, and graceful; <lb/>
then they stood them on their hind-feet and spun <lb/>
them around and plunged away and disappeared.</p>
<p>For some minutes there was a deep hush, a wait- <lb/>
ing pause; a silence so profound that it was as if all <lb/>
those packed thousands there were steeped in dream- <lb/>
less slumber&#x2014;why, you could even notice the faint- <lb/>
est sounds, like the drowsy buzzing of insects; then <lb/>
came a mighty flood of rich strains from four hun- <lb/>
dred silver trumpets, and then, framed in the pointed <lb/>
archway of the great west door, appeared Joan and <lb/>
the King. They advanced slowly, side by side, <lb/>
through a tempest of welcome&#x2014;explosion after ex- <lb/>
plosion of cheers and cries, mingled with the deep <lb/>
<pb n="57"/>
thunders of the organ and rolling tides of triumphant <lb/>
song from chanting choirs. Behind Joan and the <lb/>
King came the Paladin with the Banner displayed; <lb/>
and a majestic figure he was, and most proud and <lb/>
lofty in his bearing, for he knew that the people <lb/>
were marking him and taking note of the gorgeous <lb/>
state dress which covered his armor.</p>
<p>At his side was the Sire d'Albret, proxy for the <lb/>
Constable of France, bearing the Sword of State.</p>
<p>After these, in order of rank, came a body royally <lb/>
attired representing the lay peers of France; it con- <lb/>
sisted of three princes of the blood, and La Tre- <lb/>
mouille and the young De Laval brothers.</p>
<p>These were followed by the representatives of the <lb/>
ecclesiastical peers&#x2014;the Archbishop of Rheims, and <lb/>
the Bishops of Laon, Ch&#x00E2;lons, Orleans, and one <lb/>
other.</p>
<p>Behind these came the Grand Staff, all our great <lb/>
generals and famous names, and everybody was eager <lb/>
to get a sight of them. Through all the din one <lb/>
could hear shouts all along that told you where two <lb/>
of them were: "Live the Bastard of Orleans!" <lb/>
"Satan La Hire forever!"</p>
<p>The august procession reached its appointed place <lb/>
in time, and the solemnities of the Coronation began. <lb/>
They were long and imposing&#x2014;with prayers, and <lb/>
anthems, and sermons, and everything that is right <lb/>
for such occasions; and Joan was at the King's side <lb/>
all these hours, with her Standard in her hand. But <lb/>
at last came the grand act: the King took the oath, <lb/>
<pb n="58"/>
he was anointed with the sacred oil; a splendid <lb/>
personage, followed by train-bearers and other at- <lb/>
tendants, approached, bearing the Crown of France <lb/>
upon a cushion, and kneeling offered it. The King <lb/>
seemed to hesitate&#x2014;in fact, <i>did</i> hesitate; for he <lb/>
put out his hand and then stopped with it there in <lb/>
the air over the crown, the fingers in the attitude of <lb/>
taking hold of it. But that was for only a moment <lb/>
&#x2014;though a moment is a notable something when it <lb/>
stops the heart-beat of twenty thousand people and <lb/>
makes them catch their breath. Yes, only a mo- <lb/>
ment; then he caught Joan's eye, and she gave him <lb/>
a look with all the joy of her thankful great soul in <lb/>
it, then he smiled, and took the Crown of France in <lb/>
his hand, and right finely and right royally lifted it <lb/>
up and set it upon his head.</p>
<p>Then what a crash there was! All about us cries <lb/>
and cheers, and the chanting of the choirs and <lb/>
groaning of the organ; and outside the clamoring <lb/>
of the bells and the booming of the cannon.</p>
<p>The fantastic dream, the incredible dream, the <lb/>
impossible dream of the peasant child stood fulfilled: <lb/>
the English power was broken, the Heir of France <lb/>
was crowned.</p>
<p>She was like one transfigured, so divine was the <lb/>
joy that shone in her face as she sank to her knees <lb/>
at the King's feet and looked up at him through her <lb/>
tears. Her lips were quivering, and her words came <lb/>
soft and low and broken:</p>
<p>"Now, O gentle King, is the pleasure of God <lb/>
<pb n="59"/>
accomplished according to his command that you <lb/>
should come to Rheims and receive the crown that <lb/>
belongeth of right to you, and unto none other. <lb/>
My work which was given me to do is finished; give <lb/>
me your peace, and let me go back to my mother, <lb/>
who is poor and old, and has need of me."</p>
<p>The King raised her up, and there before all that <lb/>
host he praised her great deeds in most noble terms; <lb/>
and there he confirmed her nobility and titles, <lb/>
making her the equal of a count in rank, and also <lb/>
appointed a household and officers for her accord- <lb/>
ing to her dignity; and then he said:</p>
<p>"You have saved the crown. Speak&#x2014;require&#x2014; <lb/>
demand; and whatsoever grace you ask it shall be <lb/>
granted, though it make the kingdom poor to meet <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>Now that was fine, that was royal. Joan was on <lb/>
her knees again straightway, and said:</p>
<p>"Then, O gentle King, if out of your compas- <lb/>
sion you will speak the word, I pray you give <lb/>
commandment that my village, poor and hard <lb/>
pressed by reason of the war, may have its taxes <lb/>
remitted."</p>
<p>"It is so commanded. Say on."</p>
<p>"That is all."</p>
<p>"All? Nothing but that?"</p>
<p>"It is all. I have no other desire."</p>
<p>"But that is nothing&#x2014;less than nothing. Ask <lb/>
&#x2014;do not be afraid."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I cannot, gentle King. Do not press <lb/>
<pb n="60"/>
me. I will not have aught else, but only this <lb/>
alone."</p>
<p>The King seemed nonplussed, and stood still a <lb/>
moment, as if trying to comprehend and realize the <lb/>
full stature of this strange unselfishness. Then he <lb/>
raised his head and said:</p>
<p>"She has won a kingdom and crowned its King; <lb/>
and all she asks and all she will take is this poor <lb/>
grace&#x2014;and even this is for others, not for herself. <lb/>
And it is well; her act being proportioned to the <lb/>
dignity of one who carries in her head and heart <lb/>
riches which outvalue any that any King could add, <lb/>
though he gave his all. She shall have her way. <lb/>
Now, therefore, it is decreed that from this day <lb/>
forth Domremy, natal village of Joan of Arc, De- <lb/>
liverer of France, called the Maid of Orleans, is <lb/>
freed from all taxation <i>forever</i>." Whereat the silver <lb/>
horns blew a jubilant blast.</p>
<p>There, you see, she had had a vision of this very <lb/>
scene the time she was in a trance in the pastures of <lb/>
Domremy, and we asked her to name the boon she <lb/>
would demand of the King if he should ever chance <lb/>
to tell her she might claim one. But whether she <lb/>
had the vision or not, this act showed that after all <lb/>
the dizzy grandeurs that had come upon her, she <lb/>
was still the same simple, unselfish creature that she <lb/>
was that day.</p>
<p>Yes, Charles VII. remitted those taxes "forever." <lb/>
Often the gratitude of kings and nations fades and <lb/>
their promises are forgotten or deliberately violated; <lb/>
<pb n="61"/>
but you, who are children of France, should remem- <lb/>
ber with pride that France has kept this one faith- <lb/>
fully. Sixty-three years have gone by since that <lb/>
day. The taxes of the region wherein Domremy <lb/>
lies have been collected sixty-three times since then, <lb/>
and all the villages of that region have paid except <lb/>
that one&#x2014;Domremy. The tax-gatherer never visits <lb/>
Domremy. Domremy has long ago forgotten what <lb/>
that dreaded sorrow-sowing apparition is like. <lb/>
Sixty-three tax-books have been filled meantime, <lb/>
and they lie yonder with the other public records, <lb/>
and any may see them that desire it. At the top of <lb/>
every page in the sixty-three books stands the name <lb/>
of a village, and below that name its weary burden <lb/>
of taxation is figured out and displayed; in the case <lb/>
of all save one. It is true, just as I tell you. In <lb/>
each of the sixty-three books there is a page headed <lb/>
"Domremi," but under that name not a figure ap- <lb/>
pears. Where the figures should be, there are three <lb/>
words written; and the same words have been written <lb/>
every year for all these years; yes, it is a blank <lb/>
page, with always those grateful words lettered <lb/>
across the face of it&#x2014;a touching memorial. Thus:</p>
<figure/>
<pb n="62"/>
<p>"<smcap>Nothing&#x2014;the Maid of Orleans</smcap>." How <lb/>
brief it is; yet how much it says! It is the nation <lb/>
speaking. You have the spectacle of that unsenti- <lb/>
mental thing, a Government, making reverence to <lb/>
that name and saying to its agent, "<i>Uncover and <lb/>
pass on; it is France that commands</i>." Yes, the <lb/>
promise has been kept; it will be kept always; <lb/>
"forever" was the King's word.<ref target="n2">*</ref><note id="n2" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>It was faithfully kept during three hundred and sixty years and <lb/>
more; then the over-confident octogenarian's prophecy failed. During <lb/>
the tumult of the French Revolution the promise was forgotten and the <lb/>
grace withdrawn. It has remained in disuse ever since. Joan never <lb/>
asked to be remembered, but France has remembered her with an inex- <lb/>
tinguishable love and reverence: Joan never asked for a statue, but <lb/>
France has lavished them upon her; Joan never asked for a church for <lb/>
Domremy, but France is building one; Joan never asked for saintship, <lb/>
but even that is impending. Everything which Joan of Arc did not <lb/>
ask for has been given her, and with a noble profusion; but the one <lb/>
humble little thing which she did ask for and get has been taken away <lb/>
from her. There is something infinitely pathetic about this. France <lb/>
owes Domremy a hundred years of taxes, and could hardly find a citizen <lb/>
within her borders who would vote against the payment of the debt.&#x2014; <lb/>

<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon the ceremonies of <lb/>
the Coronation came at last to an end; then the <lb/>
procession formed once more, with Joan and the <lb/>
King at its head, and took up its solemn march <lb/>
through the midst of the church, all instruments and <lb/>
all people making such clamor of rejoicing noises as <lb/>
was, indeed, a marvel to hear. And so ended the <lb/>
third of the great days of Joan's life. And how <lb/>
close together they stand&#x2014;May 8th, June 18th, <lb/>
July 17th!</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXXVI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> mounted and rode, a spectacle to remember, <lb/>
a most noble display of rich vestments and <lb/>
nodding plumes, and as we moved between the <lb/>
banked multitudes they sank down all along abreast <lb/>
of us as we advanced, like grain before the reaper, <lb/>
and kneeling hailed with a rousing welcome the con- <lb/>
secrated King and his companion the Deliverer of <lb/>
France. But by and by when we had paraded about <lb/>
the chief parts of the city and were come near to the <lb/>
end of our course, we being now approaching the <lb/>
Archbishop's palace, one saw on the right, hard by <lb/>
the inn that is called the Zebra, a strange thing&#x2014; <lb/>
two men not kneeling but <i>standing!</i> Standing in <lb/>
the front rank of the kneelers; unconscious, trans- <lb/>
fixed, staring. Yes, and clothed in the coarse garb <lb/>
of the peasantry, these two. Two halberdiers sprang <lb/>
at them in a fury to teach them better manners; but <lb/>
just as they seized them Joan cried out "Forbear!" <lb/>
and slid from her saddle and flung her arms about <lb/>
one of those peasants, calling him by all manner of <lb/>
endearing names, and sobbing. For it was her <lb/>
father; and the other was her uncle, Laxart.</p>
<p>The news flew everywhere, and shouts of welcome <lb/>
<pb n="64"/>
were raised, and in just one little moment those two <lb/>
despised and unknown plebeians were become <lb/>
famous and popular and envied, and everybody was <lb/>
in a fever to get sight of them and be able to say, <lb/>
all their lives long, that they had seen the father of <lb/>
Joan of Arc and the brother of her mother. How <lb/>
easy it was for her to do miracles like to this! She <lb/>
was like the sun; on whatsoever dim and humble <lb/>
object her rays fell, that thing was straightway <lb/>
drowned in glory.</p>
<p>All graciously the King said:</p>
<p>"Bring them to me."</p>
<p>And she brought them; she radiant with happi- <lb/>
ness and affection, they trembling and scared, with <lb/>
their caps in their shaking hands; and there before <lb/>
all the world the King gave them his hand to kiss, <lb/>
while the people gazed in envy and admiration; and <lb/>
he said to old D'Arc:</p>
<p>"Give God thanks for that you are father to this <lb/>
child, this dispenser of immortalities. You who <lb/>
bear a name that will still live in the mouths of men <lb/>
when all the race of kings has been forgotten, it is <lb/>
not meet that you bare your head before the fleeting <lb/>
fames and dignities of a day&#x2014;cover yourself!" <lb/>
And truly he looked right fine and princely when he <lb/>
said that. Then he gave order that the Bailly of <lb/>
Rheims be brought; and when he was come, and <lb/>
stood bent low and bare, the King said to him, <lb/>
"These two are guests of France;" and bade him <lb/>
use them hospitably.</p>
<pb n="65"/>
<p>I may as well say now as later, that Papa D'Arc <lb/>
and Laxart were stopping in that little Zebra inn, <lb/>
and that there they remained. Finer quarters were <lb/>
offered them by the Bailly, also public distinctions <lb/>
and brave entertainment; but they were frightened <lb/>
at these projects, they being only humble and igno- <lb/>
rant peasants; so they begged off, and had peace. <lb/>
They could not have enjoyed such things. Poor <lb/>
souls, they did not even know what to do with their <lb/>
hands, and it took all their attention to keep from <lb/>
treading on them. The Bailly did the best he could <lb/>
in the circumstances. He made the innkeeper place <lb/>
a whole floor at their disposal, and told him to pro- <lb/>
vide everything they might desire, and charge all to <lb/>
the city. Also the Bailly gave them a horse apiece <lb/>
and furnishings; which so overwhelmed them with <lb/>
pride and delight and astonishment that they <lb/>
couldn't speak a word; for in their lives they had <lb/>
never dreamed of wealth like this, and could not <lb/>
believe, at first, that the horses were real and would <lb/>
not dissolve to a mist and blow away. They could <lb/>
not unglue their minds from those grandeurs, and <lb/>
were always wrenching the conversation out of its <lb/>
groove and dragging the matter of animals into it, <lb/>
so that they could say "my horse" here, and "my <lb/>
horse" there and yonder and all around, and taste <lb/>
the words and lick their chops over them, and <lb/>
spread their legs and hitch their thumbs in their <lb/>
armpits, and feel as the good God feels when He <lb/>
looks out on His fleets of constellations plowing <lb/>
<pb n="66"/>
the awful deeps of space and reflects with satis- <lb/>
faction that they are His&#x2014;all His. Well, they <lb/>
<i>were</i> the happiest old children one ever saw, and the <lb/>
simplest.</p>
<p>The city gave a grand banquet to the King and <lb/>
Joan in mid-afternoon, and to the Court and the <lb/>
Grand Staff; and about the middle of it P&#x00E8;re d'Arc <lb/>
and Laxart were sent for, but would not venture <lb/>
until it was promised that they might sit in a gallery <lb/>
and be all by themselves and see all that was to be <lb/>
seen and yet be unmolested. And so they sat there <lb/>
and looked down upon the splendid spectacle, and <lb/>
were moved till the tears ran down their cheeks to <lb/>
see the unbelievable honors that were paid to their <lb/>
small darling, and how na&#x00EF;vely serene and unafraid <lb/>
she sat there with those consuming glories beating <lb/>
upon her.</p>
<p>But at last her serenity was broken up. Yes, it <lb/>
stood the strain of the King's gracious speech; <lb/>
and of D'Alen&#x00E7;on's praiseful words, and the Bas- <lb/>
tard's; and even La Hire's thunder-blast, which <lb/>
took the place by storm; but at last, as I have said, <lb/>
they brought a force to bear which was too strong <lb/>
for her. For at the close the King put up his hand <lb/>
to command silence, and so waited, with his hand <lb/>
up, till every sound was dead and it was as if one <lb/>
could almost <i>feel</i> the stillness, so profound it was. <lb/>
Then out of some remote corner of that vast place <lb/>
there rose a plaintive voice, and in tones most tender <lb/>
and sweet and rich came floating through that en- <lb/>
<pb n="67"/>
chanted hush our poor old simple song "L'Arbre <lb/>
F&#x00E9;e le Bourlemont!" and then Joan broke down <lb/>
and put her face in her hands and cried. Yes, you <lb/>
see, all in a moment the pomps and grandeurs dis- <lb/>
solved away and she was a little child again herding <lb/>
her sheep with the tranquil pastures stretched about <lb/>
her, and war and wounds and blood and death and <lb/>
the mad frenzy and turmoil of battle a dream. Ah, <lb/>
that shows you the power of music, that magician <lb/>
of magicians, who lifts his wand and says his mys- <lb/>
terious word and all things real pass away and the <lb/>
phantoms of your mind walk before you clothed in <lb/>
flesh.</p>
<p>That was the King's invention, that sweet and <lb/>
dear surprise. Indeed, he had fine things hidden <lb/>
away in his nature, though one seldom got a glimpse <lb/>
of them, with that scheming Tremouille and those <lb/>
others always standing in the light, and he so indo- <lb/>
lently content to save himself fuss and argument and <lb/>
let them have their way.</p>
<p>At the fall of night we the Domremy contingent <lb/>
of the personal staff were with the father and uncle <lb/>
at the inn, in their private parlor, brewing generous <lb/>
drinks and breaking ground for a homely talk about <lb/>
Domremy and the neighbors, when a large parcel <lb/>
arrived from Joan to be kept till she came; and <lb/>
soon she came herself and sent her guard away, <lb/>
saying she would take one of her father's rooms and <lb/>
sleep under his roof, and so be at home again. We <lb/>
of the staff rose and stood, as was meet, until she <lb/>
<pb n="68"/>
made us sit. Then she turned and saw that the two <lb/>
old men had gotten up too, and were standing in an <lb/>
embarrassed and unmilitary way; which made her <lb/>
want to laugh, but she kept it in, as not wishing to <lb/>
hurt them; and got them to their seats and snug- <lb/>
gled down between them, and took a hand of each <lb/>
of them upon her knees and nestled her own hands <lb/>
in them, and said:</p>
<p>"Now we will have no more ceremony, but be <lb/>
kin and playmates as in other times; for I am done <lb/>
with the great wars now, and you two will take me <lb/>
home with you, and I shall see&#x2014;" She stopped, <lb/>
and for a moment her happy face sobered, as if a <lb/>
doubt or a presentiment had flitted through her <lb/>
mind; then it cleared again, and she said, with a <lb/>
passionate yearning, "Oh, if the day were but come <lb/>
and we could start!"</p>
<p>The old father was surprised, and said:</p>
<p>"Why, child, are you in earnest? Would you <lb/>
leave doing these wonders that make you to be <lb/>
praised by everybody while there is still so much <lb/>
glory to be won; and would you go out from this <lb/>
grand comradeship with princes and generals to be a <lb/>
drudging villager again and a nobody? It is not <lb/>
rational."</p>
<p>"No," said the uncle, Laxart, "it is amazing to <lb/>
hear, and indeed not understandable. It is a stranger <lb/>
thing to hear her say she will stop the soldiering than <lb/>
it was to hear her say she would begin it; and I who <lb/>
speak to you can say in all truth that that was the <lb/>
<pb n="69"/>
strangest word that ever I had heard till this day and <lb/>
hour. I would it could be explained."</p>
<p>"It is not difficult," said Joan. "I was not ever <lb/>
fond of wounds and suffering, nor fitted by my <lb/>
nature to inflict them; and quarrelings did always <lb/>
distress me, and noise and tumult were against my <lb/>
liking, my disposition being toward peace and quiet- <lb/>
ness, and love for all things that have life; and <lb/>
being made like this, how could I bear to think of <lb/>
wars and blood, and the pain that goes with them, <lb/>
and the sorrow and mourning that follow after? <lb/>
But by his angels God laid His great commands <lb/>
upon me, and could I disobey? I did as I was bid. <lb/>
Did He command me to do many things? No; only <lb/>
two: to raise the siege of Orleans, and crown the <lb/>
King at Rheims. The task is finished, and I am free. <lb/>
Has ever a poor soldier fallen in my sight, whether <lb/>
friend or foe, and I not felt his pain in my own <lb/>
body, and the grief of his home-mates in my own <lb/>
heart? No, not one; and, oh, it is such bliss to <lb/>
know that my release is won, and that I shall not <lb/>
any more see these cruel things or suffer these tor- <lb/>
tures of the mind again! Then why should I not <lb/>
go to my village and be as I was before? It is <lb/>
heaven! and ye wonder that I desire it. Ah, ye are <lb/>
men&#x2014;just men! My mother would understand."</p>
<p>They didn't quite know what to say; so they sat <lb/>
still awhile, looking pretty vacant. Then old D'Arc <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Yes, your mother&#x2014;that is true. I never saw <lb/>
<pb n="70"/>
such a woman. She worries, and worries, and <lb/>
worries; and wakes nights, and lies so, thinking&#x2014; <lb/>
that is, worrying; worrying about you. And when <lb/>
the night-storms go raging along, she moans and <lb/>
says, 'Ah, God pity her, she is out in this with her <lb/>
poor wet soldiers.' And when the lightning glares <lb/>
and the thunder crashes she wrings her hands and <lb/>
trembles, saying, 'It is like the awful cannon and <lb/>
the flash, and yonder somewhere she is riding down <lb/>
upon the spouting guns and I not there to protect <lb/>
her.'"</p>
<p>"Ah, poor mother, it is pity, it is pity!"</p>
<p>"Yes, a most strange woman, as I have noticed <lb/>
a many times. When there is news of a victory <lb/>
and all the village goes mad with pride and joy, she <lb/>
rushes here and there in a maniacal frenzy till she <lb/>
finds out the one only thing she cares to know&#x2014; <lb/>
that you are safe; then down she goes on her knees <lb/>
in the dirt and praises God as long as there is any <lb/>
breath left in her body; and all on your account, <lb/>
for she never mentions the battle once. And always <lb/>
she says, '<i>Now</i> it is over&#x2014;<i>now</i> France is saved&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>now</i> she will come home'&#x2014;and always is disap- <lb/>
pointed and goes about mourning."</p>
<p>"Don't, father! it breaks my heart. I will be <lb/>
so good to her when I get home. I will do her <lb/>
work for her, and be her comfort, and she shall not <lb/>
suffer any more through me."</p>
<p>There was some more talk of this sort, then Uncle <lb/>
Laxart said:</p>
<pb n="71"/>
<p>"You have done the will of God, dear, and are <lb/>
quits; it is true, and none may deny it; but what <lb/>
of the King? You are his best soldier; what if he <lb/>
command you to stay?"</p>
<p>That was a crusher&#x2014;and sudden! It took Joan <lb/>
a moment or two to recover from the shock of it; <lb/>
then she said, quite simply and resignedly:</p>
<p>"The King is my Lord; I am his servant." She <lb/>
was silent and thoughtful a little while, then she <lb/>
brightened up and said, cheerily, "But let us drive <lb/>
such thoughts away&#x2014;this is no time for them. <lb/>
Tell me about home."</p>
<p>So the two old gossips talked and talked; talked <lb/>
about everything and everybody in the village; and <lb/>
it was good to hear. Joan out of her kindness tried <lb/>
to get <i>us</i> into the conversation, but that failed, of <lb/>
course. She was the Commander-in-Chief, we were <lb/>
nobodies; her name was the mightiest in France, <lb/>
we were invisible atoms; she was the comrade of <lb/>
princes and heroes, we of the humble and obscure; <lb/>
she held rank above all Personages and all Puissances <lb/>
whatsoever in the whole earth, by right of bearing <lb/>
her commission direct from God. To put it in one <lb/>
word, she was <smcap>Joan of Arc</smcap>&#x2014;and when that is <lb/>
said, all is said. To us she was divine. Between <lb/>
her and us lay the bridgeless abyss which that word <lb/>
implies. We could not be familiar with her. No, <lb/>
you can see yourselves that that would have been <lb/>
impossible.</p>
<p>And yet she was so human, too, and so good and <lb/>
<pb n="72"/>
kind and dear and loving and cheery and charm- <lb/>
ing and unspoiled and unaffected! Those are all <lb/>
the words I think of now, but they are not enough; <lb/>
no, they are too few and colorless and meager to tell <lb/>
it all, or tell the half. Those simple old men didn't <lb/>
realize her; they couldn't; they had never known <lb/>
any people but human beings, and so they had no <lb/>
other standard to measure her by. To them, after <lb/>
their first little shyness had worn off, she was just a <lb/>
girl&#x2014;that was all. It was amazing. It made one <lb/>
shiver, sometimes, to see how calm and easy and <lb/>
comfortable they were in her presence, and hear <lb/>
them talk to her exactly as they would have talked <lb/>
to any other girl in France.</p>
<p>Why, that simple old Laxart sat up there and <lb/>
droned out the most tedious and empty tale one ever <lb/>
heard, and neither he nor Papa D'Arc ever gave a <lb/>
thought to the badness of the etiquette of it, or ever <lb/>
suspected that that foolish tale was anything but <lb/>
dignified and valuable history. There was not an <lb/>
atom of value in it; and whilst they thought it dis- <lb/>
tressing and pathetic, it was in fact not pathetic at <lb/>
all, but actually ridiculous. At least it seemed so <lb/>
to me, and it seems so yet. Indeed, I know it was, <lb/>
because it made Joan laugh; and the more sorrow- <lb/>
ful it got the more it made her laugh; and the <lb/>
Paladin said that he could have laughed himself if <lb/>
she had not been there, and No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson said <lb/>
the same. It was about old Laxart going to a <lb/>
funeral there at Domremy two or three weeks back. <lb/>
<pb n="73"/>
He had spots all over his face and hands, and he got <lb/>
Joan to rub some healing ointment on them, and <lb/>
while she was doing it, and comforting him, and <lb/>
trying to say pitying things to him, he told her how <lb/>
it happened. And first he asked her if she remem- <lb/>
bered that black bull calf that she left behind when <lb/>
she came away, and she said indeed she did, and he <lb/>
was a dear, and she loved him so, and was he well? <lb/>
&#x2014;and just drowned him in questions about that <lb/>
creature. And he said it was a young bull now, <lb/>
and very frisky; and he was to bear a principal <lb/>
hand at a funeral; and she said, "The bull?" and <lb/>
he said, "No, myself;" but said the bull <i>did</i> take <lb/>
a hand, but not because of his being invited, for he <lb/>
wasn't; but anyway he was away over beyond the <lb/>
Fairy Tree, and fell asleep on the grass with his <lb/>
Sunday funeral clothes on, and a long black rag on <lb/>
his hat and hanging down his back; and when he <lb/>
woke he saw by the sun how late it was, and not a <lb/>
moment to lose; and jumped up terribly worried, <lb/>
and saw the young bull grazing there, and thought <lb/>
maybe he could ride part way on him and gain <lb/>
time; so he tied a rope around the bull's body to <lb/>
hold on by, and put a halter on him to steer with, <lb/>
and jumped on and started; but it was all new to <lb/>
the bull, and he was discontented with it, and scur- <lb/>
ried around and bellowed and reared and pranced, <lb/>
and Uncle Laxart was satisfied, and wanted to get <lb/>
off and go by the next bull or some other way that <lb/>
was quieter, but he didn't dare try; and it was get- <lb/>
<pb n="74"/>
ting very warm for him, too, and disturbing and <lb/>
wearisome, and not proper for Sunday; but by and <lb/>
by the bull lost all his temper, and went tearing <lb/>
down the slope with his tail in the air and bellowing <lb/>
in the most awful way; and just in the edge of the <lb/>
village he knocked down some beehives, and the <lb/>
bees turned out and joined the excursion, and soared <lb/>
along in a black cloud that nearly hid those other <lb/>
two from sight, and prodded them both, and jabbed <lb/>
them and speared them and spiked them, and made <lb/>
them bellow and shriek, and shriek and bellow; and <lb/>
here they came roaring through the village like a <lb/>
hurricane, and took the funeral procession right in <lb/>
the center, and sent that section of it sprawling, and <lb/>
galloped over it, and the rest scattered apart and <lb/>
fled screeching in every direction, every person with <lb/>
a layer of bees on him, and not a rag of that funeral <lb/>
left but the corpse; and finally the bull broke for <lb/>
the river and jumped in, and when they fished Uncle <lb/>
Laxart out he was nearly drowned, and his face <lb/>
looked like a pudding with raisins in it. And then <lb/>
he turned around, this old simpleton, and looked a <lb/>
long time in a dazed way at Joan where she had her <lb/>
face in a cushion, dying, apparently, and says:</p>
<p>"What do you reckon she is laughing at?"</p>
<p>And old D'Arc stood looking at her the same <lb/>
way, sort of absently scratching his head; but had <lb/>
to give it up, and said <i>he</i> didn't know&#x2014;"must <lb/>
have been something that happened when we weren't <lb/>
noticing."</p>
<pb n="75"/>
<p>Yes, both of those old people thought that that <lb/>
tale was pathetic; whereas to my mind it was purely <lb/>
ridiculous, and not in any way valuable to any one. <lb/>
It seemed so to me then, and it seems so to me yet. <lb/>
And as for history, it does not resemble history, for <lb/>
the office of history is to furnish serious and im- <lb/>
portant facts that <i>teach;</i> whereas this strange and <lb/>
useless event teaches nothing; nothing that I can <lb/>
see, except not to ride a bull to a funeral; and <lb/>
surely no reflecting person needs to be taught that.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXXVII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Now</smcap> these were nobles, you know, by decree of the <lb/>
King!&#x2014;these precious old infants. But they <lb/>
did not realize it; they could not be called conscious <lb/>
of it; it was an abstraction, a phantom; to them it <lb/>
had no substance; their minds could not take hold <lb/>
of it. No, they did not bother about their nobility; <lb/>
they lived in their horses. The horses were solid; <lb/>
they were visible facts, and would make a mighty <lb/>
stir in Domremy. Presently something was said <lb/>
about the Coronation, and old D'Arc said it was go- <lb/>
ing to be a grand thing to be able to say, when they <lb/>
got home, that they were present in the very town <lb/>
itself when it happened. Joan looked troubled, and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Ah, that reminds me. You were here and you <lb/>
didn't send me word. In the town, indeed! Why, <lb/>
you could have sat with the other nobles, and been <lb/>
welcome; and could have looked upon the crowning <lb/>
itself, and carried <i>that</i> home to tell. Ah, why did <lb/>
you use me so, and send me no word?"</p>
<p>The old father was embarrassed, now, quite visibly <lb/>
embarrassed, and had the air of one who does not <lb/>
<pb n="77"/>
quite know what to say. But Joan was looking up <lb/>
in his face, her hands upon his shoulders&#x2014;waiting. <lb/>
He had to speak; so presently he drew her to his <lb/>
breast, which was heaving with emotion; and he <lb/>
said, getting out his words with difficulty:</p>
<p>"There, hide your face, child, and let your old <lb/>
father humble himself and make his confession. I <lb/>
&#x2014;I&#x2014;don't you see, don't you understand?&#x2014;I <lb/>
could not know that these grandeurs would not turn <lb/>
your young head&#x2014;it would be only natural. I <lb/>
might shame you before these great per&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Father!"</p>
<p>"And then I was afraid, as remembering that cruel <lb/>
thing I said once in my sinful anger. Oh, appointed <lb/>
of God to be a soldier, and the greatest in the land! <lb/>
and in my ignorant anger I said I would drown you <lb/>
with my own hands if you unsexed yourself and <lb/>
brought shame to your name and family. Ah, how <lb/>
could I ever have said it, and you so good and dear <lb/>
and innocent! I was afraid; for I was guilty. You <lb/>
understand it now, my child, and you forgive?"</p>
<p>Do you see? Even that poor groping old land- <lb/>
crab, with his skull full of pulp, had pride. Isn't it <lb/>
wonderful? And more&#x2014;he had conscience; he <lb/>
had a sense of right and wrong, such as it was; he <lb/>
was able to feel remorse. It looks impossible, it <lb/>
looks incredible, but it is not. I believe that some <lb/>
day it will be found out that peasants are people. <lb/>
Yes, beings in a great many respects like ourselves. <lb/>
And I believe that some day <i>they</i> will find this out, <lb/>
<pb n="78"/>
too&#x2014;and then! Well, then I think they will rise <lb/>
up and demand to be regarded as part of the race, <lb/>
and that by consequence there will be trouble. <lb/>
Whenever one sees in a book or in a king's proclama- <lb/>
tion those words "the nation," they bring before us <lb/>
the upper classes; only those; we know no other <lb/>
"nation"; for us and the kings no other "nation" <lb/>
exists. But from the day that I saw old D'Arc <lb/>
the peasant acting and feeling just as I should have <lb/>
acted and felt myself, I have carried the con- <lb/>
viction in my heart that our peasants are not merely <lb/>
animals, beasts of burden put here by the good God <lb/>
to produce food and comfort for the "nation," but <lb/>
something more and better. You look incredulous. <lb/>
Well, that is your training; it is the training of <lb/>
everybody; but as for me, I thank that incident <lb/>
for giving me a better light, and I have never <lb/>
forgotten it.</p>
<p>Let me see&#x2014;where was I? One's mind wanders <lb/>
around here and there and yonder, when one is <lb/>
old. I think I said Joan comforted him. Certainly, <lb/>
that is what she would do&#x2014;there was no need to say <lb/>
that. She coaxed him and petted him and caressed <lb/>
him, and laid the memory of that old hard speech of <lb/>
his to rest. Laid it to rest until she should be dead. <lb/>
Then he would remember it again&#x2014;yes, yes! <lb/>
Lord, how those things sting, and burn, and gnaw <lb/>
&#x2014;the things which we did against the innocent <lb/>
dead! And we say in our anguish, "If they could <lb/>
only come back!" Which is all very well to say, <lb/>
<pb n="79"/>
but, as far as I can see, it doesn't profit anything. <lb/>
In my opinion the best way is not to do the thing in <lb/>
the first place. And I am not alone in this; I have <lb/>
heard our two knights say the same thing; and a <lb/>
man there in Orleans&#x2014;no, I believe it was at <lb/>
Beaugency, or one of those places&#x2014;it seems more <lb/>
as if it was at Beaugency than the others&#x2014;this man <lb/>
said the same thing exactly; almost the same words; <lb/>
a dark man with a cast in his eye and one leg <lb/>
shorter than the other. His name was&#x2014;was&#x2014;it is <lb/>
singular that I can't call that man's name; I had it <lb/>
in my mind only a moment ago, and I know it be- <lb/>
gins with&#x2014;no, I don't remember what it begins <lb/>
with; but never mind, let it go; I will think of it <lb/>
presently, and then I will tell you.</p>
<p>Well, pretty soon the old father wanted to know <lb/>
how Joan felt when she was in the thick of a battle, <lb/>
with the bright blades hacking and flashing all around <lb/>
her, and the blows rapping and slatting on her shield, <lb/>
and blood gushing on her from the cloven ghastly face <lb/>
and broken teeth of the neighbor at her elbow, and <lb/>
the perilous sudden back surge of massed horses <lb/>
upon a person when the front ranks give way before <lb/>
a heavy rush of the enemy, and men tumble limp <lb/>
and groaning out of saddles all around, and battle- <lb/>
flags falling from dead hands wipe across one's face <lb/>
and hide the tossing turmoil a moment, and in the <lb/>
reeling and swaying and laboring jumble one's horse's <lb/>
hoofs sink into soft substances and shrieks of pain <lb/>
respond, and presently&#x2014;panic! rush! swarm! <lb/>
<pb n="80"/>
flight! and death and hell following after! And <lb/>
the old fellow got ever so much excited; and strode <lb/>
up and down, his tongue going like a mill, asking <lb/>
question after question and never waiting for an <lb/>
answer; and finally he stood Joan up in the middle <lb/>
of the room and stepped off and scanned her crit- <lb/>
cally, and said:</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;I don't understand it. You are so little. <lb/>
So little and slender. When you had your armor <lb/>
on, to-day, it gave one a sort of notion of it; but in <lb/>
these pretty silks and velvets, you are only a dainty <lb/>
page, not a league-striding war-colossus, moving in <lb/>
clouds and darkness and breathing smoke and <lb/>
thunder. I would God I might see you at it and <lb/>
go tell your mother! <i>That</i> would help her sleep, <lb/>
poor thing! Here&#x2014;teach me the arts of the soldier, <lb/>
that I may explain them to her."</p>
<p>And she did it. She gave him a pike, and put him <lb/>
through the manual of arms; and made him do the <lb/>
steps, too. His marching was incredibly awkward <lb/>
and slovenly, and so was his drill with the pike; but <lb/>
he didn't know it, and was wonderfully pleased with <lb/>
himself, and mightily excited and charmed with the <lb/>
ringing, crisp words of command. I am obliged to <lb/>
say that if looking proud and happy when one is <lb/>
marching were sufficient, he would have been the <lb/>
perfect soldier.</p>
<p>And he wanted a lesson in sword-play, and got it. <lb/>
But of course that was beyond him; he was too <lb/>
old. It was beautiful to see Joan handle the foils, <lb/>
<pb n="81"/>
but the old man was a bad failure. He was afraid <lb/>
of the things, and skipped and dodged and scrambled <lb/>
around like a woman who has lost her mind on <lb/>
account of the arrival of a bat. He was of no good <lb/>
as an exhibition. But if La Hire had only come in, <lb/>
that would have been another matter. Those two <lb/>
fenced often; I saw them many times. True, Joan <lb/>
was easily his master, but it made a good show for <lb/>
all that, for La Hire was a grand swordsman. What <lb/>
a swift creature Joan was! You would see her stand- <lb/>
ing erect with her ankle-bones together and her foil <lb/>
arched over her head, the hilt in one hand and the <lb/>
button in the other&#x2014;the old general opposite, bent <lb/>
forward, left hand reposing on his back, his foil <lb/>
advanced, slightly wiggling and squirming, his watch- <lb/>
ing eye boring straight into hers&#x2014;and all of a sud- <lb/>
den she would give a spring forward, and back <lb/>
again; and there she was, with the foil arched over <lb/>
her head as before. La Hire had been hit, but all <lb/>
that the spectator saw of it was a something like a <lb/>
thin flash of light in the air, but nothing distinct, <lb/>
nothing definite.</p>
<p>We kept the drinkables moving, for that would <lb/>
please the Bailly and the landlord; and old Laxart <lb/>
and D'Arc got to feeling quite comfortable, but <lb/>
without being what you could call tipsy. They got <lb/>
out the presents which they had been buying to carry <lb/>
home&#x2014;humble things and cheap, but they would <lb/>
be fine there, and welcome. And they gave to Joan <lb/>
a present from P&#x00E8;re Fronte and one from her mother <lb/>
<pb n="82"/>
&#x2014;the one a little leaden image of the Holy Virgin, <lb/>
the other half a yard of blue silk ribbon; and she <lb/>
was as pleased as a child; and touched, too, as one <lb/>
could see plainly enough. Yes, she kissed those <lb/>
poor things over and over again, as if they had been <lb/>
something costly and wonderful; and she pinned the <lb/>
Virgin on her doublet, and sent for her helmet and <lb/>
tied the ribbon on that; first one way, then another; <lb/>
then a new way, then another new way; and with <lb/>
each effort perching the helmet on her hand and <lb/>
holding it off this way and that, and canting her head <lb/>
to one side and then the other, examining the <lb/>
effect, as a bird does when it has got a new bug. <lb/>
And she said she could almost wish she was going to <lb/>
the wars again; for then she would fight with the <lb/>
better courage, as having always with her something <lb/>
which her mother's touch had blessed.</p>
<p>Old Laxart said he hoped she would go to the <lb/>
wars again, but home first, for that all the people <lb/>
there were cruel anxious to see her&#x2014;and so he <lb/>
went on:</p>
<p>"They are proud of you, dear. Yes, prouder <lb/>
than any village ever was of anybody before. And <lb/>
indeed it is right and rational; for it is the first time <lb/>
a village has ever had anybody like you to be proud <lb/>
of and call its own. And it is strange and beautiful <lb/>
how they try to give your name to every creature <lb/>
that has a sex that is convenient. It is but half a <lb/>
year since you began to be spoken of and left us, <lb/>
and so it is surprising to see how many babies there <lb/>
<pb n="83"/>
are already in that region that are named for you. <lb/>
First it was just Joan; then it was Joan-Orleans; <lb/>
then Joan-Orleans-Beaugency-Patay; and now the <lb/>
next ones will have a lot of towns and the Corona- <lb/>
tion added, of course. Yes, and the animals the <lb/>
same. They know how you love animals, and so <lb/>
they try to do you honor and show their love for <lb/>
you by naming all those creatures after you; inso- <lb/>
much that if a body should step out and call 'Joan <lb/>
of Arc&#x2014;come!' there would be a landslide of cats <lb/>
and all such things, each supposing it was the one <lb/>
wanted, and all willing to take the benefit of the <lb/>
doubt, anyway, for the sake of the food that might <lb/>
be on delivery. The kitten you left behind&#x2014;the <lb/>
last estray you fetched home&#x2014;bears your name, <lb/>
now, and belongs to P&#x00E8;re Fronte, and is the pet and <lb/>
pride of the village; and people have come miles to <lb/>
look at it and pet it and stare at it and wonder over <lb/>
it because it was Joan of Arc's cat. Everybody will <lb/>
tell you that; and one day when a stranger threw a <lb/>
stone at it, not knowing it was your cat, the village <lb/>
rose against him as one man and hanged him! And <lb/>
but for P&#x00E8;re Fronte&#x2014;"</p>
<p>There was an interruption. It was a messenger <lb/>
from the King, bearing a note for Joan, which I read <lb/>
to her, saying he had reflected, and had consulted <lb/>
his other generals, and was obliged to ask her to re- <lb/>
main at the head of the army and withdraw her <lb/>
resignation. Also, would she come immediately and <lb/>
attend a council of war? Straightway, at a little <lb/>
<pb n="84"/>
distance, military commands and the rumble of <lb/>
drums broke on the still night, and we knew that her <lb/>
guard was approaching.</p>
<p>Deep disappointment clouded her face for just one <lb/>
moment and no more&#x2014;it passed, and with it the <lb/>
homesick girl, and she was Joan of Arc, Com- <lb/>
mander-in-Chief again, and ready for duty.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> my double quality of page and secretary I fol- <lb/>
lowed Joan to the council. She entered that pres- <lb/>
ence with the bearing of a grieved goddess. What <lb/>
was become of the volatile child that so lately <lb/>
was enchanted with a ribbon and suffocated with <lb/>
laughter over the distresses of a foolish peasant who <lb/>
had stormed a funeral on the back of a bee-stung <lb/>
bull? One may not guess. Simply it was gone, <lb/>
and had left no sign. She moved straight to the <lb/>
council-table, and stood. Her glance swept from <lb/>
face to face there, and where it fell, these it lit as <lb/>
with a torch, those it scorched as with a brand. She <lb/>
knew where to strike. She indicated the generals <lb/>
with a nod, and said:</p>
<p>"My business is not with you. You have not <lb/>
craved a council of war." Then she turned toward <lb/>
the King's privy council, and continued: "No; it <lb/>
is with you. A council of war! It is amazing. <lb/>
There is but one thing to do, and only one, and <lb/>
lo, ye call a council of war! Councils of war have <lb/>
no value but to decide between two or several doubt- <lb/>
ful courses. But a council of war when there is only <lb/>
<pb n="86"/>
<i>one</i> course? Conceive of a man in a boat and his <lb/>
family in the water, and he goes out among his <lb/>
friends to ask what he would better do? A council <lb/>
of war, name of God! To determine what?"</p>
<p>She stopped, and turned till her eyes rested <lb/>
upon the face of La Tremouille; and so she stood, <lb/>
silent, measuring him, the excitement in all faces <lb/>
burning steadily higher and higher, and all pulses <lb/>
beating faster and faster; then she said, with de- <lb/>
liberation:</p>
<p>"Every sane man&#x2014;whose loyalty to his King is <lb/>
not a show and a pretence&#x2014;knows that there is but <lb/>
one rational thing before us&#x2014;<i>the march upon <lb/>
Paris!</i>"</p>
<p>Down came the fist of La Hire with an approving <lb/>
crash upon the table. La Tremouille turned white <lb/>
with anger, but he pulled himself firmly together and <lb/>
held his peace. The King's lazy blood was stirred <lb/>
and his eye kindled finely, for the spirit of war was <lb/>
away down in him somewhere, and a frank, bold <lb/>
speech always found it and made it tingle gladsomely. <lb/>
Joan waited to see if the chief minister might wish <lb/>
to defend his position; but he was experienced and <lb/>
wise, and not a man to waste his forces where the cur- <lb/>
rent was against him. He would wait; the King's <lb/>
private ear would be at his disposal by and by.</p>
<p>That pious fox the Chancellor of France took the <lb/>
word now. He washed his soft hands together, <lb/>
smiling persuasively, and said to Joan:</p>
<p>"Would it be courteous, your Excellency, to <lb/>
<pb n="87"/>
move abruptly from here without waiting for an <lb/>
answer from the Duke of Burgundy? You may not <lb/>
know that we are negotiating with his Highness, <lb/>
and that there is likely to be a fortnight's truce be- <lb/>
tween us; and on his part a pledge to deliver Paris <lb/>
into our hands without cost of a blow or the fatigue <lb/>
of a march thither."</p>
<p>Joan turned to him and said, gravely:</p>
<p>"This is not a confessional, my lord. You were <lb/>
not obliged to expose that shame here."</p>
<p>The Chancellor's face reddened, and he retorted:</p>
<p>"Shame? What is there shameful about it?"</p>
<p>Joan answered in level, passionless tones:</p>
<p>"One may describe it without hunting far for <lb/>
words. I knew of this poor comedy, my lord, <lb/>
although it was not intended that I should know. It <lb/>
is to the credit of the devisers of it that they tried to <lb/>
conceal it&#x2014;this comedy whose text and impulse <lb/>
are describable in two words."</p>
<p>The Chancellor spoke up with a fine irony in his <lb/>
manner:</p>
<p>"Indeed? And will your Excellency be good <lb/>
enough to utter them?"</p>
<p>"Cowardice and treachery!"</p>
<p>The fists of all the generals came down this time, <lb/>
and again the King's eye sparkled with pleasure. <lb/>
The Chancellor sprang to his feet and appealed to <lb/>
his Majesty:</p>
<p>"Sire, I claim your protection."</p>
<p>But the King waved him to his seat again, saying:</p>
<pb n="88"/>
<p>"Peace. She had a right to be consulted before <lb/>
that thing was undertaken, since it concerned war as <lb/>
well as politics. It is but just that she be heard <lb/>
upon it now."</p>
<p>The Chancellor sat down trembling with indigna- <lb/>
tion, and remarked to Joan:</p>
<p>"Out of charity I will consider that you did not <lb/>
know who devised this measure which you condemn <lb/>
in so candid language."</p>
<p>"Save your charity for another occasion, my <lb/>
lord," said Joan, as calmly as before. "Whenever <lb/>
anything is done to injure the interests and degrade <lb/>
the honor of France, all but the dead know how to <lb/>
name the two conspirators-in-chief&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Sire, sire! this insinuation&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"It is not an insinuation, my lord," said Joan, <lb/>
placidly, "it is a charge. I bring it against the <lb/>
King's chief minister and his Chancellor."</p>
<p>Both men were on their feet now, insisting that <lb/>
the King modify Joan's frankness; but he was not <lb/>
minded to do it. His ordinary councils were stale <lb/>
water&#x2014;his spirit was drinking wine, now, and the <lb/>
taste of it was good. He said:</p>
<p>"Sit&#x2014;and be patient. What is fair for one must <lb/>
in fairness be allowed the other. Consider&#x2014;and be <lb/>
just. When have you two spared her? What dark <lb/>
charges and harsh names have you withheld when <lb/>
you spoke of her?" Then he added, with a veiled <lb/>
twinkle in his eye, "If these are offenses I see no <lb/>
particular difference between them, except that she <lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
says her hard things to your faces, whereas you say <lb/>
yours behind her back."</p>
<p>He was pleased with that neat shot and the way it <lb/>
shriveled those two people up, and made La Hire <lb/>
laugh out loud and the other generals softly quake <lb/>
and chuckle. Joan tranquilly resumed:</p>
<p>"From the first, we have been hindered by this <lb/>
policy of shilly-shally; this fashion of counseling <lb/>
and counseling and counseling where no counseling <lb/>
is needed, but only fighting. We took Orleans on <lb/>
the 8th of May, and could have cleared the region <lb/>
round about in three days and saved the slaughter of <lb/>
Patay. We could have been in Rheims six weeks <lb/>
ago, and in Paris now; and would see the last Eng- <lb/>
lishman pass out of France in half a year. But we <lb/>
struck no blow after Orleans, but went off into the <lb/>
country&#x2014;what for? Ostensibly to hold councils; <lb/>
really to give Bedford time to send reinforcements to <lb/>
Talbot&#x2014;which he did; and Patay had to be fought. <lb/>
After Patay, more counseling, more waste of precious <lb/>
time. Oh, my King, I would that you would be <lb/>
persuaded!" She began to warm up, now. "Once <lb/>
more we have our opportunity. If we rise and <lb/>
strike, all is well. Bid me march upon Paris. In <lb/>
twenty days it shall be yours, and in six months all <lb/>
France! Here is half a year's work before us; if <lb/>
this chance be wasted, I give you twenty years to <lb/>
do it in. Speak the word, O gentle King&#x2014;speak <lb/>
but the one&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I cry you mercy!" interrupted the Chancellor, <lb/>
<pb n="90"/>
who saw a dangerous enthusiasm rising in the King's <lb/>
face. "March upon Paris? Does your Excellency <lb/>
forget that the way bristles with English strong- <lb/>
holds?"</p>
<p>"<i>That</i> for your English strongholds!" and Joan <lb/>
snapped her fingers scornfully. "Whence have we <lb/>
marched in these last days? From Gien. And <lb/>
whither? To Rheims. What bristled between? <lb/>
English strongholds. What are they now? French <lb/>
ones&#x2014;and they never cost a blow!" Here ap- <lb/>
plause broke out from the group of generals, and <lb/>
Joan had to pause a moment to let it subside. <lb/>
"Yes, English strongholds bristled before us; now <lb/>
French ones bristle behind us. What is the argu- <lb/>
ment? A child can read it. The strongholds be- <lb/>
tween us and Paris are garrisoned by no new breed <lb/>
of English, but by the same breed as those others&#x2014; <lb/>
with the same fears, the same questionings, the same <lb/>
weaknesses, the same disposition to see the heavy <lb/>
hand of God descending upon them. We have but <lb/>
to march!&#x2014;on the instant&#x2014;and they are ours, <lb/>
Paris is ours, France is ours! Give the word, O <lb/>
my King, command your servant to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Stay!" cried the Chancellor. "It would be <lb/>
madness to put this affront upon his Highness the <lb/>
Duke of Burgundy. By the treaty which we have <lb/>
every hope to make with him&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, the treaty which we hope to make with him! <lb/>
He has scorned you for years, and defied you. Is <lb/>
it your subtle persuasions that have softened his <lb/>
<pb n="91"/>
manners and beguiled him to listen to proposals? <lb/>
No; it was <i>blows!</i>&#x2014;the blows which <i>we</i> gave him! <lb/>
That is the only teaching that that sturdy rebel can <lb/>
understand. What does he care for <i>wind?</i> The <lb/>
treaty which we hope to make with him&#x2014;alack! <lb/>
<i>He</i> deliver Paris! There is no pauper in the land <lb/>
that is less able to do it. He deliver Paris! Ah, <lb/>
but that would make great Bedford smile! Oh, the <lb/>
pitiful pretext! the blind can see that this thin pour- <lb/>
parler with its fifteen-day truce has no purpose but <lb/>
to give Bedford time to hurry forward his forces <lb/>
against us. More treachery&#x2014;always treachery! <lb/>
We call a council of war&#x2014;with nothing to council <lb/>
about; but Bedford calls no council to teach him <lb/>
what our one course is. He knows what he would <lb/>
do in our place. <i>He would hang his traitors and <lb/>
march upon Paris!</i> O gentle King, rouse! The <lb/>
way is open, Paris beckons, France implores. <lb/>
Speak and we&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Sire, it is madness, sheer madness! Your Ex- <lb/>
cellency, we cannot, we must not go back from what <lb/>
we have done; we have proposed to treat, we <i>must</i> <lb/>
treat with the Duke of Burgundy."</p>
<p>"And we <i>will?</i> said Joan.</p>
<p>"Ah? How?"</p>
<p>"<i>At the point of the lance!</i>"</p>
<p>The house rose, to a man&#x2014;all that had French <lb/>
hearts&#x2014;and let go a crash of applause&#x2014;and kept <lb/>
it up; and in the midst of it one heard La Hire <lb/>
growl out: "At the point of the lance! By God, <lb/>
<pb n="92"/>
that is the music!" The King was up, too, and drew <lb/>
his sword, and took it by the blade and strode to <lb/>
Joan and delivered the hilt of it into her hand, <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"There, the King surrenders. Carry it to Paris."</p>
<p>And so the applause burst out again, and the <lb/>
historical council of war that has bred so many <lb/>
legends was over.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXXIX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was away past midnight, and had been a tre- <lb/>
mendous day in the matter of excitement and <lb/>
fatigue, but that was no matter to Joan when there <lb/>
was business on hand. She did not think of bed. <lb/>
The generals followed her to her official quarters, <lb/>
and she delivered her orders to them as fast as she <lb/>
could talk, and they sent them off to their different <lb/>
commands as fast as delivered; wherefore the mes- <lb/>
sengers galloping hither and thither raised a world of <lb/>
clatter and racket in the still streets; and soon were <lb/>
added to this the music of distant bugles and the roll <lb/>
of drums&#x2014;notes of preparation; for the vanguard <lb/>
would break camp at dawn.</p>
<p>The generals were soon dismissed, but I wasn't; <lb/>
nor Joan; for it was my turn to work, now. Joan <lb/>
walked the floor and dictated a summons to the <lb/>
Duke of Burgundy to lay down his arms and make <lb/>
peace and exchange pardons with the King; or, if <lb/>
he <i>must</i> fight, go fight the Saracens. "Pardonnez- <lb/>
vous l'un &#x00E0; l'autre de bon c&#x0153;ur, enti&#x00E8;rement, ainsi <lb/>
que doivent faire loyaux chr&#x00E9;tiens, et, s'il vous plait <lb/>
de guerroyer, allez contre les Sarrasins." It was <lb/>
<pb n="94"/>
long, but it was good, and had the sterling ring to it. <lb/>
It is my opinion that it was as fine and simple and <lb/>
straightforward and eloquent a state paper as she <lb/>
ever uttered.</p>
<p>It was delivered into the hands of a courier, and <lb/>
he galloped away with it. Then Joan dismissed me, <lb/>
and told me to go to the inn and stay, and in the <lb/>
morning give to her father the parcel which she had <lb/>
left there. It contained presents for the Domremy <lb/>
relatives and friends and a peasant dress which she <lb/>
had bought for herself. She said she would say <lb/>
good-bye to her father and uncle in the morning if it <lb/>
should still be their purpose to go, instead of tarry- <lb/>
ing awhile to see the city.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, of course: but I could have <lb/>
said that wild horses couldn't keep those men in that <lb/>
town half a day. <i>They</i> waste the glory of being the <lb/>
first to carry the great news to Domremy&#x2014;<i>the taxes <lb/>
remitted forever!</i>&#x2014;and hear the bells clang and clat- <lb/>
ter, and the people cheer and shout? Oh, not they. <lb/>
Patay and Orleans and the Coronation were events <lb/>
which in a vague way these men understood to be <lb/>
colossal; but they were colossal mists, films, abstrac- <lb/>
tions: <i>this</i> was a gigantic reality!</p>
<p>When I got there, do you suppose they were abed! <lb/>
Quite the reverse. They and the rest were as mel- <lb/>
low as mellow could be; and the Paladin was doing <lb/>
his battles over in great style, and the old peasants <lb/>
were endangering the building with their applause. <lb/>
He was doing Patay now; and was bending his big <lb/>
<pb n="95"/>
frame forward and laying out the positions and <lb/>
movements with a rake here and a rake there of his <lb/>
formidable sword on the floor, and the peasants were <lb/>
stooped over with their hands on their spread knees <lb/>
observing with excited eyes and ripping out ejacula- <lb/>
tions of wonder and admiration all along:</p>
<p>"Yes, here we were, waiting&#x2014;waiting for the <lb/>
word; our horses fidgeting and snorting and danc- <lb/>
ing to get away, we lying back on the bridles till our <lb/>
bodies fairly slanted to the rear; the word rang out <lb/>
at last&#x2014;'<i>Go!</i>' and we went!</p>
<p>"Went? There was nothing like it ever seen! <lb/>
Where we swept by squads of scampering English, <lb/>
the mere wind of our passage laid them flat in piles <lb/>
and rows! Then we plunged into the ruck of <lb/>
Fastolfe's frantic battle-corps and tore through it like <lb/>
a hurricane, leaving a causeway of the dead stretch- <lb/>
ing far behind; no tarrying, no slacking rein, but <lb/>
on! on! on! far yonder in the distance lay <i>our</i> <lb/>
prey&#x2014;Talbot and his host looming vast and dark <lb/>
like a storm-cloud brooding on the sea! Down we <lb/>
swooped upon them, glooming all the air with a <lb/>
quivering pall of dead leaves flung up by the whirl- <lb/>
wind of our flight. In another moment we should <lb/>
have struck them as world strikes world when disor- <lb/>
bited constellations crash into the Milky Way, but by <lb/>
misfortune and the inscrutable dispensation of God I <lb/>
was recognized! Talbot turned white, and shouting, <lb/>
'Save yourselves, it is the Standard-Bearer of Joan <lb/>
of Arc!' drove his spurs home till they met in the <lb/>
<pb n="96"/>
middle of his horse's entrails, and fled the field with <lb/>
his billowing multitudes at his back! I could have <lb/>
cursed myself for not putting on a disguise. I saw <lb/>
reproach in the eyes of her Excellency, and was bit- <lb/>
terly ashamed. I had caused what seemed an irre- <lb/>
parable disaster. Another might have gone aside to <lb/>
grieve, as not seeing any way to mend it; but I <lb/>
thank God I am not of those. Great occasions <lb/>
only summon as with a trumpet-call the slumbering <lb/>
reserves of my intellect. I saw my opportunity in <lb/>
an instant&#x2014;in the next I was away! Through the <lb/>
woods I vanished&#x2014;<i>fst!</i>&#x2014;like an extinguished <lb/>
light! Away around through the curtaining forest I <lb/>
sped, as if on wings, none knowing what was become <lb/>
of me, none suspecting my design. Minute after <lb/>
minute passed, on and on I flew; on, and still on; <lb/>
and at last with a great cheer I flung my Banner to <lb/>
the breeze and burst out in <i>front</i> of Talbot! Oh, it <lb/>
was a mighty thought! That weltering chaos of dis- <lb/>
tracted men whirled and surged backward like a tidal <lb/>
wave which has struck a continent, and the day was <lb/>
ours! Poor helpless creatures, they were in a trap; <lb/>
they were surrounded; they could not escape to the <lb/>
rear, for there was our army; they could not escape <lb/>
to the front, for there was I. Their hearts shriveled <lb/>
in their bodies, their hands fell listless at their sides. <lb/>
They stood still, and at our leisure we slaughtered <lb/>
them to a man; all except Talbot and Fastolfe, <lb/>
whom I saved and brought away, one under each <lb/>
arm."</p>
<pb n="97"/>
<p>Well, there is no denying it, the Paladin was in <lb/>
great form that night. Such style! such noble <lb/>
grace of gesture, such grandeur of attitude, such <lb/>
energy when he got going! such steady rise, on <lb/>
such sure wing, such nicely graduated expenditures <lb/>
of voice according to weight of matter, such skillfully <lb/>
calculated approaches to his surprises and explosions, <lb/>
such belief-compelling sincerity of tone and manner, <lb/>
such a climaxing peal from his brazen lungs, and <lb/>
such a lightning-vivid picture of his mailed form <lb/>
and flaunting banner when he burst out before that <lb/>
despairing army! And oh, the gentle art of the last <lb/>
half of his last sentence&#x2014;delivered in the careless <lb/>
and indolent tone of one who has finished his real <lb/>
story, and only adds a colorless and inconsequential <lb/>
detail because it has happened to occur to him in a <lb/>
lazy way.</p>
<p>It was a marvel to see those innocent peasants. <lb/>
Why, they went all to pieces with enthusiasm, and <lb/>
roared out applauses fit to raise the roof and wake <lb/>
the dead. When they had cooled down at last and <lb/>
there was silence but for the heaving and panting, <lb/>
old Laxart said, admiringly:</p>
<p>"As it seems to me, you are an army in your <lb/>
single person."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is what he is," said No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson, <lb/>
convincingly. "He is a terror; and not just in <i>this</i> <lb/>
vicinity. His mere name carries a shudder with it to <lb/>
distant lands&#x2014;just his mere name; and when he <lb/>
frowns, the shadow of it falls as far as Rome, and <lb/>
<pb n="98"/>
the chickens go to roost an hour before schedule <lb/>
time. Yes; and some say&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson, you are preparing yourself <lb/>
for trouble. I will say just one word to you, and it <lb/>
will be to your advantage to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>I saw that the usual thing had got a start. No <lb/>
man could prophesy when it would end. So I de- <lb/>
livered Joan's message and went off to bed.</p>
<p>Joan made her good-byes to those old fellows in <lb/>
the morning, with loving embraces and many tears, <lb/>
and with a packed multitude for sympathizers, and <lb/>
they rode proudly away on their precious horses to <lb/>
carry their great news home. I had seen better <lb/>
riders, I will say that; for horsemanship was a new <lb/>
art to them.</p>
<p>The vanguard moved out at dawn and took the road, <lb/>
with bands braying and banners flying; the second <lb/>
division followed at eight. Then came the Bur- <lb/>
gundian ambassadors, and lost us the rest of that day <lb/>
and the whole of the next. But Joan was on hand, <lb/>
and so they had their journey for their pains. The <lb/>
rest of us took the road at dawn, next morning, July <lb/>
20th. And got how far? Six leagues. Tremouille <lb/>
was getting in his sly work with the vacillating King, <lb/>
you see. The King stopped at St. Marcoul and <lb/>
prayed three days. Precious time lost&#x2014;for us; <lb/>
precious time gained for Bedford. He would know <lb/>
how to use it.</p>
<p>We could not go on without the King; that would <lb/>
be to leave him in the conspirators' camp. Joan <lb/>
<pb n="99"/>
argued, reasoned, implored; and at last we got <lb/>
under way again.</p>
<p>Joan's prediction was verified. It was not a <lb/>
campaign, it was only another holiday excursion. <lb/>
English strongholds lined our route; they surren- <lb/>
dered without a blow; we garrisoned them with <lb/>
Frenchmen and passed on. Bedford was on the <lb/>
march against us with his new army by this time, and <lb/>
on the 25th of July the hostile forces faced each <lb/>
other and made preparation for battle; but Bedford's <lb/>
good judgment prevailed, and he turned and retreated <lb/>
toward Paris. Now was our chance. Our men <lb/>
were in great spirits.</p>
<p>Will you believe it? Our poor stick of a King al- <lb/>
lowed his worthless advisers to persuade him to start <lb/>
back for Gien, whence he had set out when we first <lb/>
marched for Rheims and the Coronation! And we <lb/>
actually did start back. The fifteen-day truce had <lb/>
just been concluded with the Duke of Burgundy, <lb/>
and we would go and tarry at Gien until he should <lb/>
deliver Paris to us without a fight.</p>
<p>We marched to Bray; then the King changed his <lb/>
mind once more, and with it his face toward Paris. <lb/>
Joan dictated a letter to the citizens of Rheims to <lb/>
encourage them to keep heart in spite of the truce, <lb/>
and promising to stand by them. She furnished <lb/>
them the news herself that the King had made this <lb/>
truce; and in speaking of it she was her usual frank <lb/>
self. She said she was not satisfied with it, and <lb/>
didn't know whether she would keep it or not; that <lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
if she kept it, it would be solely out of tenderness <lb/>
for the King's honor. All French children know <lb/>
those famous words. How na&#x00EF;ve they are! "De <lb/>
cette tr&#x00E8;ve qui a &#x00E9;t&#x00E9; faite, je ne suis pas contente, et <lb/>
je ne sais si je la tiendrai. Si je la tiens, ce sera <lb/>
seulement pour garder l'honneur du roi." But in <lb/>
any case, she said, she would not allow the blood <lb/>
royal to be abused, and would keep the army in <lb/>
good order and ready for work at the end of the <lb/>
truce.</p>
<p>Poor child, to have to fight England, Burgundy, <lb/>
and a French conspiracy all at the same time&#x2014;it <lb/>
was too bad. She was a match for the others, but a <lb/>
conspiracy&#x2014;ah, nobody is a match for that, when <lb/>
the victim that is to be injured is weak and willing. <lb/>
It grieved her, these troubled days, to be so hindered <lb/>
and delayed and baffled, and at times she was sad <lb/>
and the tears lay near the surface. Once, talking <lb/>
with her good old faithful friend and servant, the <lb/>
Bastard of Orleans, she said:</p>
<p>"Ah, if it might but please God to let me put off <lb/>
this steel raiment and go back to my father and my <lb/>
mother, and tend my sheep again with my sister and <lb/>
my brothers, who would be so glad to see me!"</p>
<p>By the 12th of August we were camped near <lb/>
Dampmartin. Later we had a brush with Bedford's <lb/>
rear-guard, and had hopes of a big battle on the <lb/>
morrow, but Bedford and all his force got away in <lb/>
the night and went on toward Paris.</p>
<p>Charles sent heralds and received the submission <lb/>
<pb n="101"/>
of Beauvais. The Bishop Pierre Cauchon, that <lb/>
faithful friend and slave of the English, was not able <lb/>
to prevent it, though he did his best. He was <lb/>
obscure then, but his name was to travel round the <lb/>
globe presently, and live forever in the curses of <lb/>
France! Bear with me now, while I spit in fancy <lb/>
upon his grave.</p>
<p>Compi&#x00E8;gne surrendered, and hauled down the <lb/>
English flag. On the 14th we camped two leagues <lb/>
from Senlis. Bedford turned and approached, and <lb/>
took up a strong position. We went against him, <lb/>
but all our efforts to beguile him out from his <lb/>
entrenchments failed, though he had promised us a <lb/>
duel in the open field. Night shut down. Let him <lb/>
look out for the morning! But in the morning he <lb/>
was gone again.</p>
<p>We entered Compi&#x00E8;gne the 18th of August, turn- <lb/>
ing out the English garrison and hoisting our own flag.</p>
<p>On the 23d Joan gave command to move upon <lb/>
Paris. The King and the clique were not satisfied <lb/>
with this, and retired sulking to Senlis, which had <lb/>
just surrendered. Within a few days many strong <lb/>
places submitted&#x2014;Creil, Pont-Saint-Maxence, <lb/>
Choisy, Gournay-sur-Aronde, Remy, La Neufville- <lb/>
en-Hez, Moguay, Chantilly, Saintines. The English <lb/>
power was tumbling, crash after crash! And still <lb/>
the King sulked and disapproved, and was afraid of <lb/>
our movement against the capital.</p>
<p>On the 26th of August, 1429, Joan camped at <lb/>
Saint Denis; in effect, under the walls of Paris.</p>
<pb n="102"/>
<p>And still the King hung back and was afraid. If <lb/>
we could but have had him there to back us with his <lb/>
authority! Bedford had lost heart and decided to <lb/>
waive resistance and go and concentrate his strength <lb/>
in the best and loyalest province remaining to him <lb/>
&#x2014;Normandy. Ah, if we could only have persuaded <lb/>
the King to come and countenance us with his pres- <lb/>
ence and approval at this supreme moment!</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XL">
<pb n="103"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XL.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Courier</smcap> after courier was despatched to the <lb/>
King, and he promised to come, but didn't. <lb/>
The Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on went to him and got his promise <lb/>
again, which he broke again. Nine days were lost <lb/>
thus; then he came, arriving at St. Denis September <lb/>
7th.</p>
<p>Meantime the enemy had begun to take heart: the <lb/>
spiritless conduct of the King could have no other <lb/>
result. Preparations had now been made to de- <lb/>
fend the city. Joan's chances had been diminished, <lb/>
but she and her generals considered them plenty <lb/>
good enough yet. Joan ordered the attack for eight <lb/>
o'clock next morning, and at that hour it began.</p>
<p>Joan placed her artillery and began to pound a <lb/>
strong work which protected the gate St. Honor&#x00E9;. <lb/>
When it was sufficiently crippled the assault was <lb/>
sounded at noon, and it was carried by storm. Then <lb/>
we moved forward to storm the gate itself, and hurled <lb/>
ourselves against it again and again, Joan in the lead <lb/>
with her standard at her side, the smoke enveloping <lb/>
us in choking clouds, and the missiles flying over us <lb/>
and through us as thick as hail.</p>
<p>In the midst of our last assault, which would have <lb/>
<pb n="104"/>
carried the gate sure and given us Paris and in effect <lb/>
France, Joan was struck down by a crossbow bolt, <lb/>
and our men fell back instantly and almost in a panic <lb/>
&#x2014;for what were they without her? <i>She</i> was the <lb/>
army, herself.</p>
<p>Although disabled, she refused to retire, and <lb/>
begged that a new assault be made, saying it <i>must</i> <lb/>
win; and adding, with the battle-light rising in her <lb/>
eyes, "I will take Paris now or die!" She had to <lb/>
be carried away by force, and this was done by <lb/>
Gaucourt and the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on.</p>
<p>But her spirits were at the very top notch, now. <lb/>
She was brimming with enthusiasm. She said she <lb/>
would be carried before the gate in the morning, and <lb/>
in half an hour Paris would be ours without any ques- <lb/>
tion. She could have kept her word. About this <lb/>
there was no doubt. But she forgot one factor&#x2014; <lb/>
the King, shadow of that substance named La Tre- <lb/>
mouille. The King forbade the attempt!</p>
<p>You see, a new Embassy had just come from the <lb/>
Duke of Burgundy, and another sham private trade <lb/>
of some sort was on foot.</p>
<p>You would know, without my telling you, that <lb/>
Joan's heart was nearly broken. Because of the pain <lb/>
of her wound and the pain at her heart she slept little <lb/>
that night. Several times the watchers heard muffled <lb/>
sobs from the dark room where she lay at St. Denis, <lb/>
and many times the grieving words "It could have <lb/>
been taken!&#x2014;it could have been taken!" which <lb/>
were the only ones she said.</p>
<pb n="105"/>
<p>She dragged herself out of bed a day later with a <lb/>
new hope. D'Alen&#x00E7;on had thrown a bridge across <lb/>
the Seine near St. Denis. Might she not cross by <lb/>
that and assault Paris at another point? But the <lb/>
King got wind of it and broke the bridge down! <lb/>
And more&#x2014;he declared the campaign ended! And <lb/>
more still&#x2014;he had made a new truce and a long <lb/>
one, in which he had agreed to leave Paris unthreat- <lb/>
ened and unmolested, and go back to the Loire <lb/>
whence he had come!</p>
<p>Joan of Arc, who had never been defeated by the <lb/>
enemy, was defeated by her own King. She had <lb/>
said once that all she feared for her cause was <lb/>
treachery. It had struck its first blow now. She <lb/>
hung up her white armor in the royal basilica of St. <lb/>
Denis, and went and asked the King to relieve her <lb/>
of her functions and let her go home. As usual, <lb/>
she was wise. Grand combinations, far-reaching <lb/>
great military moves were at an end, now; for the <lb/>
future, when the truce should end, the war would be <lb/>
merely a war of random and idle skirmishes, appar- <lb/>
ently; work suitable for subalterns, and not requiring <lb/>
the supervision of a sublime military genius. But <lb/>
the King would not let her go. The truce did not <lb/>
embrace all France; there were French strongholds <lb/>
to be watched and preserved; he would need her. <lb/>
Really you see, Tremouille wanted to keep her <lb/>
where he could balk and hinder her.</p>
<p>Now came her Voices again. They said, "<i>Re- <lb/>
main at St. Denis</i>." There was no explanation. <lb/>
<pb n="106"/>
They did not say why. That was the voice of God; <lb/>
it took precedence of the command of the King; <lb/>
Joan resolved to stay. But that filled La Tremouille <lb/>
with dread. She was too tremendous a force to be <lb/>
left to herself; she would surely defeat all his plans. <lb/>
He beguiled the King to use compulsion. Joan had <lb/>
to submit&#x2014;because she was wounded and helpless. <lb/>
In the Great Trial she said she was carried away <lb/>
against her will; and that if she had not been <lb/>
wounded it could not have been accomplished. Ah, <lb/>
she had a spirit, that slender girl! a spirit to brave <lb/>
all earthly powers and defy them. We shall never <lb/>
know why the Voices ordered her to stay. We only <lb/>
know this: that if she could have obeyed, the history <lb/>
of France would not be as it now stands written in <lb/>
the books. Yes, well we know that.</p>
<p>On the 13th of September the army, sad and <lb/>
spiritless, turned its face toward the Loire, and <lb/>
marched&#x2014;without music! Yes, one noted that <lb/>
detail. It was a funeral march; that is what it was. <lb/>
A long, dreary funeral march, with never a shout <lb/>
or a cheer; friends looking on in tears, all the way, <lb/>
enemies laughing. We reached Gien at last&#x2014;that <lb/>
place whence we had set out on our splendid march <lb/>
toward Rheims less than three months before, with <lb/>
flags flying, bands playing, the victory-flush of Patay <lb/>
glowing in our faces, and the massed multitudes <lb/>
shouting and praising and giving us God-speed. <lb/>
There was a dull rain falling now, the day was <lb/>
dark, the heavens mourned, the spectators were few, <lb/>
<pb n="107"/>
we had no welcome but the welcome of silence, and <lb/>
pity, and tears.</p>
<p>Then the King disbanded that noble army of <lb/>
heroes; it furled its flags, it stored its arms: the dis- <lb/>
grace of France was complete. La Tremouille wore <lb/>
the victor's crown; Joan of Arc, the unconquerable, <lb/>
was conquered.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XLI">
<pb n="108"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XLI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Yes</smcap>, it was as I have said: Joan had Paris and <lb/>
France in her grip, and the Hundred Years' <lb/>
War under her heel, and the King made her open <lb/>
her fist and take away her foot.</p>
<p>Now followed about eight months of drifting <lb/>
about with the King and his council, and his gay <lb/>
and showy and dancing and flirting and hawking <lb/>
and frolicking and serenading and dissipating court <lb/>
&#x2014;drifting from town to town and from castle to <lb/>
castle&#x2014;a life which was pleasant to us of the per- <lb/>
sonal staff, but not to Joan. However, she only <lb/>
<i>saw</i> it, she didn't live it. The King did his sin- <lb/>
cerest best to make her happy, and showed a most <lb/>
kind and constant anxiety in this matter. All others <lb/>
had to go loaded with the chains of an exacting <lb/>
court etiquette, but she was free, she was privileged. <lb/>
So that she paid her duty to the King once a day <lb/>
and passed the pleasant word, nothing further was <lb/>
required of her. Naturally, then, she made herself <lb/>
a hermit, and grieved the weary days through in her <lb/>
own apartments, with her thoughts and devotions <lb/>
for company, and the planning of now forever un- <lb/>
<pb n="109"/>
realizable military combinations for entertainment. <lb/>
In fancy she moved bodies of men from this and <lb/>
that and the other point, so calculating the dis- <lb/>
tances to be covered, the time required for each <lb/>
body, and the nature of the country to be traversed, <lb/>
as to have them appear in sight of each other on a <lb/>
given day or at a given hour and concentrate for <lb/>
battle. It was her only game, her only relief from <lb/>
her burden of sorrow and inaction. She played it <lb/>
hour after hour, as others play chess; and lost her- <lb/>
self in it, and so got repose for her mind and heal- <lb/>
ing for her heart.</p>
<p>She never complained, of course. It was not her <lb/>
way. She was the sort that endure in silence. <lb/>
But&#x2014;she was a caged eagle just the same, and <lb/>
pined for the free air and the alpine heights and the <lb/>
fierce joys of the storm.</p>
<p>France was full of rovers&#x2014;disbanded soldiers <lb/>
ready for anything that might turn up. Several <lb/>
times, at intervals, when Joan's dull captivity grew <lb/>
too heavy to bear, she was allowed to gather a troop <lb/>
of cavalry and make a health-restoring dash against <lb/>
the enemy. These things were like a bath to her <lb/>
spirits.</p>
<p>It was like old times, there at Saint-Pierre-le- <lb/>
Moutier, to see her lead assault after assault, be <lb/>
driven back again and again, but always rally and <lb/>
charge anew, all in a blaze of eagerness and delight; <lb/>
till at last the tempest of missiles rained so intoler- <lb/>
ably thick that old D'Aulon, who was wounded, <lb/>
<pb n="110"/>
sounded the retreat (for the King had charged him <lb/>
on his head to let no harm come to Joan); and <lb/>
away everybody rushed after him&#x2014;as he supposed; <lb/>
but when he turned and looked, there were we of <lb/>
the staff still hammering away; wherefore he rode <lb/>
back and urged her to come, saying she was mad to <lb/>
stay there with only a dozen men. Her eye danced <lb/>
merrily, and she turned upon him crying out:</p>
<p>"A dozen men! name of God, I have fifty thou- <lb/>
sand, and will never budge till this place is taken! <lb/>
Sound the charge!"</p>
<p>Which he did, and over the walls we went, and <lb/>
the fortress was ours. Old D'Aulon thought her <lb/>
mind was wandering; but all she meant was, that <lb/>
she felt the might of fifty thousand men surging in <lb/>
her heart. It was a fanciful expression; but, to my <lb/>
thinking, truer word was never said.</p>
<p>Then there was the affair near Lagny, where we <lb/>
charged the intrenched Burgundians through the <lb/>
open field four times, the last time victoriously; the <lb/>
best prize of it Franquet d'Arras, the freebooter and <lb/>
pitiless scourge of the region roundabout.</p>
<p>Now and then other such affairs; and at last, <lb/>
away toward the end of May, 1430, we were in the <lb/>
neighborhood of Compi&#x00E8;gne, and Joan resolved to <lb/>
go to the help of that place, which was being be- <lb/>
sieged by the Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p>I had been wounded lately, and was not able to <lb/>
ride without help; but the good Dwarf took me on <lb/>
behind him, and I held on to him and was safe <lb/>
<pb n="111"/>
enough. We started at midnight, in a sullen down- <lb/>
pour of warm rain, and went slowly and softly and <lb/>
in dead silence, for we had to slip through the <lb/>
enemy's lines. We were challenged only once; we <lb/>
made no answer, but held our breath and crept <lb/>
steadily and stealthily along, and got through with- <lb/>
out any accident. About three or half past we <lb/>
reached Compi&#x00E8;gne, just as the gray dawn was <lb/>
breaking in the East.</p>
<p>Joan set to work at once, and concerted a plan <lb/>
with Guillaume de Flavy, captain of the city&#x2014;a <lb/>
plan for a sortie toward evening against the enemy, <lb/>
who was posted in three bodies on the other side of <lb/>
the Oise, in the level plain. From our side one of <lb/>
the city gates communicated with a bridge. The <lb/>
end of this bridge was defended on the other side of <lb/>
the river by one of those fortresses called a boule- <lb/>
vard; and this boulevard also commanded a raised <lb/>
road, which stretched from its front across the plain <lb/>
to the village of Marguy. A force of Burgundians <lb/>
occupied Marguy; another was camped at Clairoix, <lb/>
a couple of miles <i>above</i> the raised road; and a body <lb/>
of English was holding Venette, a mile and a half <lb/>
<i>below</i> it. A kind of bow-and-arrow arrangement, <lb/>
you see: the causeway the arrow, the boulevard at <lb/>
the feather-end of it, Marguy at the barb, Venette <lb/>
at one end of the bow, Clairoix at the other.</p>
<p>Joan's plan was to go straight per causeway <lb/>
against Marguy, carry it by assault, then turn swiftly <lb/>
upon Clairoix, up to the right, and capture that <lb/>
<pb n="112"/>
camp in the same way, then face to the rear and be <lb/>
ready for heavy work, for the Duke of Burgundy <lb/>
lay behind Clairoix with a reserve. Flavy's lieu- <lb/>
tenant, with archers and the artillery of the boule- <lb/>
vard, was to keep the English troops from coming <lb/>
up from below and seizing the causeway and cutting <lb/>
off Joan's retreat in case she should have to make <lb/>
one. Also, a fleet of covered boats was to be <lb/>
stationed near the boulevard as an additional help <lb/>
in case a retreat should become necessary.</p>
<p>It was the 24th of May. At four in the afternoon <lb/>
Joan moved out at the head of six hundred cavalry <lb/>
&#x2014;on her last march in this life!</p>
<p>It breaks my heart. I had got myself helped up <lb/>
on to the walls, and from there I saw much that <lb/>
happened, the rest was told me long afterward by <lb/>
our two knights and other eye-witnesses. Joan <lb/>
crossed the bridge, and soon left the boulevard be- <lb/>
hind her and went skimming away over the raised <lb/>
road with her horsemen clattering at her heels. She <lb/>
had on a brilliant silver-gilt cape over her armor, <lb/>
and I could see it flap and flare and rise and fall like <lb/>
a little patch of white flame.</p>
<p>It was a bright day, and one could see far and <lb/>
wide over that plain. Soon we saw the English <lb/>
force advancing, swiftly and in handsome order, the <lb/>
sunlight flashing from its arms.</p>
<p>Joan crashed into the Burgundians at Marguy and <lb/>
was repulsed. Then she saw the other Burgundians <lb/>
moving down from Clairoix. Joan rallied her men <lb/>
<pb n="113"/>
and charged again, and was again rolled back. Two <lb/>
assaults occupy a good deal of time&#x2014;and time was <lb/>
precious here. The English were approaching the <lb/>
road now from Venette, but the boulevard opened <lb/>
fire on them and they were checked. Joan heart- <lb/>
ened her men with inspiring words and led them to <lb/>
the charge again in great style. This time she car- <lb/>
ried Marguy with a hurrah. Then she turned at <lb/>
once to the right and plunged into the plain and <lb/>
struck the Clairoix force, which was just arriving; <lb/>
then there was heavy work, and plenty of it, the <lb/>
two armies hurling each other backward turn about <lb/>
and about, and victory inclining first to the one, <lb/>
then to the other. Now all of a sudden there was a <lb/>
panic on our side. Some say one thing caused it, <lb/>
some another. Some say the cannonade made our <lb/>
front ranks think retreat was being cut off by the <lb/>
English, some say the rear ranks got the idea that <lb/>
Joan was killed. Anyway our men broke, and went <lb/>
flying in a wild rout for the causeway. Joan tried <lb/>
to rally them and face them around, crying to them <lb/>
that victory was sure, but it did no good, they <lb/>
divided and swept by her like a wave. Old D'Aulon <lb/>
begged her to retreat while there was yet a chance <lb/>
for safety, but she refused; so he seized her horse's <lb/>
bridle and bore her along with the wreck and ruin in <lb/>
spite of herself. And so along the causeway they <lb/>
came swarming, that wild confusion of frenzied men <lb/>
and horses&#x2014;and the artillery had to stop firing, of <lb/>
course; consequently the English and Burgundians <lb/>
<pb n="114"/>
closed in in safety, the former in front, the latter <lb/>
behind their prey. Clear to the boulevard the <lb/>
French were washed in this enveloping inundation; <lb/>
and there, cornered in an angle formed by the flank <lb/>
of the boulevard and the slope of the causeway, <lb/>
they bravely fought a hopeless fight, and sank down <lb/>
one by one.</p>
<p>Flavy, watching from the city wall, ordered the <lb/>
gate to be closed and the drawbridge raised. This <lb/>
shut Joan out.</p>
<p>The little personal guard around her thinned <lb/>
swiftly. Both of our good knights went down dis- <lb/>
abled; Joan's two brothers fell wounded; then No&#x00EB;l <lb/>
Rainguesson&#x2014;all wounded while loyally sheltering <lb/>
Joan from blows aimed at her. When only the <lb/>
Dwarf and the Paladin were left, they would not <lb/>
give up, but stood their ground stoutly, a pair of <lb/>
steel towers streaked and splashed with blood; and <lb/>
where the axe of the one fell, and the sword of the <lb/>
other, an enemy gasped and died. And so fighting, <lb/>
and loyal to their duty to the last, good simple <lb/>
souls, they came to their honorable end. Peace to <lb/>
their memories! they were very dear to me.</p>
<p>Then there was a cheer and a rush, and Joan, still <lb/>
defiant, still laying about her with her sword, was <lb/>
seized by her cape and dragged from her horse. <lb/>
She was borne away a prisoner to the Duke of <lb/>
Burgundy's camp, and after her followed the victori- <lb/>
ous army roaring its joy.</p>
<p>The awful news started instantly on its round; <lb/>
<pb n="115"/>
from lip to lip it flew; and wherever it came it <lb/>
struck the people as with a sort of paralysis; and <lb/>
they murmured over and over again, as if they were <lb/>
talking to themselves, or in their sleep, "The Maid <lb/>
of Orleans taken!&#x2026;&#x2026;Joan of Arc a prisoner! <lb/>
&#x2026;&#x2026;the Saviour of France lost to us!"&#x2014;and <lb/>
would keep saying that over, as if they couldn't <lb/>
understand how it could be, or how God could per- <lb/>
mit it, poor creatures!</p>
<p>You know what a city is like when it is hung from <lb/>
eaves to pavement with rustling black? Then you <lb/>
know what Tours was like, and some other cities. <lb/>
But can any man tell you what the mourning in the <lb/>
hearts of the peasantry of France was like? No, <lb/>
nobody can tell you that, and, poor dumb things, <lb/>
they could not have told you themselves, but it was <lb/>
there&#x2014;indeed, yes. Why, it was the spirit of a <lb/>
whole nation hung with crape!</p>
<p>The 24th of May. We will draw down the curtain <lb/>
now upon the most strange, and pathetic, and won- <lb/>
derful military drama that has been played upon the <lb/>
stage of the world. Joan of Arc will march no <lb/>
more.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER I.</b></head>
<p><smcap>I cannot</smcap> bear to dwell at great length upon the <lb/>
shameful history of the summer and winter fol- <lb/>
lowing the capture. For a while I was not much <lb/>
troubled, for I was expecting every day to hear that <lb/>
Joan had been put to ransom, and that the King&#x2014; <lb/>
no, not the King, but grateful France&#x2014;had come <lb/>
eagerly forward to pay it. By the laws of war she <lb/>
could not be denied the privilege of ransom. She <lb/>
was not a rebel; she was a legitimately constituted <lb/>
soldier, head of the armies of France by her King's <lb/>
appointment, and guilty of no crime known to mili- <lb/>
tary law; therefore she could not be detained upon <lb/>
any pretext, if ransom were proffered.</p>
<p>But day after day dragged by and no ransom was <lb/>
offered! It seems incredible, but it is true. Was <lb/>
that reptile Tremouille busy at the King's ear? All <lb/>
we know is, that the King was silent, and made no <lb/>
offer and no effort in behalf of this poor girl who <lb/>
had done so much for him.</p>
<p>But, unhappily, there was alacrity enough in an- <lb/>
other quarter. The news of the capture reached <lb/>
Paris the day after it happened, and the glad Eng- <lb/>
<pb n="120"/>
lish and Burgundians deafened the world all the day <lb/>
and all the night with the clamor of their joy-bells <lb/>
and the thankful thunder of their artillery, and the <lb/>
next day the Vicar-General of the Inquisition sent <lb/>
a message to the Duke of Burgundy requiring the <lb/>
delivery of the prisoner into the hands of the Church <lb/>
to be tried as an idolater.</p>
<p>The English had seen their opportunity, and it <lb/>
was the English power that was really acting, not <lb/>
the Church. The Church was being used as a blind, <lb/>
a disguise; and for a forcible reason: the Church <lb/>
was not only able to take the life of Joan of Arc, <lb/>
but to blight her influence and the valor-breeding <lb/>
inspiration of her name, whereas the English power <lb/>
could but kill her body; that would not diminish or <lb/>
destroy the influence of her name; it would magnify <lb/>
it and make it permanent. Joan of Arc was the <lb/>
only power in France that the English did not de- <lb/>
spise, the only power in France that they considered <lb/>
formidable. If the Church could be brought to take <lb/>
her life, or to proclaim her an idolater, a heretic, a <lb/>
witch, sent from Satan, not from heaven, it was be- <lb/>
lieved that the English supremacy could be at once <lb/>
reinstated.</p>
<p>The Duke of Burgundy listened&#x2014;but waited. <lb/>
He could not doubt that the French King or the <lb/>
French people would come forward presently and <lb/>
pay a higher price than the English. He kept Joan <lb/>
a close prisoner in a strong fortress, and continued <lb/>
to wait, week after week. He was a French prince, <lb/>
<pb n="121"/>
and was at heart ashamed to sell her to the English. <lb/>
Yet with all his waiting no offer came to him from <lb/>
the French side.</p>
<p>One day Joan played a cunning trick on her jailer, <lb/>
and not only slipped out of her prison, but locked <lb/>
him up in it. But as she fled away she was seen by <lb/>
a sentinel, and was caught and brought back.</p>
<p>Then she was sent to Beaurevoir, a stronger castle. <lb/>
This was early in August, and she had been in cap- <lb/>
tivity more than two months now. Here she was <lb/>
shut up in the top of a tower which was sixty feet <lb/>
high. She ate her heart there for another long <lb/>
stretch&#x2014;about three months and a half. And she <lb/>
was aware, all these weary five months of captivity, <lb/>
that the English, under cover of the Church, were <lb/>
dickering for her as one would dicker for a horse or <lb/>
a slave, and that France was silent, the King silent, <lb/>
all her friends the same. Yes, it was pitiful.</p>
<p>And yet when she heard at last that Compi&#x00E8;gne <lb/>
was being closely besieged and likely to be cap- <lb/>
tured, and that the enemy had declared that no <lb/>
inhabitant of it should escape massacre, not even <lb/>
children of seven years of age, she was in a fever at <lb/>
once to fly to our rescue. So she tore her bed <lb/>
clothes to strips and tied them together and de- <lb/>
scended this frail rope in the night, and it broke, and <lb/>
she fell and was badly bruised, and remained three <lb/>
days insensible, meantime neither eating nor drink- <lb/>
ing.</p>
<p>And now came relief to us, led by the Count of <lb/>
<pb n="122"/>
Vend&#x00F4;me, and Compi&#x00E8;gne was saved and the siege <lb/>
raised. This was a disaster to the Duke of Bur- <lb/>
gundy. He had to have money now. It was a <lb/>
good time for a new bid to be made for Joan of <lb/>
Arc. The English at once sent a French Bishop&#x2014; <lb/>
that forever infamous Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais. <lb/>
He was partly promised the Archbishopric of <lb/>
Rouen, which was vacant, if he should succeed. <lb/>
He claimed the right to preside over Joan's ecclesi- <lb/>
astical trial because the battle-ground where she was <lb/>
taken was within his diocese.</p>
<p>By the military usage of the time the ransom of a <lb/>
royal prince was 10,000 livres of gold, which is <lb/>
61,125 francs&#x2014;a fixed sum, you see. It must be <lb/>
accepted when offered; it could not be refused.</p>
<p>Cauchon brought the offer of this very sum from <lb/>
the English&#x2014;a royal prince's ransom for the poor <lb/>
little peasant girl of Domremy. It shows in a <lb/>
striking way the English idea of her formidable im- <lb/>
portance. It was accepted. For that sum Joan of <lb/>
Arc, the Saviour of France, was sold; sold to her <lb/>
enemies; to the enemies of her country; enemies <lb/>
who had lashed and thrashed and thumped and <lb/>
trounced France for a century and made holiday <lb/>
sport of it; enemies who had forgotten, years and <lb/>
years ago, what a Frenchman's face was like, so <lb/>
used were they to seeing nothing but his back; <lb/>
enemies whom she had whipped, whom she had <lb/>
cowed, whom she had taught to respect French <lb/>
valor, new-born in her nation by the breath of her <lb/>
<pb n="123"/>
spirit; enemies who hungered for her life as being <lb/>
the only puissance able to stand between English <lb/>
triumph and French degradation. Sold to a French <lb/>
priest by a French prince, with the French King <lb/>
and the French nation standing thankless by and <lb/>
saying nothing.</p>
<p>And she&#x2014;what did she say? Nothing. Not a <lb/>
reproach passed her lips. She was too great for <lb/>
that&#x2014;she was Joan of Arc; and when that is said, <lb/>
all is said.</p>
<p>As a soldier, her record was spotless. She could <lb/>
not be called to account for anything under that <lb/>
head. A subterfuge must be found, and, as we <lb/>
have seen, was found. She must be tried by priests <lb/>
for crimes against religion. If none could be dis- <lb/>
covered, some must be invented. Let the miscreant <lb/>
Cauchon alone to contrive those.</p>
<p>Rouen was chosen as the scene of the trial. It <lb/>
was in the heart of the English power; its popula- <lb/>
tion had been under English dominion so many <lb/>
generations that they were hardly French now, save <lb/>
in language. The place was strongly garrisoned. <lb/>
Joan was taken there near the end of December, <lb/>
1430, and flung into a dungeon. Yes, and clothed <lb/>
in chains, that free spirit!</p>
<p>Still France made no move. How do I account <lb/>
for this? I think there is only one way. You will <lb/>
remember that whenever Joan was not at the front, <lb/>
the French held back and ventured nothing; that <lb/>
whenever she led, they swept everything before <lb/>
<pb n="124"/>
them, so long as they could see her white armor or <lb/>
her banner; that every time she fell wounded or was <lb/>
reported killed&#x2014;as at Compi&#x00E8;gne&#x2014;they broke in <lb/>
panic and fled like sheep. I argue from this that <lb/>
they had undergone no real transformation as yet; <lb/>
that at bottom they were still under the spell of a <lb/>
timorousness born of generations of unsuccess, and <lb/>
a lack of confidence in each other and in their lead- <lb/>
ers born of old and bitter experience in the way of <lb/>
treacheries of all sorts&#x2014;for their kings had been <lb/>
treacherous to their great vassals and to their gener- <lb/>
als, and these in turn were treacherous to the head <lb/>
of the state and to each other. The soldiery found <lb/>
that they could depend utterly on Joan, and upon <lb/>
her alone. With her gone, everything was gone. <lb/>
She was the sun that melted the frozen torrents and <lb/>
set them boiling; with that sun removed, they froze <lb/>
again, and the army and all France became what <lb/>
they had been before, mere dead corpses&#x2014;that and <lb/>
nothing more; incapable of thought, hope, ambi- <lb/>
tion, or motion.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>My</smcap> wound gave me a great deal of trouble clear <lb/>
into the first part of October; then the fresher <lb/>
weather renewed my life and strength. All this <lb/>
time there were reports drifting about that the King <lb/>
was going to ransom Joan. I believed these, for I <lb/>
was young and had not yet found out the littleness <lb/>
and meanness of our poor human race, which brags <lb/>
about itself so much, and thinks it is better and <lb/>
higher than the other animals.</p>
<p>In October I was well enough to go out with two <lb/>
sorties, and in the second one, on the 23d, I was <lb/>
wounded again. My luck had turned, you see. On <lb/>
the night of the 25th the besiegers decamped, and <lb/>
in the disorder and confusion one of their prisoners <lb/>
escaped and got safe into Compi&#x00E8;gne, and hobbled <lb/>
into my room as pallid and pathetic an object as <lb/>
you would wish to see.</p>
<p>"What? Alive? No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson!"</p>
<p>It was indeed he. It was a most joyful meeting, <lb/>
that you will easily know; and also as sad as it was <lb/>
joyful. We could not speak Joan's name. One's <lb/>
voice would have broken down. We knew who was <lb/>
<pb n="126"/>
meant when she was mentioned; we could say <lb/>
"she" and "her," but we could not speak the <lb/>
name.</p>
<p>We talked of the personal staff. Old D'Aulon, <lb/>
wounded and a prisoner, was still with Joan and <lb/>
serving her, by permission of the Duke of Burgundy. <lb/>
Joan was being treated with the respect due to her <lb/>
rank and to her character as a prisoner of war taken <lb/>
in honorable conflict. And this was continued&#x2014;as <lb/>
we learned later&#x2014;until she fell into the hands of <lb/>
that bastard of Satan, Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of <lb/>
Beauvais.</p>
<p>No&#x00EB;l was full of noble and affectionate praises and <lb/>
appreciations of our old boastful big Standard- <lb/>
Bearer, now gone silent forever, his real and imag- <lb/>
inary battles all fought, his work done, his life <lb/>
honorably closed and completed.</p>
<p>"And think of his luck!" burst out No&#x00EB;l, with <lb/>
his eyes full of tears. "Always the pet child of <lb/>
luck! See how it followed him and stayed by him, <lb/>
from his first step all through, in the field or out of <lb/>
it; always a splendid figure in the public eye, <lb/>
courted and envied everywhere; always having a <lb/>
chance to do fine things and always doing them; in <lb/>
the beginning called the Paladin in joke, and called <lb/>
it afterward in earnest because he magnificently <lb/>
made the title good; and at last&#x2014;supremest luck <lb/>
of all&#x2014;died in the field! died with his harness on; <lb/>
died faithful to his charge, the Standard in his hand; <lb/>
died&#x2014;oh, think of it&#x2014;with the approving eye of <lb/>
<pb n="127"/>
Joan of Arc upon him! He drained the cup of <lb/>
glory to the last drop, and went jubilant to his <lb/>
peace, blessedly spared all part in the disaster which <lb/>
was to follow. What luck, what luck! And we? <lb/>
What was our sin that we are still here, we who <lb/>
have also earned our place with the happy dead?"</p>
<p>And presently he said:</p>
<p>"They tore the sacred Standard from his dead <lb/>
hand and carried it away, their most precious prize <lb/>
after its captured owner. But they haven't it now. <lb/>
A month ago we put our lives upon the risk&#x2014;our <lb/>
two good knights, my fellow-prisoners, and I&#x2014;and <lb/>
stole it, and got it smuggled by trusty hands to <lb/>
Orleans, and there it is now, safe for all time in the <lb/>
Treasury."</p>
<p>I was glad and grateful to learn that. I have <lb/>
seen it often since, when I have gone to Orleans on <lb/>
the 8th of May to be the petted old guest of the <lb/>
city and hold the first place of honor at the ban- <lb/>
quets and in the processions&#x2014;I mean since Joan's <lb/>
brothers passed from this life. It will still be there, <lb/>
sacredly guarded by French love, a thousand years <lb/>
from now&#x2014;yes, as long as any shred of it hangs <lb/>
together.<ref target="n3">*</ref><note id="n3" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>It remained there three hundred and sixty years, and then was de- <lb/>
stroyed in a public bonfire, together with two swords, a plumed cap, <lb/>
several suits of state apparel, and other relics of the Maid, by a mob in <lb/>
the time of the Revolution. Nothing which the hand of Joan of Arc is <lb/>
known to have touched now remains in existence except a few preciously <lb/>
guarded military and state papers which she signed, her pen being <lb/>
guided by a clerk or her secretary Louis de Conte. A bowlder exists <lb/>
from which she is known to have mounted her horse when she was <lb/>
once setting out upon a campaign. Up to a quarter of a century ago <lb/>
there was a single hair from her head still in existence. It was drawn <lb/>
through the wax of a seal attached to the parchment of a state docu- <lb/>
ment. It was surreptitiously snipped out, seal and all, by some vandal <lb/>
relic-hunter, and carried off. Doubtless it still exists, but only the <lb/>
thief knows where.&#x2014;<smcap>Translator.</smcap></p></note></p>
<pb n="128"/>
<p>Two or three weeks after this talk came the tre- <lb/>
mendous news like a thunder-clap, and we were <lb/>
aghast&#x2014;Joan of Arc sold to the English!</p>
<p>Not for a moment had we ever dreamed of such a <lb/>
thing. We were young, you see, and did not know <lb/>
the human race, as I have said before. We had <lb/>
been so proud of our country, so sure of her noble- <lb/>
ness, her magnanimity, her gratitude. We had ex- <lb/>
pected little of the King, but of France we had <lb/>
expected everything. Everybody knew that in <lb/>
various towns patriot priests had been marching in <lb/>
procession urging the people to sacrifice money, <lb/>
property, everything, and buy the freedom of their <lb/>
heaven-sent deliverer. That the money would be <lb/>
raised we had not thought of doubting.</p>
<p>But it was all over now, all over. It was a bitter <lb/>
time for us. The heavens seemed hung with black; <lb/>
all cheer went out from our hearts. Was this com- <lb/>
rade here at my bedside really No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson, <lb/>
that light-hearted creature whose whole life was but <lb/>
one long joke, and who used up more breath in <lb/>
laughter than in keeping his body alive? No, no; <lb/>
<i>that</i> No&#x00EB;l I was to see no more. This one's heart <lb/>
was broken. He moved grieving about, and ab- <lb/>
<pb n="129"/>
sently, like one in a dream; the stream of his <lb/>
laughter was dried at its source.</p>
<p>Well, that was best. It was my own mood. We <lb/>
were company for each other. He nursed me <lb/>
patiently through the dull long weeks, and at last, <lb/>
in January, I was strong enough to go about again. <lb/>
Then he said:</p>
<p>"Shall we go now?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>There was no need to explain. Our hearts were <lb/>
in Rouen; we would carry our bodies there. All <lb/>
that we cared for in this life was shut up in that <lb/>
fortress. We could not help her, but it would be <lb/>
some solace to us to be near her, to breathe the air <lb/>
that she breathed, and look daily upon the stone <lb/>
walls that hid her. What if we should be made <lb/>
prisoners there? Well, we could but do our best, <lb/>
and let luck and fate decide what should happen.</p>
<p>And so we started. We could not realize the <lb/>
change which had come upon the country. We <lb/>
seemed able to choose our own route and go <lb/>
wherever we pleased, unchallenged and unmolested. <lb/>
When Joan of Arc was in the field, there was a sort <lb/>
of panic of fear everywhere; but now that she was <lb/>
out of the way, fear had vanished. Nobody was <lb/>
troubled about you or afraid of you, nobody was <lb/>
curious about you or your business, everybody was <lb/>
indifferent.</p>
<p>We presently saw that we could take to the Seine, <lb/>
and not weary ourselves out with land travel. So <lb/>
<pb n="130"/>
we did it, and were carried in a boat to within a <lb/>
league of Rouen. Then we got ashore; not on the <lb/>
hilly side, but on the other, where it is as level as a <lb/>
floor. Nobody could enter or leave the city with- <lb/>
out explaining himself. It was because they feared <lb/>
attempts at a rescue of Joan.</p>
<p>We had no trouble. We stopped in the plain <lb/>
with a family of peasants and stayed a week, help- <lb/>
ing them with their work for board and lodging, and <lb/>
making friends of them. We got clothes like theirs, <lb/>
and wore them. When we had worked our way <lb/>
through their reserves and gotten their confidence, <lb/>
we found that they secretly harbored French hearts <lb/>
in their bodies. Then we came out frankly and told <lb/>
them everything, and found them ready to do any- <lb/>
thing they could to help us. Our plan was soon <lb/>
made, and was quite simple. It was to help them <lb/>
drive a flock of sheep to the market of the city. <lb/>
One morning early we made the venture in a melan- <lb/>
choly drizzle of rain, and passed through the frown- <lb/>
ing gates unmolested. Our friends had friends living <lb/>
over a humble wine-shop in a quaint tall building <lb/>
situated in one of the narrow lanes that run down <lb/>
from the cathedral to the river, and with these they <lb/>
bestowed us; and the next day they smuggled our <lb/>
own proper clothing and other belongings to us. <lb/>
The family that lodged us&#x2014;the Pierrons&#x2014;were <lb/>
French in sympathy, and we needed to have no <lb/>
secrets from them.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER III.</b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was necessary for me to have some way to gain <lb/>
bread for No&#x00EB;l and myself; and when the Pier- <lb/>
rons found that I knew how to write, they applied <lb/>
to their confessor in my behalf, and he got a place <lb/>
for me with a good priest named Manchon, who <lb/>
was to be the chief recorder in the Great Trial of <lb/>
Joan of Arc now approaching. It was a strange <lb/>
position for me&#x2014;clerk to the recorder&#x2014;and <lb/>
dangerous if my sympathies and late employment <lb/>
should be found out. But there was not much <lb/>
danger. Manchon was at bottom friendly to Joan <lb/>
and would not betray me; and my name would not, <lb/>
for I had discarded my surname and retained only <lb/>
my given one, like a person of low degree.</p>
<p>I attended Manchon constantly straight along, out <lb/>
of January and into February, and was often in the <lb/>
citadel with him&#x2014;in the very fortress where Joan <lb/>
was imprisoned, though not in the dungeon where <lb/>
she was confined, and so did not see her, of course.</p>
<p>Manchon told me everything that had been hap- <lb/>
pening before my coming. Ever since the pur- <lb/>
chase of Joan, Cauchon had been busy packing his <lb/>
<pb n="132"/>
jury for the destruction of the Maid&#x2014;weeks and <lb/>
weeks he had spent in this bad industry. The <lb/>
University of Paris had sent him a number of learned <lb/>
and able and trusty ecclesiastics of the stripe he <lb/>
wanted; and he had scraped together a clergyman <lb/>
of like stripe and great fame here and there and <lb/>
yonder, until he was able to construct a formidable <lb/>
court numbering half a hundred distinguished names. <lb/>
French names they were, but their interests and <lb/>
sympathies were English.</p>
<p>A great officer of the Inquisition was also sent <lb/>
from Paris, for the accused must be tried by the <lb/>
forms of the Inquisition; but this was a brave and <lb/>
righteous man, and he said squarely that this court <lb/>
had no power to try the case, wherefore he refused <lb/>
to act; and the same honest talk was uttered by <lb/>
two or three others.</p>
<p>The Inquisitor was right. The case as here resur- <lb/>
rected against Joan had already been tried long ago <lb/>
at Poitiers, and decided in her favor. Yes, and by <lb/>
a higher tribunal than this one, for at the head of it <lb/>
was an Archbishop&#x2014;he of Rheims&#x2014;Cauchon's <lb/>
own metropolitan. So here, you see, a lower court <lb/>
was impudently preparing to re-try and re-decide a <lb/>
cause which had already been decided by its superior, <lb/>
a court of higher authority. Imagine it! No, the <lb/>
case could not properly be tried again. Cauchon <lb/>
could not properly preside in this new court, for <lb/>
more than one reason: Rouen was not in his dio- <lb/>
cese; Joan had not been arrested in her domicile, <lb/>
<pb n="133"/>
which was still Domremy; and finally this proposed <lb/>
judge was the prisoner's outspoken enemy, and <lb/>
therefore he was incompetent to try her. Yet all <lb/>
these large difficulties were gotten rid of. The terri- <lb/>
torial Chapter of Rouen finally granted territorial <lb/>
letters to Cauchon&#x2014;though only after a struggle <lb/>
and under compulsion. Force was also applied to <lb/>
the Inquisitor, and he was obliged to submit.</p>
<p>So, then, the little English King, by his repre- <lb/>
sentative, formally delivered Joan into the hands of <lb/>
the court, but with this reservation: <i>if the court <lb/>
failed to condemn her, he was to have her back <lb/>
again!</i></p>
<p>Ah, dear, what chance was there for that forsaken <lb/>
and friendless child? Friendless, indeed&#x2014;it is the <lb/>
right word. For she was in a black dungeon, with <lb/>
half a dozen brutal common soldiers keeping guard <lb/>
night and day in the room where her cage was&#x2014; <lb/>
for she was in a cage; an iron cage, and chained to <lb/>
her bed by neck and hands and feet. Never a per- <lb/>
son near her whom she had ever seen before; never <lb/>
a woman at all. Yes, this was, indeed, friendless- <lb/>
ness.</p>
<p>Now it was a vassal of Jean de Luxembourg who <lb/>
captured Joan at Compi&#x00E8;gne, and it was Jean who <lb/>
sold her to the Duke of Burgundy. Yet this very <lb/>
De Luxembourg was shameless enough to go and <lb/>
show his face to Joan in her cage. He came with <lb/>
two English earls, Warwick and Stafford. He was <lb/>
a poor reptile. He told her he would get her set <lb/>
<pb n="134"/>
free if she would promise not to fight the English <lb/>
any more. She had been in that cage a long time <lb/>
now, but not long enough to break her spirit. She <lb/>
retorted scornfully:</p>
<p>"Name of God, you but mock me. I know that <lb/>
you have neither the power nor the will to do it."</p>
<p>He insisted. Then the pride and dignity of the <lb/>
soldier rose in Joan, and she lifted her chained <lb/>
hands and let them fall with a clash, saying:</p>
<p>"See these! They know more than you, and <lb/>
can prophesy better. I know that the English are <lb/>
going to kill me, for they think that when I am dead <lb/>
they can get the Kingdom of France. It is not so. <lb/>
Though there were a hundred thousand of them <lb/>
they would never get it."</p>
<p>This defiance infuriated Stafford, and he&#x2014;now <lb/>
think of it&#x2014;he a free, strong man, she a chained <lb/>
and helpless girl&#x2014;he drew his dagger and flung <lb/>
himself at her to stab her. But Warwick seized him <lb/>
and held him back. Warwick was wise. Take her <lb/>
life in that way? Send her to Heaven stainless and <lb/>
undisgraced? It would make her the idol of France, <lb/>
and the whole nation would rise and march to vic- <lb/>
tory and emancipation under the inspiration of her <lb/>
spirit. No, she must be saved for another fate than <lb/>
that.</p>
<p>Well, the time was approaching for the Great <lb/>
Trial. For more than two months Cauchon had <lb/>
been raking and scraping everywhere for any odds <lb/>
and ends of evidence or suspicion or conjecture that <lb/>
<pb n="135"/>
might be made usable against Joan, and carefully <lb/>
suppressing all evidence that came to hand in her <lb/>
favor. He had limitless ways and means and powers <lb/>
at his disposal for preparing and strengthening the <lb/>
case for the prosecution, and he used them all.</p>
<p>But Joan had no one to prepare her case for her, <lb/>
and she was shut up in those stone walls and had no <lb/>
friend to appeal to for help. And as for witnesses, <lb/>
she could not call a single one in her defense; they <lb/>
were all far away, under the French flag, and this <lb/>
was an English court; they would have been seized <lb/>
and hanged if they had shown their faces at the <lb/>
gates of Rouen. No, the prisoner must be the <i>sole</i> <lb/>
witness&#x2014;witness for the prosecution, witness for <lb/>
the defense; and with a verdict of death resolved <lb/>
upon before the doors were opened for the court's <lb/>
first sitting.</p>
<p>When she learned that the court was made up of <lb/>
ecclesiastics in the interest of the English, she <lb/>
begged that in fairness an equal number of priests <lb/>
of the French party should be added to these. <lb/>
Cauchon scoffed at her message, and would not <lb/>
even deign to answer it.</p>
<p>By the law of the Church&#x2014;she being a minor <lb/>
under twenty-one&#x2014;it was her right to have counsel <lb/>
to conduct her case, advise her how to answer when <lb/>
questioned, and protect her from falling into traps <lb/>
set by cunning devices of the prosecution. She <lb/>
probably did not know that this was her right, and <lb/>
that she could demand it and require it, for there <lb/>
<pb n="136"/>
was none to tell her that; but she begged for this <lb/>
help at any rate. Cauchon refused it. She urged <lb/>
and implored, pleading her youth and her ignorance <lb/>
of the complexities and intricacies of the law and of <lb/>
legal procedure. Cauchon refused again, and said <lb/>
she must get along with her case as best she might <lb/>
by herself. Ah, his heart was a stone.</p>
<p>Cauchon prepared the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal.</i></foreign> I will sim- <lb/>
plify that by calling it the Bill of Particulars. It was <lb/>
a detailed list of the charges against her, and formed <lb/>
the basis of the trial. Charges? It was a list of <lb/>
<i>suspicions and public rumors</i>&#x2014;those were the words <lb/>
used. It was merely charged that she was suspected <lb/>
of having been guilty of heresies, witchcraft, and <lb/>
other such offenses against religion.</p>
<p>Now by law of the Church, a trial of that sort <lb/>
could not be begun until a searching inquiry had <lb/>
been made into the history and character of the <lb/>
accused, and it was essential that the result of this <lb/>
inquiry be added to the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal</i></foreign> and form a <lb/>
part of it. You remember that that was the first <lb/>
thing they did before the trial at Poitiers. They did <lb/>
it again now. An ecclesiastic was sent to Dom- <lb/>
remy. There and all about the neighborhood he <lb/>
made an exhaustive search into Joan's history and <lb/>
character, and came back with his verdict. It was <lb/>
very clear. The searcher reported that he found <lb/>
Joan's character to be in every way what he "would <lb/>
like his own sister's character to be." Just about <lb/>
the same report that was brought back to Poitiers, <lb/>
<pb n="137"/>
you see. Joan's was a character which could en- <lb/>
dure the minutest examination.</p>
<p>This verdict was a strong point for Joan, you will <lb/>
say. Yes, it <i>would</i> have been if it could have seen <lb/>
the light; but Cauchon was awake, and it disap- <lb/>
peared from the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal</i></foreign> before the trial. <lb/>
People were prudent enough not to inquire what <lb/>
became of it.</p>
<p>One would imagine that Cauchon was ready to <lb/>
begin the trial by this time. But no, he devised one <lb/>
more scheme for poor Joan's destruction, and it <lb/>
promised to be a deadly one.</p>
<p>One of the great personages picked out and sent <lb/>
down by the University of Paris was an ecclesiastic <lb/>
named Nicolas Loyseleur. He was tall, handsome, <lb/>
grave, of smooth soft speech and courteous and <lb/>
winning manners. There was no seeming of treach- <lb/>
cry or hypocrisy about him, yet he was full of both. <lb/>
He was admitted to Joan's prison by night, disguised <lb/>
as a cobbler; he pretended to be from her own <lb/>
country; he professed to be secretly a patriot; he <lb/>
revealed the fact that he was a priest. She was <lb/>
filled with gladness to see one from the hills and <lb/>
plains that were so dear to her; happier still to look <lb/>
upon a priest and disburden her heart in confession, <lb/>
for the offices of the Church were the bread of life, <lb/>
the breath of her nostrils to her, and she had been <lb/>
long forced to pine for them in vain. She opened <lb/>
her whole innocent heart to this creature, and in re- <lb/>
turn he gave her advice concerning her trial which <lb/>
<pb n="138"/>
could have destroyed her if her deep native wisdom <lb/>
had not protected her against following it.</p>
<p>You will ask, what value could this scheme have, <lb/>
since the secrets of the confessional are sacred and <lb/>
cannot be revealed? True&#x2014;but suppose another <lb/>
person should overhear them? That person is not <lb/>
bound to keep the secret. Well, that is what <lb/>
happened. Cauchon had previously caused a hole <lb/>
to be bored through the wall; and he stood with <lb/>
his ear to that hole and heard all. It is pitiful <lb/>
to think of these things. One wonders how they <lb/>
could treat that poor child so. She had not <lb/>
done them any harm.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IV">
<pb n="139"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER IV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>On</smcap> Tuesday, the 20th of February, while I sat <lb/>
at my master's work in the evening, he came <lb/>
in, looking sad, and said it had been decided to <lb/>
begin the trial at eight o'clock the next morning, <lb/>
and I must get ready to assist him.</p>
<p>Of course I had been expecting such news every <lb/>
day for many days; but no matter, the shock of it <lb/>
almost took my breath away and set me trembling <lb/>
like a leaf. I suppose that without knowing it I had <lb/>
been half imagining that at the last moment some- <lb/>
thing would happen, something that would stop this <lb/>
fatal trial: maybe that La Hire would burst in at <lb/>
the gates with his hellions at his back; maybe that <lb/>
God would have pity and stretch forth His mighty <lb/>
hand. But now&#x2014;now there was no hope.</p>
<p>The trial was to begin in the chapel of the fortress <lb/>
and would be public. So I went sorrowing away <lb/>
and told No&#x00EB;l, so that he might be there early and <lb/>
secure a place. It would give him a chance to look <lb/>
again upon the face which we so revered and which <lb/>
was so precious to us. All the way, both going and <lb/>
coming, I plowed through chattering and rejoicing <lb/>
<pb n="140"/>
multitudes of English soldiery and English-hearted <lb/>
French citizens. There was no talk but of the <lb/>
coming event. Many times I heard the remark, <lb/>
accompanied by a pitiless laugh:</p>
<p>"The fat Bishop has got things as he wants them <lb/>
at last, and says he will lead the vile witch a merry <lb/>
dance and a short one."</p>
<p>But here and there I glimpsed compassion and <lb/>
distress in a face, and it was not always a French <lb/>
one. English soldiers feared Joan, but they admired <lb/>
her for her great deeds and her unconquerable <lb/>
spirit.</p>
<p>In the morning Manchon and I went early, yet as <lb/>
we approached the vast fortress we found crowds of <lb/>
men already there and still others gathering. The <lb/>
chapel was already full and the way barred against <lb/>
further admissions of unofficial persons. We took <lb/>
our appointed places. Throned on high sat the <lb/>
president, Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, in his <lb/>
grand robes, and before him in rows sat his robed <lb/>
court&#x2014;fifty distinguished ecclesiastics, men of high <lb/>
degree in the Church, of clear-cut intellectual faces, <lb/>
men of deep learning, veteran adepts in strategy and <lb/>
casuistry, practiced setters of traps for ignorant <lb/>
minds and unwary feet. When I looked around <lb/>
upon this army of masters of legal fence, gathered <lb/>
here to find just one verdict and no other, and re- <lb/>
membered that Joan must fight for her good name <lb/>
and her life single-handed against them, I asked <lb/>
myself what chance an ignorant poor country girl <lb/>
<pb n="141"/>
of nineteen could have in such an unequal conflict; <lb/>
and my heart sank down low, very low. When I <lb/>
looked again at that obese president, puffing and <lb/>
wheezing there, his great belly distending and re- <lb/>
ceding with each breath, and noted his three chins, <lb/>
fold above fold, and his knobby and knotty face, <lb/>
and his purple and splotchy complexion, and his <lb/>
repulsive cauliflower nose, and his cold and malig- <lb/>
nant eyes&#x2014;a brute, every detail of him&#x2014;my heart <lb/>
sank lower still. And when I noted that all were <lb/>
afraid of this man, and shrank and fidgeted in their <lb/>
seats when his eye smote theirs, my last poor ray of <lb/>
hope dissolved away and wholly disappeared.</p>
<p>There was one unoccupied seat in this place, and <lb/>
only one. It was over against the wall, in view of <lb/>
every one. It was a little wooden bench without a <lb/>
back, and it stood apart and solitary on a sort of <lb/>
dais. Tall men-at-arms in morion, breastplate, <lb/>
and steel gauntlets stood as stiff as their own hal- <lb/>
berds on each side of this dais, but no other creature <lb/>
was near by it. A pathetic little bench to me it was, <lb/>
for I knew whom it was for; and the sight of it <lb/>
carried my mind back to the great court at Poitiers, <lb/>
where Joan sat upon one like it and calmly fought <lb/>
her cunning fight with the astonished doctors of the <lb/>
Church and Parliament, and rose from it victorious <lb/>
and applauded by all, and went forth to fill the <lb/>
world with the glory of her name.</p>
<p>What a dainty little figure she was, and how gentle <lb/>
and innocent, how winning and beautiful in the fresh <lb/>
<pb n="142"/>
bloom of her seventeen years! Those were grand <lb/>
days. And so recent&#x2014;for she was but just nine- <lb/>
teen now&#x2014;and how much she had seen since, and <lb/>
what wonders she had accomplished!</p>
<p>But now&#x2014;oh, all was changed now. She had <lb/>
been languishing in dungeons, away from light and <lb/>
air and the cheer of friendly faces, for nearly three- <lb/>
quarters of a year&#x2014;she, born child of the sun, <lb/>
natural comrade of the birds and of all happy free <lb/>
creatures. She would be weary now, and worn with <lb/>
this long captivity, her forces impaired; despondent, <lb/>
perhaps, as knowing there was no hope. Yes, all <lb/>
was changed.</p>
<p>All this time there had been a muffled hum of <lb/>
conversation, and rustling of robes and scraping of <lb/>
feet on the floor, a combination of dull noises which <lb/>
filled all the place. Suddenly:</p>
<p>"Produce the accused!"</p>
<p>It made me catch my breath. My heart began to <lb/>
thump like a hammer. But there was silence now&#x2014; <lb/>
silence absolute. All those noises ceased, and it <lb/>
was as if they had never been. Not a sound; the <lb/>
stillness grew oppressive; it was like a weight upon <lb/>
one. All faces were turned toward the door; and <lb/>
one could properly expect that, for most of the <lb/>
people there suddenly realized, no doubt, that they <lb/>
were about to see, in actual flesh and blood, what <lb/>
had been to them before only an embodied prodigy, <lb/>
a word, a phrase, a world-girdling Name.</p>
<p>The stillness continued. Then, far down the <lb/>
<pb n="143"/>
stone-paved corridors, one heard a vague slow sound <lb/>
approaching: <i>clank</i>&#x2026;&#x2026;clink&#x2026;&#x2026;clank&#x2014;Joan <lb/>
of Arc, Deliverer of France, in chains!</p>
<p>My head swam; all things whirled and spun about <lb/>
me. Ah, <i>I</i> was realizing, too.</p>

<p>To take up my story now where I left off. We <lb/>
heard the clanking of Joan's chains down the corri- <lb/>
dors; she was approaching.</p>
<p>Presently she appeared; a thrill swept the house, <lb/>
and one heard deep breaths drawn. Two guardsmen <lb/>
followed her at a short distance to the rear. Her <lb/>
<pb n="145"/>
head was bowed a little, and she moved slowly, she <lb/>
being weak and her irons heavy. She had on men's <lb/>
attire&#x2014;all black; a soft woolen stuff, intensely <lb/>
black, funereally black, not a speck of relieving color <lb/>
in it from her throat to the floor. A wide collar of <lb/>
this same black stuff lay in radiating folds upon her <lb/>
shoulders and breast; the sleeves of her doublet were <lb/>
full, down to the elbows, and tight thence to her <lb/>
manacled wrists; below the doublet, tight black <lb/>
hose down to the chains on her ankles.</p>
<p>Half way to her bench she stopped, just where a <lb/>
wide shaft of light fell slanting from a window, and <lb/>
slowly lifted her face. Another thrill!&#x2014;it was <lb/>
totally colorless, white as snow; a face of gleaming <lb/>
snow set in vivid contrast upon that slender statue <lb/>
of somber unmitigated black. It was smooth and <lb/>
pure and girlish, beautiful beyond belief, infinitely <lb/>
sad and sweet. But, dear, dear! when the challenge <lb/>
of those untamed eyes fell upon that judge, and the <lb/>
droop vanished from her form and it straightened up <lb/>
soldierly and noble, my heart leaped for joy; and I <lb/>
said, all is well, all is well&#x2014;they have not broken <lb/>
her, they have not conquered her, she is Joan of <lb/>
Arc still! Yes, it was plain to me now that there <lb/>
was one spirit there which this dreaded judge could <lb/>
not quell nor make afraid.</p>
<p>She moved to her place and mounted the dais and <lb/>
seated herself upon her bench, gathering her chains <lb/>
into her lap and nestling her little white hands there. <lb/>
Then she waited in tranquil dignity, the only person <lb/>
<pb n="146"/>
there who seemed unmoved and unexcited. A <lb/>
bronzed and brawny English soldier, standing at <lb/>
martial ease in the front rank of the citizen spec- <lb/>
tators, did now most gallantly and respectfully put <lb/>
up his great hand and give her the military salute; <lb/>
and she, smiling friendly, put up hers and returned <lb/>
it; whereat there was a sympathetic little break of <lb/>
applause, which the judge sternly silenced.</p>
<p>Now the memorable inquisition called in history <lb/>
the Great Trial began. Fifty experts against a <lb/>
novice, and no one to help the novice!</p>
<p>The judge summarized the circumstances of the <lb/>
case and the public reports and suspicions upon <lb/>
which it was based; then he required Joan to kneel <lb/>
and make oath that she would answer with exact <lb/>
truthfulness to all questions asked her.</p>
<p>Joan's mind was not asleep. It suspected that <lb/>
dangerous possibilities might lie hidden under this <lb/>
apparently fair and reasonable demand. She an- <lb/>
swered with the simplicity which so often spoiled <lb/>
the enemy's best-laid plans in the trial at Poitiers, <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"No; for I do not know what you are going to <lb/>
ask me; you might ask of me things which I would <lb/>
not tell you."</p>
<p>This incensed the Court, and brought out a brisk <lb/>
flurry of angry exclamations. Joan was not dis- <lb/>
turbed. Cauchon raised his voice and began to <lb/>
speak in the midst of this noise, but he was so angry <lb/>
that he could hardly get his words out. He said.</p>
<pb n="147"/>
<p>"With the divine assistance of our Lord we re- <lb/>
quire you to expedite these proceedings for the <lb/>
welfare of your conscience. Swear, with your hands <lb/>
upon the Gospels, that you will answer true to the <lb/>
questions which shall be asked you!" and he <lb/>
brought down his fat hand with a crash upon his <lb/>
official table.</p>
<p>Joan said, with composure:</p>
<p>"As concerning my father and mother, and the <lb/>
faith, and what things I have done since my coming <lb/>
into France, I will gladly answer; but as regards the <lb/>
revelations which I have received from God, my <lb/>
Voices have forbidden me to confide them to any <lb/>
save my King&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Here there was another angry outburst of threats <lb/>
and expletives, and much movement and confusion; <lb/>
so she had to stop, and wait for the noise to sub- <lb/>
side; then her waxen face flushed a little and she <lb/>
straightened up and fixed her eye on the judge, and <lb/>
finished her sentence in a voice that had the old ring <lb/>
in it:</p>
<p>"&#x2014;and I will never reveal these things though <lb/>
you cut my head off!"</p>
<p>Well, maybe you know what a deliberative body of <lb/>
Frenchmen is like. The judge and half the court <lb/>
were on their feet in a moment, and all shaking their <lb/>
fists at the prisoner, and all storming and vituperating <lb/>
at once, so that you could hardly hear yourself <lb/>
think. They kept this up several minutes; and <lb/>
because Joan sat untroubled and indifferent, they <lb/>
<pb n="148"/>
grew madder and noisier all the time. Once she <lb/>
said, with a fleeting trace of the old-time mischief in <lb/>
her eye and manner:</p>
<p>"Prithee, speak one at a time, fair lords, then I <lb/>
will answer all of you."</p>
<p>At the end of three whole hours of furious de- <lb/>
bating over the oath, the situation had not changed <lb/>
a jot. The Bishop was still requiring an unmodified <lb/>
oath, Joan was refusing for the twentieth time to <lb/>
take any except the one which she had herself pro- <lb/>
posed. There was a physical change apparent, but <lb/>
it was confined to court and judge; they were <lb/>
hoarse, droopy, exhausted by their long frenzy, and <lb/>
had a sort of haggard look in their faces, poor men, <lb/>
whereas Joan was still placid and reposeful and did <lb/>
not seem noticeably tired.</p>
<p>The noise quieted down; there was a waiting <lb/>
pause of some moments' duration. Then the judge <lb/>
surrendered to the prisoner, and with bitterness in <lb/>
his voice told her to take the oath after her own <lb/>
fashion. Joan sunk at once to her knees; and as <lb/>
she laid her hands upon the Gospels, that big English <lb/>
soldier set free his mind:</p>
<p>"By God, if she were but English, she were not in <lb/>
this place another half a second!"</p>
<p>It was the soldier in him responding to the soldier <lb/>
in her. But what a stinging rebuke it was, what an <lb/>
arraignment of French character and French royalty! <lb/>
Would that he could have uttered just that one <lb/>
phrase in the hearing of Orleans! I know that that <lb/>

grateful city, that adoring city, would have risen, to <lb/>
the last man and the last woman, and marched upon <lb/>
Rouen. Some speeches&#x2014;speeches that shame a man <lb/>
and humble him&#x2014;burn themselves into the memory <lb/>
and remain there. That one is burned into mine.</p>
<p>After Joan had made oath, Cauchon asked her <lb/>
her name, and where she was born, and some ques- <lb/>
tions about her family; also what her age was. She <lb/>
answered these. Then he asked her how much edu- <lb/>
cation she had.</p>
<p>"I have learned from my mother the Pater <lb/>
Noster, the Ave Maria, and the Belief. All that I <lb/>
know was taught me by my mother."</p>
<p>Questions of this unessential sort dribbled on for <lb/>
a considerable time. Everybody was tired out by <lb/>
now, except Joan. The tribunal prepared to rise. <lb/>
At this point Cauchon forbade Joan to try to escape <lb/>
from prison, upon pain of being held guilty of the <lb/>
crime of heresy&#x2014;singular logic! She answered <lb/>
simply:</p>
<p>"I am not bound by this prohibition. If I could <lb/>
escape I would not reproach myself, for I have <lb/>
given no promise, and I shall not."</p>
<p>Then she complained of the burden of her chains, <lb/>
and asked that they might be removed, for she was <lb/>
strongly guarded in that dungeon and there was no <lb/>
need of them. But the Bishop refused, and re- <lb/>
minded her that she had broken out of prison twice <lb/>
before. Joan of Arc was too proud to insist. She <lb/>
only said, as she rose to go with the guard:</p>
<pb n="150"/>
<p>"It is true I have wanted to escape, and I do <lb/>
want to escape." Then she added, in a way that <lb/>
would touch the pity of anybody, I think, "It is <lb/>
the right of every prisoner."</p>
<p>And so she went from the place in the midst of <lb/>
an impressive stillness, which made the sharper and <lb/>
more distressful to me the clank of those pathetic <lb/>
chains.</p>
<p>What presence of mind she had! One could <lb/>
never surprise her out of it. She saw No&#x00EB;l and me <lb/>
there when she first took her seat on her bench, and <lb/>
we flushed to the forehead with excitement and <lb/>
emotion, but her face showed nothing, betrayed <lb/>
nothing. Her eyes sought us fifty times that day, <lb/>
but they passed on and there was never any ray of <lb/>
recognition in them. Another would have started <lb/>
upon seeing us, and then&#x2014;why then there could <lb/>
have been trouble for us, of course.</p>
<p>We walked slowly home together, each busy with <lb/>
his own grief and saying not a word.</p>

<pb n="151"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER VI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>That</smcap> night Manchon told me that all through <lb/>
the day's proceedings Cauchon had had some <lb/>
clerks concealed in the embrasure of a window who <lb/>
were to make a special report garbling Joan's <lb/>
answers and twisting them from their right meaning. <lb/>
Ah, that was surely the cruelest man and the most <lb/>
shameless that has lived in this world. But his <lb/>
scheme failed. Those clerks had human hearts in <lb/>
them, and their base work revolted them, and they <lb/>
turned to and boldly made a straight report, where- <lb/>
upon Cauchon cursed them and ordered them out of <lb/>
his presence with a threat of drowning, which was his <lb/>
favorite and most frequent menace. The matter <lb/>
had gotten abroad and was making great and un- <lb/>
pleasant talk, and Cauchon would not try to repeat <lb/>
this shabby game right away. It comforted me to <lb/>
hear that.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the citadel next morning, we <lb/>
found that a change had been made. The chapel <lb/>
had been found too small. The court had now re- <lb/>
moved to a noble chamber situated at the end of the <lb/>
great hall of the castle. The number of judges was <lb/>
<pb n="152"/>
increased to sixty-two&#x2014;one ignorant girl against <lb/>
such odds, and none to help her.</p>
<p>The prisoner was brought in. She was as white <lb/>
as ever, but she was looking no whit worse than she <lb/>
looked when she had first appeared the day before. <lb/>
Isn't it a strange thing? Yesterday she had sat five <lb/>
hours on that backless bench with her chains in her <lb/>
lap, baited, badgered, persecuted by that unholy <lb/>
crew, without even the refreshment of a cup of <lb/>
water&#x2014;for she was never offered anything, and if I <lb/>
have made you know her by this time you will know <lb/>
without my telling you that she was not a person <lb/>
likely to ask favors of those people. And she had <lb/>
spent the night caged in her wintry dungeon with <lb/>
her chains upon her; yet here she was, as I say, <lb/>
collected, unworn, and ready for the conflict; yes, <lb/>
and the only person there who showed no signs of <lb/>
the wear and worry of yesterday. And her eyes&#x2014; <lb/>
ah, you should have seen them and broken your <lb/>
hearts. Have you seen that veiled deep glow, that <lb/>
pathetic hurt dignity, that unsubdued and unsubdu- <lb/>
able spirit that burns and smoulders in the eye of a <lb/>
caged eagle and makes you feel mean and shabby <lb/>
under the burden of its mute reproach? Her eyes <lb/>
were like that. How capable they were, and how <lb/>
wonderful! Yes, at all times and in all circumstances <lb/>
they could express as by print every shade of the <lb/>
wide range of her moods. In them were hidden <lb/>
floods of gay sunshine, the softest and peacefulest <lb/>
twilights, and devastating storms and lightnings. <lb/>
<pb n="153"/>
Not in this world have there been others that were <lb/>
comparable to them. Such is my opinion, and <lb/>
none that had the privilege to see them would say <lb/>
otherwise than this which I have said concerning <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>The seance began. And how did it begin, should <lb/>
you think? Exactly as it began before&#x2014;with that <lb/>
same tedious thing which had been settled once, <lb/>
after so much wrangling. The Bishop opened <lb/>
thus:</p>
<p>"You are required, now, to take the oath pure <lb/>
and simple, to answer truly all questions asked you."</p>
<p>Joan replied placidly:</p>
<p>"I have made oath yesterday, my lord; let that <lb/>
suffice."</p>
<p>The Bishop insisted and insisted, with rising <lb/>
temper; Joan but shook her head and remained <lb/>
silent. At last she said:</p>
<p>"I made oath yesterday; it is sufficient." Then <lb/>
she sighed and said, "Of a truth, you do burden me <lb/>
too much."</p>
<p>The Bishop still insisted, still commanded, but he <lb/>
could not move her. At last he gave it up and <lb/>
turned her over for the day's inquest to an old hand <lb/>
at tricks and traps and deceptive plausibilities&#x2014; <lb/>
Beaupere, a doctor of theology. Now notice the <lb/>
form of this sleek strategist's first remark&#x2014;flung <lb/>
out in an easy, off-hand way that would have thrown <lb/>
any unwatchful person off his guard:</p>
<p>"Now, Joan, the matter is very simple; just <lb/>
<pb n="154"/>
speak up and frankly and truly answer the questions <lb/>
which I am going to ask you, as you have sworn to <lb/>
do."</p>
<p>It was a failure. Joan was not asleep. She saw <lb/>
the artifice. She said:</p>
<p>"No. You could ask me things which I could <lb/>
not tell you&#x2014;and would not." Then, reflecting <lb/>
upon how profane and out of character it was for <lb/>
these ministers of God to be prying into matters <lb/>
which had proceeded from His hands under the <lb/>
awful seal of His secrecy, she added, with a warning <lb/>
note in her tone, "If you were well informed con- <lb/>
cerning me you would wish me out of your hands. <lb/>
I have done nothing but by revelation."</p>
<p>Beaupere changed his attack, and began an ap- <lb/>
proach from another quarter. He would slip upon <lb/>
her, you see, under cover of innocent and unim- <lb/>
portant questions.</p>
<p>"Did you learn any trade at home?"</p>
<p>"Yes, to sew and to spin." Then the invincible <lb/>
soldier, victor of Patay, conqueror of the lion Tal- <lb/>
bot, deliverer of Orleans, restorer of a king's crown, <lb/>
commander-in-chief of a nation's armies, straight- <lb/>
ened herself proudly up, gave her head a little toss, <lb/>
and said with na&#x00EF;ve complacency, "And when it <lb/>
comes to that, I am not afraid to be matched against <lb/>
any woman in Rouen!"</p>
<p>The crowd of spectators broke out with applause <lb/>
&#x2014;which pleased Joan&#x2014;and there was many a <lb/>
friendly and petting smile to be seen. But Cauchon <lb/>
<pb n="155"/>
stormed at the people and warned them to keep still <lb/>
and mind their manners.</p>
<p>Beaupere asked other questions. Then:</p>
<p>"Had you other occupations at home?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I helped my mother in the household <lb/>
work and went to the pastures with the sheep and <lb/>
the cattle."</p>
<p>Her voice trembled a little, but one could hardly <lb/>
notice it. As for me, it brought those old enchanted <lb/>
days flooding back to me, and I could not see what <lb/>
I was writing for a little while.</p>
<p>Beaupere cautiously edged along up with other <lb/>
questions toward the forbidden ground, and finally <lb/>
repeated a question which she had refused to answer <lb/>
a little while back&#x2014;as to whether she had received <lb/>
the Eucharist in those days at other festivals than <lb/>
that of Easter. Joan merely said:</p>
<p>"<foreign lang="fre"><i>Passez outre</i></foreign>." Or, as one might say, "Pass <lb/>
on to matters which you are privileged to pry into."</p>
<p>I heard a member of the court say to a neighbor:</p>
<p>"As a rule, witnesses are but dull creatures, and <lb/>
an easy prey&#x2014;yes, and easily embarrassed, easily <lb/>
frightened&#x2014;but truly one can neither scare this <lb/>
child nor find her dozing."</p>
<p>Presently the house pricked up its ears and began <lb/>
to listen eagerly, for Beaupere began to touch upon <lb/>
Joan's Voices, a matter of consuming interest and <lb/>
curiosity to everybody. His purpose was, to trick <lb/>
her into heedless sayings that could indicate that the <lb/>
Voices had sometimes given her evil advice&#x2014;hence <lb/>
<pb n="156"/>
that they had come from Satan, you see. To have <lb/>
dealings with the devil&#x2014;well, that would send her <lb/>
to the stake in brief order, and that was the deliber- <lb/>
ate end and aim of this trial.</p>
<p>"When did you first hear these Voices?"</p>
<p>"I was thirteen when I first heard a Voice coming <lb/>
from God to help me to live well. I was frightened. <lb/>
It came at mid-day, in my father's garden in the <lb/>
summer."</p>
<p>"Had you been fasting?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The day before?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"From what direction did it come?"</p>
<p>"From the right&#x2014;from toward the church."</p>
<p>"Did it come with a bright light?"</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed yes. It was brilliant. When I <lb/>
came into France I often heard the Voices very <lb/>
loud."</p>
<p>"What did the Voice sound like?"</p>
<p>"It was a noble Voice, and I thought it was sent <lb/>
to me from God. The third time I heard it I recog- <lb/>
nized it as being an angel's."</p>
<p>"You could understand it?"</p>
<p>"Quite easily. It was always clear."</p>
<p>"What advice did it give you as to the salvation <lb/>
of your soul?"</p>
<p>"It told me to live rightly, and be regular in <lb/>
attendance upon the services of the Church. And <lb/>
it told me that I must go to France."</p>
<pb n="157"/>
<p>"In what species of form did the Voice appear?"</p>
<p>Joan looked suspiciously at the priest a moment, <lb/>
then said, tranquilly:</p>
<p>"As to that, I will not tell you."</p>
<p>"Did the Voice seek you often?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Twice or three times a week, saying, <lb/>
'Leave your village and go to France.'"</p>
<p>"Did your father know about your departure?"</p>
<p>"No. The Voice said, 'Go to France'; there- <lb/>
fore I could not abide at home any longer."</p>
<p>"What else did it say?"</p>
<p>"That I should raise the siege of Orleans."</p>
<p>"Was that all?"</p>
<p>"No, I was to go to Vaucouleurs, and Robert de <lb/>
Baudricourt would give me soldiers to go with me to <lb/>
France; and I answered, saying that I was a poor <lb/>
girl who did not know how to ride, neither how to <lb/>
fight."</p>
<p>Then she told how she was balked and inter- <lb/>
rupted at Vaucouleurs, but finally got her soldiers, <lb/>
and began her march.</p>
<p>"How were you dressed?"</p>
<p>The court of Poitiers had distinctly decided and <lb/>
decreed that as God had appointed her to do a <lb/>
man's work, it was meet and no scandal to religion <lb/>
that she should dress as a man; but no matter, this <lb/>
court was ready to use any and all weapons against <lb/>
Joan, even broken and discredited ones, and much <lb/>
was going to be made of this one before this trial <lb/>
should end.</p>
<pb n="158"/>
<p>"I wore a man's dress, also a sword which Robert <lb/>
de Baudricourt gave me, but no other weapon."</p>
<p>"Who was it that advised you to wear the dress <lb/>
of a man?"</p>
<p>Joan was suspicious again. She would not answer.</p>
<p>The question was repeated.</p>
<p>She refused again.</p>
<p>"Answer. It is a command!"</p>
<p>"<foreign lang="fre"><i>Passez outre</i></foreign>," was all she said.</p>
<p>So Beaupere gave up the matter for the present.</p>
<p>"What did Baudricourt say to you when you <lb/>
left?"</p>
<p>"He made them that were to go with me promise <lb/>
to take charge of me, and to me he said, 'Go, and <lb/>
let happen what may!'" (<foreign lang="fre"><i>Advienne que pourra!</i></foreign>)</p>
<p>After a good deal of questioning upon other <lb/>
matters she was asked again about her attire. She <lb/>
said it was necessary for her to dress as a man.</p>
<p>"Did your Voice advise it?"</p>
<p>Joan merely answered placidly:</p>
<p>"I believe my Voice gave me good advice."</p>
<p>It was all that could be got out of her, so the <lb/>
questions wandered to other matters, and finally to <lb/>
her first meeting with the King at Chinon. She said <lb/>
she chose out the King, who was unknown to her, <lb/>
by the revelation of her Voices. All that happened <lb/>
at that time was gone over. Finally:</p>
<p>"Do you still hear those Voices?"</p>
<p>"They come to me every day."</p>
<p>"What do you ask of them?"</p>
<pb n="159"/>
<p>"I have never asked of them any recompense but <lb/>
the salvation of my soul."</p>
<p>"Did the Voice always urge you to follow the <lb/>
army?"</p>
<p>He is creeping upon her again. She answered:</p>
<p>"It required me to remain behind at St. Denis. <lb/>
I would have obeyed if I had been free, but I was <lb/>
helpless by my wound, and the knights carried me <lb/>
away by force."</p>
<p>"When were you wounded?"</p>
<p>"I was wounded in the moat before Paris, in the <lb/>
assault."</p>
<p>The next question reveals what Beaupere had been <lb/>
leading up to:</p>
<p>"Was it a feast day?"</p>
<p>You see? The suggestion is that a voice coming <lb/>
from God would hardly advise or permit the viola- <lb/>
tion, by war and bloodshed, of a sacred day.</p>
<p>Joan was troubled a moment, then she answered <lb/>
yes, it was a feast day.</p>
<p>"Now, then, tell me this: did you hold it right <lb/>
to make the attack on such a day?"</p>
<p>This was a shot which might make the first breach <lb/>
in a wall which had suffered no damage thus far. <lb/>
There was immediate silence in the court and intense <lb/>
expectancy noticeable all about. But Joan disap- <lb/>
pointed the house. She merely made a slight little <lb/>
motion with her hand, as when one brushes away a <lb/>
fly, and said with reposeful indifference:</p>
<p>"<foreign lang="fre"><i>Passez outre</i></foreign>."</p>
<pb n="160"/>
<p>Smiles danced for a moment in some of the stern- <lb/>
est faces there, and several even laughed outright. <lb/>
The trap had been long and laboriously prepared; it <lb/>
fell, and was empty.</p>
<p>The court rose. It had sat for hours, and was <lb/>
cruelly fatigued. Most of the time had been <lb/>
taken up with apparently idle and purposeless in- <lb/>
quiries about the Chinon events, the exiled Duke of <lb/>
Orleans, Joan's first proclamation, and so on, but <lb/>
all this seemingly random stuff had really been sown <lb/>
thick with hidden traps. But Joan had fortunately <lb/>
escaped them all, some by the protecting luck which <lb/>
attends upon ignorance and innocence, some by <lb/>
happy accident, the others by force of her best and <lb/>
surest helper, the clear vision and lightning intuitions <lb/>
of her extraordinary mind.</p>
<p>Now, then, this daily baiting and badgering of <lb/>
this friendless girl, a captive in chains, was to con- <lb/>
tinue a long, long time&#x2014;dignified sport, a kennel <lb/>
of mastiffs and bloodhounds harassing a kitten!&#x2014; <lb/>
and I may as well tell you, upon sworn testimony, <lb/>
what it was like from the first day to the last. When <lb/>
poor Joan had been in her grave a quarter of a <lb/>
century, the Pope called together that great court <lb/>
which was to re-examine her history, and whose just <lb/>
verdict cleared her illustrious name from every spot <lb/>
and stain, and laid upon the verdict and conduct of <lb/>
our Rouen tribunal the blight of its everlasting exe- <lb/>
crations. Manchon and several of the judges who <lb/>
had been members of our court were among the <lb/>
<pb n="161"/>
witnesses who appeared before that Tribunal of <lb/>
Rehabilitation. Recalling these miserable proceed- <lb/>
ings which I have been telling you about, Manchon <lb/>
testified thus:&#x2014;here you have it, all in fair print in <lb/>
the official history: <lb/>
<q>When Joan spoke of her apparitions she was interrupted at almost <lb/>
every word. They wearied her with long and multiplied interrogatories <lb/>
upon all sorts of things. Almost every day the interrogatories of the <lb/>
morning lasted <i>three or four hours;</i> then from these morning-inter- <lb/>
rogatories they extracted the particularly difficult and subtle points, and <lb/>
these served as material for the afternoon-interrogatories, which lasted <lb/>
<i>two or three hours</i>. Moment by moment they skipped from one subject <lb/>
to another; yet in spite of this <i>she always responded with an astonish- <lb/>
ing wisdom and memory</i>. She often corrected the judges, saying, <lb/>
"But I have already answered that once before&#x2014;ask the recorder," <lb/>
referring them to me.</q></p>
<p>And here is the testimony of one of Joan's <lb/>
judges. Remember, these witnesses are not talking <lb/>
about two or three days, they are talking about a <lb/>
tedious long <i>procession</i> of days: <lb/>
<q>They asked her profound questions, but she extricated herself quite <lb/>
well. Sometimes the questioners changed suddenly and passed to <lb/>
another subject <i>to see if she would not contradict herself</i>. They bur- <lb/>
dened her with long interrogatories of two or three hours, from which <lb/>
<i>the judges themselves went forth fatigued</i>. From the snares with which <lb/>
she was beset <i>the expertest man in the world could not have extricated <lb/>
himself but with difficulty</i>. She gave her responses with great pru- <lb/>
dence; indeed to such a degree that during <i>three weeks I believed <lb/>
she was inspired</i>.</q></p>
<p>Ah, had she a mind such as I have described? <lb/>
You see what these priests say under oath&#x2014;picked <lb/>
men, men chosen for their places in that terrible <lb/>
court on account of their learning, their experience, <lb/>
<pb n="162"/>
their keen and practiced intellects, and their strong <lb/>
bias against the prisoner. They make that poor <lb/>
young country girl out the match, and more than <lb/>
the match, of the sixty-two trained adepts. Isn't it <lb/>
so? They from the University of Paris, she from <lb/>
the sheepfold and the cow-stable! Ah, yes, she <lb/>
was great, she was wonderful. It took six thousand <lb/>
years to produce her; her like will not be seen in <lb/>
the earth again in fifty thousand. Such is my <lb/>
opinion.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VII">
<pb n="163"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER VII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> third meeting of the court was in that same <lb/>
spacious chamber, next day, 24th of February.</p>
<p>How did it begin work? In just the same old <lb/>
way. When the preparations were ended, the robed <lb/>
sixty-two massed in their chairs and the guards and <lb/>
order-keepers distributed to their stations, Cauchon <lb/>
spoke from his throne and commanded Joan to lay <lb/>
her hands upon the Gospels and swear to tell the <lb/>
truth concerning everything asked her!</p>
<p>Joan's eyes kindled, and she rose; rose and stood, <lb/>
fine and noble, and faced toward the Bishop and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Take care what you do, my Lord, you who are <lb/>
my judge, for you take a terrible responsibility on <lb/>
yourself and you presume too far."</p>
<p>It made a great stir, and Cauchon burst out upon <lb/>
her with an awful threat&#x2014;the threat of instant con- <lb/>
demnation unless she obeyed. That made the very <lb/>
bones in my body turn cold, and I saw cheeks about <lb/>
me blanch&#x2014;for it meant fire and the stake! But <lb/>
Joan, still standing, answered him back, proud and <lb/>
undismayed:</p>
<pb n="164"/>
<p>"Not all the clergy in Paris and Rouen could con- <lb/>
demn me, lacking the right!"</p>
<p>This made a great tumult, and part of it was ap- <lb/>
plause from the spectators. Joan resumed her seat. <lb/>
The Bishop still insisted. Joan said:</p>
<p>"I have already made oath. It is enough."</p>
<p>The Bishop shouted:</p>
<p>"In refusing to swear, you place yourself under <lb/>
suspicion!"</p>
<p>"Let be. I have sworn already. It is enough."</p>
<p>The Bishop continued to insist. Joan answered <lb/>
that "she would tell what she knew&#x2014;but not all <lb/>
that she knew."</p>
<p>The Bishop plagued her straight along, till at last <lb/>
she said, in a weary tone:</p>
<p>"I came from God; I have nothing more to do <lb/>
here. Return me to God, from whom I came."</p>
<p>It was piteous to hear; it was the same as saying, <lb/>
"You only want my life; take it and let me be at <lb/>
peace."</p>
<p>The Bishop stormed out again:</p>
<p>"Once more I command you to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Joan cut in with a nonchalant <i>"<foreign lang="fre">Passez outr&#x00E9;</foreign>,"</i> and <lb/>
Cauchon retired from the struggle; but he retired <lb/>
with some credit this time, for he offered a compro- <lb/>
mise, and Joan, always clear-headed, saw protection <lb/>
for herself in it and promptly and willingly accepted <lb/>
it. She was to swear to tell the truth "as touching <lb/>
the matters set down in the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal</i></foreign>." They <lb/>
could not sail her outside of definite limits, now; <lb/>
<pb n="165"/>
her course was over a charted sea, henceforth. The <lb/>
Bishop had granted more than he had intended, and <lb/>
more than he would honestly try to abide by.</p>
<p>By command, Beaupere resumed his examination <lb/>
of the accused. It being Lent, there might be a <lb/>
chance to catch her neglecting some detail of her <lb/>
religious duties. I could have told him he would <lb/>
fail there. Why, religion was her life!</p>
<p>"Since when have you eaten or drunk?"</p>
<p>If the least thing had passed her lips in the nature <lb/>
of sustenance, neither her youth nor the fact that she <lb/>
was being half starved in her prison could save her <lb/>
from dangerous suspicion of contempt for the com- <lb/>
mandments of the Church.</p>
<p>"I have done neither since yesterday at noon."</p>
<p>The priest shifted to the Voices again.</p>
<p>"When have you heard your Voice?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday and to-day."</p>
<p>"At what time?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday it was in the morning."</p>
<p>"What were you doing then?"</p>
<p>"I was asleep and it woke me."</p>
<p>"By touching your arm?"</p>
<p>"No; without touching me."</p>
<p>"Did you thank it? Did you kneel?"</p>
<p>He had Satan in his mind, you see; and was hop- <lb/>
ing, perhaps, that by and by it could be shown that <lb/>
she had rendered homage to the arch enemy of God <lb/>
and man.</p>
<p>"Yes, I thanked it; and knelt in my bed where I <lb/>
<pb n="166"/>
was chained, and joined my hands and begged it to <lb/>
implore God's help for me so that I might have light <lb/>
and instruction as touching the answers I should give <lb/>
here."</p>
<p>"Then what did the Voice say?"</p>
<p>"It told me to answer boldly, and God would help <lb/>
me." Then she turned toward Cauchon and said, <lb/>
"You say that you are my judge; now I tell <lb/>
you again, take care what you do, for in truth <lb/>
I am sent of God and you are putting yourself in <lb/>
great danger."</p>
<p>Beaupere asked her if the Voice's counsels were <lb/>
not fickle and variable.</p>
<p>"No. It never contradicts itself. This very day <lb/>
it has told me again to answer boldly."</p>
<p>"Has it forbidden you to answer only part of <lb/>
what is asked you?"</p>
<p>"I will tell you nothing as to that. I have <lb/>
revelations touching the King my master, and those <lb/>
I will not tell you." Then she was stirred by a <lb/>
great emotion, and the tears sprang to her eyes and <lb/>
she spoke out as with strong conviction, saying:</p>
<p>"I believe wholly&#x2014;as wholly as I believe the <lb/>
Christian faith and that God has redeemed us from <lb/>
the fires of hell, that God speaks to me by that <lb/>
Voice!"</p>
<p>Being questioned further concerning the Voice, <lb/>
she said she was not at liberty to tell all she knew.</p>
<p>"Do you think God would be displeased at your <lb/>
telling the whole truth?"</p>
<pb n="167"/>
<p>"The Voice has commanded me to tell the King <lb/>
certain things, and not you&#x2014;and some very lately <lb/>
&#x2014;even last night; things which I would he knew. <lb/>
He would be more easy at his dinner."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't the Voice speak to the King itself, <lb/>
as it did when you were with him? Would it not if <lb/>
you asked it?"</p>
<p>"I do not know if it be the wish of God." She <lb/>
was pensive a moment or two, busy with her <lb/>
thoughts and far away, no doubt; then she added a <lb/>
remark in which Beaupere, always watchful, always <lb/>
alert, detected a possible opening&#x2014;a chance to set <lb/>
a trap. Do you think he jumped at it instantly, be- <lb/>
traying the joy he had in his find, as a young hand at <lb/>
craft and artifice would do? No, oh, no, you could <lb/>
not tell that he had noticed the remark at all. He <lb/>
slid indifferently away from it at once, and began to <lb/>
ask idle questions about other things, so as to slip <lb/>
around and spring on it from behind, so to speak: <lb/>
tedious and empty questions as to whether the Voice <lb/>
had told her she would escape from this prison; and <lb/>
if it had furnished answers to be used by her in to- <lb/>
day's seance; if it was accompanied with a glory of <lb/>
light; if it had eyes, etc. That risky remark of <lb/>
Joan's was this:</p>
<p>"Without the Grace of God I could do nothing."</p>
<p>The court saw the priest's game, and watched his <lb/>
play with a cruel eagerness. Poor Joan was grown <lb/>
dreamy and absent; possibly she was tired. Her <lb/>
life was in imminent danger, and she did not suspect <lb/>
<pb n="168"/>
it. The time was ripe now, and Beaupere quietly <lb/>
and stealthily sprung his trap:</p>
<p>"Are you in a state of Grace?"</p>
<p>Ah, we had two or three honorable brave men in <lb/>
that pack of judges; and Jean Lefevre was one of <lb/>
them. He sprang to his feet and cried out:</p>
<p>"It is a terrible question! The accused is not <lb/>
obliged to answer it!"</p>
<p>Cauchon's face flushed black with anger to see <lb/>
this plank flung to the perishing child, and he <lb/>
shouted:</p>
<p>"Silence! and take your seat. The accused will <lb/>
answer the question!"</p>
<p>There was no hope, no way out of the dilemma; <lb/>
for whether she said yes or whether she said no, it <lb/>
would be all the same&#x2014;a disastrous answer, for <lb/>
the Scriptures had said one <i>cannot know</i> this thing. <lb/>
Think what hard hearts they were to set this fatal <lb/>
snare for that ignorant young girl and be proud of <lb/>
such work and happy in it. It was a miserable <lb/>
moment for me while we waited; it seemed a year. <lb/>
All the house showed excitement; and mainly it <lb/>
was glad excitement. Joan looked out upon these <lb/>
hungering faces with innocent, untroubled eyes, and <lb/>
then humbly and gently she brought out that im- <lb/>
mortal answer which brushed the formidable snare <lb/>
away as it had been but a cobweb:</p>
<p>"<i>If I be not in a state of Grace, I pray God <lb/>
place me in it; if I be in it, I pray God keep me so.</i>"</p>
<p>Ah, you will never see an effect like that; no, not <lb/>
<pb n="169"/>
while you live. For a space there was the silence of <lb/>
the grave. Men looked wondering into each other's <lb/>
faces, and some were awed and crossed themselves; <lb/>
and I heard Lefevre mutter:</p>
<p>"It was beyond the wisdom of man to devise that <lb/>
answer. <i>Whence</i> come this child's amazing inspira- <lb/>
tions?"</p>
<p>Beaupere presently took up his work again, but <lb/>
the humiliation of his defeat weighed upon him, and <lb/>
he made but a rambling and dreary business of it, he <lb/>
not being able to put any heart in it.</p>
<p>He asked Joan a thousand questions about her <lb/>
childhood and about the oak wood, and the fairies, <lb/>
and the children's games and romps under our dear <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre"><i>Arbre F&#x00E9;e de Bourlemont</i></foreign>, and this stirring up of old <lb/>
memories broke her voice and made her cry a little, <lb/>
but she bore up as well as she could, and answered <lb/>
everything.</p>
<p>Then the priest finished by touching again upon <lb/>
the matter of her apparel&#x2014;a matter which was <lb/>
never to be lost sight of in this still-hunt for this in- <lb/>
nocent creature's life, but kept always hanging over <lb/>
her, a menace charged with mournful possibilities:</p>
<p>"Would you like a woman's dress?"</p>
<p>"Indeed yes, if I may go out from this prison&#x2014; <lb/>
but here, no."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER VIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> court met next on Monday the 27th. Would <lb/>
you believe it? The Bishop ignored the con- <lb/>
tract limiting the examination to matters set down in <lb/>
the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal</i></foreign> and again commanded Joan to take <lb/>
the oath without reservations. She said:</p>
<p>"You should be content I have sworn enough."</p>
<p>She stood her ground, and Cauchon had to yield.</p>
<p>The examination was resumed, concerning Joan's <lb/>
Voices.</p>
<p>"You have said that you recognized them as <lb/>
being the voices of angels the third time that you <lb/>
heard them. What angels were they?"</p>
<p>"St. Catherine and St. Marguerite."</p>
<p>"How did you know that it was those two saints? <lb/>
How could you tell the one from the other?"</p>
<p>"I know it was they; and I know how to <lb/>
distinguish them."</p>
<p>"By what sign?"</p>
<p>"By their manner of saluting me. I have been <lb/>
these seven years under their direction, and I <lb/>
knew who they were because they told me."</p>
<p>"Whose was the first Voice that came to you <lb/>
when you were thirteen years old?"</p>
<pb n="171"/>
<p>"It was the Voice of St. Michael. I saw him be- <lb/>
fore my eyes; and he was not alone, but attended <lb/>
by a cloud of angels."</p>
<p>"Did you see the archangel and the attendant <lb/>
angels in the body, or in the spirit?"</p>
<p>"I saw them with the eyes of my body, just as I <lb/>
see you; and when they went away I cried because <lb/>
they did not take me with them."</p>
<p>It made me see that awful shadow again that fell <lb/>
dazzling white upon her that day under <foreign lang="fre"><i>l' Arbre F&#x00E9;e <lb/>
de Bourlemont</i></foreign>, and it made me shiver again, though <lb/>
it was so long ago. It was really not very long gone <lb/>
by, but it seemed so, because so much had hap- <lb/>
pened since.</p>
<p>"In what shape and form did St. Michael <lb/>
appear?"</p>
<p>"As to that, I have not received permission to <lb/>
speak."</p>
<p>"What did the archangel say to you that first <lb/>
time?"</p>
<p>"I cannot answer you to-day."</p>
<p>Meaning, I think, that she would have to get per- <lb/>
mission of her Voices first.</p>
<p>Presently, after some more questions as to the <lb/>
revelations which had been conveyed through her to <lb/>
the King, she complained of the unnecessity of all <lb/>
this, and said:</p>
<p>"I will say again, as I have said before many <lb/>
times in these sittings, that I answered all questions <lb/>
of this sort before the court at Poitiers, and I would <lb/>
<pb n="172"/>
that you would bring here the record of that court <lb/>
and read from that. Prithee, send for that book."</p>
<p>There was no answer. It was a subject that had <lb/>
to be got around and put aside. That book had <lb/>
wisely been gotten out of the way, for it contained <lb/>
things which would be very awkward here. Among <lb/>
them was a decision that Joan's mission was from <lb/>
God, whereas it was the intention of this inferior <lb/>
court to show that it was from the devil; also a de- <lb/>
cision permitting Joan to wear male attire, whereas it <lb/>
was the purpose of this court to make the male attire <lb/>
do hurtful work against her.</p>
<p>"How was it that you were moved to come into <lb/>
France&#x2014;by your own desire?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and by command of God. But that it was <lb/>
His will I would not have come. I would sooner <lb/>
have had my body torn in sunder by horses than <lb/>
come, lacking that."</p>
<p>Beaupere shifted once more to the matter of the <lb/>
male attire, now, and proceeded to make a solemn <lb/>
talk about it. That tried Joan's patience; and pres- <lb/>
ently she interrupted and said:</p>
<p>"It is a trifling thing and of no consequence. <lb/>
And I did not put it on by counsel of any man, <lb/>
but by command of God."</p>
<p>"Robert de Baudricourt did not order you to <lb/>
wear it?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Do you think you did well in taking the dress of <lb/>
a man?"</p>
<pb n="173"/>
<p>"I did well to do whatsoever thing God com- <lb/>
manded me to do."</p>
<p>"But in this particular case do you think you did <lb/>
well in taking the dress of a man?"</p>
<p>"I have done nothing but by command of <lb/>
God."</p>
<p>Beaupere made various attempts to lead her into <lb/>
contradictions of herself; also to put her words and <lb/>
acts in disaccord with the Scriptures. But it was <lb/>
lost time. He did not succeed. He returned to <lb/>
her visions, the light which shone about them, her <lb/>
relations with the King, and so on.</p>
<p>"Was there an angel above the King's head the <lb/>
first time you saw him?"</p>
<p>"By the Blessed Mary!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>She forced her impatience down, and finished her <lb/>
sentence with tranquillity: "If there was one I did <lb/>
not see it."</p>
<p>"Was there light?"</p>
<p>"There were more than three hundred soldiers <lb/>
there, and five hundred torches, without taking ac- <lb/>
count of spiritual light."</p>
<p>"What made the King believe in the revelations <lb/>
which you brought him?"</p>
<p>"He had signs; also the counsel of the clergy."</p>
<p>"What revelations were made to the King?"</p>
<p>"You will not get that out of me this year."</p>
<p>Presently she added: "During three weeks I was <lb/>
questioned by the clergy at Chinon and Poitiers. <lb/>
The King had a sign before he would believe; and <lb/>
<pb n="174"/>
the clergy were of opinion that my acts were good <lb/>
and not evil."</p>
<p>The subject was dropped now for a while, and <lb/>
Beaupere took up the matter of the miraculous sword <lb/>
of Fierbois to see if he could not find a chance there <lb/>
to fix the crime of sorcery upon Joan.</p>
<p>"How did you know that there was an ancient <lb/>
sword buried in the ground under the rear of the <lb/>
altar of the church of St. Catherine of Fierbois?"</p>
<p>Joan had no concealments to make as to this:</p>
<p>"I knew the sword was there because my Voices <lb/>
told me so; and I sent to ask that it be given to me <lb/>
to carry in the wars. It seemed to me that it was <lb/>
not very deep in the ground. The clergy of the <lb/>
church caused it to be sought for and dug up; and <lb/>
they polished it, and the rust fell easily off from it."</p>
<p>"Were you wearing it when you were taken in <lb/>
battle at Compi&#x00E8;gne?"</p>
<p>"No. But I wore it constantly until I left St. <lb/>
Denis after the attack upon Paris."</p>
<p>This sword, so mysteriously discovered and so <lb/>
long and so constantly victorious, was suspected of <lb/>
being under the protection of enchantment.</p>
<p>"Was that sword blest? What blessing had been <lb/>
invoked upon it?"</p>
<p>"None. I loved it because it was found in the <lb/>
church of St. Catherine, for I loved that church very <lb/>
dearly."</p>
<p>She loved it because it had been built in honor of <lb/>
one of her angels.</p>
<pb n="175"/>
<p>"Didn't you lay it upon the altar, to the end that <lb/>
it might be lucky?" (The altar of St. Denis.)</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Didn't you pray that it might be made lucky?"</p>
<p>"Truly it were no harm to wish that my harness <lb/>
might be fortunate."</p>
<p>"Then it was not that sword which you wore in <lb/>
the field of Compi&#x00E8;gne? What sword did you <lb/>
wear there?"</p>
<p>"The sword of the Burgundian Franquet d'Arras, <lb/>
whom I took prisoner in the engagement at Lagny. <lb/>
I kept it because it was a good war-sword&#x2014;good <lb/>
to lay on stout thumps and blows with."</p>
<p>She said that quite simply; and the contrast be- <lb/>
tween her delicate little self and the grim soldier- <lb/>
words which she dropped with such easy familiarity <lb/>
from her lips made many spectators smile.</p>
<p>"What is become of the other sword? Where is <lb/>
it now?"</p>
<p>"Is that in the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal?</i></foreign>"</p>
<p>Beaupere did not answer.</p>
<p>"Which do you love best, your banner or your <lb/>
sword?"</p>
<p>Her eye lighted gladly at the mention of her ban- <lb/>
ner, and she cried out:</p>
<p>"I love my banner best&#x2014;oh, forty times more <lb/>
than the sword! Sometimes I carried it myself <lb/>
when I charged the enemy, to avoid killing any- <lb/>
one." Then she added, na&#x00EF;vely, and with again <lb/>
that curious contrast between her girlish little per- <lb/>
<pb n="176"/>
sonality and her subject, "I have never killed any- <lb/>
one."</p>
<p>It made a great many smile; and no wonder, when <lb/>
you consider what a gentle and innocent little thing <lb/>
she looked. One could hardly believe she had ever <lb/>
even seen men slaughtered, she looked so little fitted <lb/>
for such things.</p>
<p>"In the final assault at Orleans did you tell your <lb/>
soldiers that the arrows shot by the enemy and the <lb/>
stones discharged from their catapults and cannon <lb/>
would not strike any one but you?"</p>
<p>"No. And the proof is, that more than a hun- <lb/>
dred of my men were struck. I told them to have <lb/>
no doubts and no fears; that they would raise the <lb/>
siege. I was wounded in the neck by an arrow in <lb/>
the assault upon the bastille that commanded the <lb/>
bridge, but St. Catherine comforted me and I was <lb/>
cured in fifteen days without having to quit the <lb/>
saddle and leave my work."</p>
<p>"Did you know that you were going to be <lb/>
wounded?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and I had told it to the King beforehand. <lb/>
I had it from my Voices."</p>
<p>"When you took Jargeau, why did you not put <lb/>
its commandant to ransom?"</p>
<p>"I offered him leave to go out unhurt from the <lb/>
place, with all his garrison; and if he would not I <lb/>
would take it by storm."</p>
<p>"And you did, I believe."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<pb n="177"/>
<p>"Had your Voices counseled you to take it by <lb/>
storm?"</p>
<p>"As to that, I do not remember."</p>
<p>Thus closed a weary long sitting, without result. <lb/>
Every device that could be contrived to trap Joan <lb/>
into wrong thinking, wrong doing, or disloyalty to <lb/>
the Church, or sinfulness as a little child at home or <lb/>
later had been tried, and none of them had suc- <lb/>
ceeded. She had come unscathed through the <lb/>
ordeal.</p>
<p>Was the court discouraged? No. Naturally it <lb/>
was very much surprised, very much astonished, to <lb/>
find its work baffling and difficult instead of simple <lb/>
and easy, but it had powerful allies in the shape of <lb/>
hunger, cold, fatigue, persecution, deception, and <lb/>
treachery; and opposed to this array nothing but a <lb/>
defenseless and ignorant girl who must some time or <lb/>
other surrender to bodily and mental exhaustion or <lb/>
get caught in one of the thousand traps set for her.</p>
<p>And had the court made no progress during these <lb/>
seemingly resultless sittings? Yes. It had been <lb/>
feeling its way, groping here, groping there, and had <lb/>
found one or two vague trails which might freshen <lb/>
by and by and lead to something. The male attire, <lb/>
for instance, and the visions and Voices. Of course <lb/>
no one doubted that she had seen supernatural beings <lb/>
and been spoken to and advised by them. And of <lb/>
course no one doubted that by supernatural help <lb/>
miracles had been done by Joan, such as choosing <lb/>
out the King in a crowd when she had never seen <lb/>
<pb n="178"/>
him before, and her discovery of the sword buried <lb/>
under the altar. It would have been foolish to <lb/>
doubt these things, for we all know that the air is <lb/>
full of devils and angels that are visible to traffickers <lb/>
in magic on the one hand and to the stainlessly holy <lb/>
on the other; but what many and perhaps most did <lb/>
doubt was, that Joan's visions, voices, and miracles <lb/>
came from God. It was hoped that in time they <lb/>
could be proven to have been of satanic origin. <lb/>
Therefore, as you see, the court's persistent fashion <lb/>
of coming back to that subject every little while and <lb/>
spooking around it and prying into it was not to <lb/>
pass the time&#x2014;it had a strictly business end in <lb/>
view.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IX">
<pb n="179"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER IX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> next sitting opened on Thursday the first of <lb/>
March. Fifty-eight judges present&#x2014;the others <lb/>
resting.</p>
<p>As usual, Joan was required to take an oath with- <lb/>
out reservations. She showed no temper this time. <lb/>
She considered herself well buttressed by the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces <lb/>
verbal</i></foreign> compromise which Cauchon was so anxious <lb/>
to repudiate and creep out of; so she merely re- <lb/>
fused, distinctly and decidedly; and added, in a <lb/>
spirit of fairness and candor:</p>
<p>"But as to matters set down in the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal</i></foreign>, <lb/>
I will freely tell the whole truth&#x2014;yes, as freely and <lb/>
fully as if I were before the Pope."</p>
<p>Here was a chance! We had two or three Popes, <lb/>
then; only one of them could be the true Pope, of <lb/>
course. Everybody judiciously shirked the question <lb/>
of <i>which</i> was the true Pope and refrained from nam- <lb/>
ing him, it being clearly dangerous to go into par- <lb/>
ticulars in this matter. Here was an opportunity to <lb/>
trick an unadvised girl into bringing herself into <lb/>
peril, and the unfair judge lost no time in taking ad- <lb/>
vantage of it. He asked, in a plausibly indolent and <lb/>
absent way:</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>"Which one do you consider to be the true <lb/>
Pope?"</p>
<p>The house took an attitude of deep attention, and <lb/>
so waited to hear the answer and see the prey walk <lb/>
into the trap. But when the answer came it covered <lb/>
the judge with confusion, and you could see many <lb/>
people covertly chuckling. For Joan asked in a <lb/>
voice and manner which almost deceived even me, <lb/>
so innocent it seemed:</p>
<p>"Are there two?"</p>
<p>One of the ablest priests in that body and one of <lb/>
the best swearers there, spoke right out so that half <lb/>
the house heard him, and said:</p>
<p>"By God, it was a master stroke!"</p>
<p>As soon as the judge was better of his embarrass- <lb/>
ment he came back to the charge, but was prudent <lb/>
and passed by Joan's question:</p>
<p>"Is it true that you received a letter from the <lb/>
Count of Armagnac asking you which of the three <lb/>
Popes he ought to obey?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and answered it."</p>
<p>Copies of both letters were produced and read. <lb/>
Joan said that hers had not been quite strictly copied. <lb/>
She said she had received the Count's letter when <lb/>
she was just mounting her horse; and added:</p>
<p>"So, in dictating a word or two of reply I said I <lb/>
would try to answer him from Paris or somewhere <lb/>
where I could be at rest."</p>
<p>She was asked again which Pope she had con- <lb/>
sidered the right one.</p>
<pb n="181"/>
<p>"I was not able to instruct the Count of Armagnac <lb/>
as to which one he ought to obey;" then she <lb/>
added, with a frank fearlessness which sounded fresh <lb/>
and wholesome in that den of trimmers and shufflers, <lb/>
"but as for me, I hold that we are bound to obey <lb/>
our Lord the Pope who is at Rome."</p>
<p>The matter was dropped. Then they produced <lb/>
and read a copy of Joan's first effort at dictating&#x2014; <lb/>
her proclamation summoning the English to retire <lb/>
from the siege of Orleans and vacate France&#x2014;truly <lb/>
a great and fine production for an unpracticed girl <lb/>
of seventeen.</p>
<p>"Do you acknowledge as your own the document <lb/>
which has just been read?"</p>
<p>"Yes, except that there are errors in it&#x2014;words <lb/>
which make me give myself too much importance." <lb/>
I saw what was coming; I was troubled and <lb/>
ashamed. "For instance, I did not say 'Deliver up <lb/>
to the Maid' (<foreign lang="fre"><i>rendez &#x00E0; la Pucelle</i></foreign>); I said 'Deliver <lb/>
up to the King' (<foreign lang="fre"><i>rendez au Roi</i></foreign>); and I did not call <lb/>
myself 'Commander-in-Chief' (<foreign lang="fre"><i>chef de guerre</i></foreign>). <lb/>
All those are words which my secretary substituted; <lb/>
or mayhap he misheard me or forgot what I said."</p>
<p>She did not look at me when she said it: she <lb/>
spared me that embarrassment. I hadn't misheard <lb/>
her at all, and hadn't forgotten. I changed her <lb/>
language purposely, for she <i>was</i> Commander-in- <lb/>
Chief and entitled to call herself so, and it was <lb/>
becoming and proper, too; and who was going <lb/>
to surrender anything to the King?&#x2014;at that time a <lb/>
<pb n="182"/>
stick, a cipher? If any surrendering was done, it <lb/>
would be to the noble Maid of Vaucouleurs, already <lb/>
famed and formidable though she had not yet struck <lb/>
a blow.</p>
<p>Ah, there would have been a fine and disagreeable <lb/>
episode (for me) there, if that pitiless court had <lb/>
discovered that the very scribbler of that piece of <lb/>
dictation, secretary to Joan of Arc, was present&#x2014; <lb/>
and not only present, but helping build the record; <lb/>
and not only that, but destined at a far distant day <lb/>
to testify against lies and perversions smuggled into <lb/>
it by Cauchon and deliver them over to eternal <lb/>
infamy!</p>
<p>"Do you acknowledge that you dictated this <lb/>
proclamation?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Have you repented of it? Do you retract it?"</p>
<p>Ah, then she was indignant!</p>
<p>"No! Not even these chains"&#x2014;and she shook <lb/>
them&#x2014;"not even these chains can chill the hopes <lb/>
that I uttered there. And more!"&#x2014;she rose, and <lb/>
stood a moment with a divine strange light kindling <lb/>
in her face, then her words burst forth as in a flood <lb/>
&#x2014;"I warn you now that before seven years a <lb/>
disaster will smite the English, oh, many fold greater <lb/>
than the fall of Orleans! and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Silence! Sit down!"</p>
<p>"&#x2014;and then, soon after, they will lose all France!"</p>
<p>Now consider these things. The French armies <lb/>
no longer existed. The French cause was standing <lb/>
<pb n="183"/>
still, our King was standing still, there was no hint <lb/>
that by and by the Constable Richemont would <lb/>
come forward and take up the great work of Joan of <lb/>
Arc and finish it. In face of all this, Joan made <lb/>
that prophecy&#x2014;made it with perfect confidence&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>and it came true</i>.</p>
<p>For within five years Paris fell&#x2014;1436&#x2014;and our <lb/>
King marched into it flying the victor's flag. So <lb/>
the first part of the prophecy was then fulfilled&#x2014;in <lb/>
fact, almost the entire prophecy; for, with Paris <lb/>
in our hands, the fulfillment of the rest of it was <lb/>
assured.</p>
<p>Twenty years later all France was ours excepting a <lb/>
single town&#x2014;Calais.</p>
<p>Now that will remind you of an earlier prophecy of <lb/>
Joan's. At the time that she wanted to take Paris <lb/>
and could have done it with ease if our King had but <lb/>
consented, she said that that was the golden time; <lb/>
that, with Paris ours, all France would be ours in six <lb/>
months. But if this golden opportunity to recover <lb/>
France was wasted, said she, "<i>I give you twenty <lb/>
years to do it in</i>."</p>
<p>She was right. After Paris fell, in 1436, the rest <lb/>
of the work had to be done city by city, castle by <lb/>
castle, and it took twenty years to finish it.</p>
<p>Yes, it was the first day of March, 1431, there in <lb/>
the court, that she stood in the view of everybody <lb/>
and uttered that strange and incredible prediction. <lb/>
Now and then, in this world, somebody's prophecy <lb/>
turns up correct, but when you come to look into it <lb/>
<pb n="184"/>
there is sure to be considerable room for suspicion <lb/>
that the prophecy was made after the fact. But <lb/>
here the matter is different. There in that court <lb/>
Joan's prophecy was set down in the official record <lb/>
at the hour and moment of its utterance, years be- <lb/>
fore the fulfillment, and there you may read it to this <lb/>
day. Twenty-five years after Joan's death the <lb/>
record was produced in the great Court of the <lb/>
Rehabilitation and verified under oath by Manchon <lb/>
and me, and surviving judges of our court confirmed <lb/>
the exactness of the record in their testimony.</p>
<p>Joan's startling utterance on that now so celebrated <lb/>
first of March stirred up a great turmoil, and it was <lb/>
some time before it quieted down again. Naturally, <lb/>
everybody was troubled, for a prophecy is a grisly <lb/>
and awful thing, whether one thinks it ascends from <lb/>
hell or comes down from heaven. All that these <lb/>
people felt sure of was, that the inspiration back of <lb/>
it was genuine and puissant. They would have given <lb/>
their right hands to know the source of it.</p>
<p>At last the questions began again.</p>
<p>"How do you know that those things are going to <lb/>
happen?"</p>
<p>"I know it by revelation. And I know it as surely <lb/>
as I know that you sit here before me."</p>
<p>This sort of answer was not going to allay the <lb/>
spreading uneasiness. Therefore, after some further <lb/>
dallying the judge got the subject out of the way and <lb/>
took up one which he could enjoy more.</p>
<p>"What language do your Voices speak?"</p>
<pb n="185"/>
<p>"French."</p>
<p>"St. Marguerite, too?"</p>
<p>"Verily; why not? She is on our side, not on <lb/>
the English?"</p>
<p>Saints and angels who did not condescend to speak <lb/>
English! a grave affront. They could not be <lb/>
brought into court and punished for contempt, but <lb/>
the tribunal could take silent note of Joan's remark <lb/>
and remember it against her; which they did. It <lb/>
might be useful by and by.</p>
<p>"Do your saints and angels wear jewelry?&#x2014; <lb/>
crowns, rings, earrings?"</p>
<p>To Joan, questions like this were profane frivolities <lb/>
and not worthy of serious notice; she answered in- <lb/>
differently. But the question brought to her mind <lb/>
another matter, and she turned upon Cauchon and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"I had two rings. They have been taken away <lb/>
from me during my captivity. You have one of <lb/>
them. It is the gift of my brother. Give it back to <lb/>
me. If not to me, then I pray that it be given to <lb/>
the Church."</p>
<p>The judges conceived the idea that maybe these <lb/>
rings were for the working of enchantments. Per- <lb/>
haps they could be made to do Joan a damage.</p>
<p>"Where is the other ring?"</p>
<p>"The Burgundians have it."</p>
<p>"Where did you get it?"</p>
<p>"My father and mother gave it to me."</p>
<p>"Describe it."</p>
<pb n="186"/>
<p>"It is plain and simple and has '<i>Jesus and <lb/>
Mary</i>' engraved upon it."</p>
<p>Everybody could see that that was not a valuable <lb/>
equipment to do devil's work with. So that trail <lb/>
was not worth following. Still, to make sure, one <lb/>
of the judges asked Joan if she had ever cured sick <lb/>
people by touching them with the ring. She said <lb/>
no.</p>
<p>"Now as concerning the fairies, that were used <lb/>
to abide near by Domremy whereof there are <lb/>
many reports and traditions. It is said that your <lb/>
godmother surprised these creatures on a summer's <lb/>
night dancing under the tree called <foreign lang="fre"><i>l'Arbre F&#x00E9;e de <lb/>
Bourlemont</i></foreign>. Is it not possible that your pretended <lb/>
saints and angels are but those fairies?"</p>
<p>"Is that in your <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces?</i></foreign>"</p>
<p>She made no other answer.</p>
<p>"Have you not conversed with St. Marguerite <lb/>
and St. Catherine under that tree?"</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>"Or by the fountain near the tree?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sometimes."</p>
<p>"What promises did they make you?"</p>
<p>"None but such as they had God's warrant for."</p>
<p>"But what promises <i>did</i> they make?"</p>
<p>"That is not in your <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces;</i></foreign> yet I will say this <lb/>
much: they told me that the King would become <lb/>
master of his kingdom in spite of his enemies."</p>
<p>"And what else?"</p>
<p>There was a pause; then she said humbly:</p>
<pb n="187"/>
<p>"They promised to lead me to Paradise."</p>
<p>If faces do really betray what is passing in men's <lb/>
minds, a fear came upon many in that house, at this <lb/>
time, that maybe, after all, a chosen servant and <lb/>
herald of God was here being hunted to her death. <lb/>
The interest deepened. Movements and whisper- <lb/>
ings ceased: the stillness became almost painful.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that almost from the beginning <lb/>
the nature of the questions asked Joan showed that <lb/>
in some way or other the questioner very often <lb/>
already knew his fact before he asked his question? <lb/>
Have you noticed that somehow or other the ques- <lb/>
tioners usually knew just how and where to search <lb/>
for Joan's secrets; that they really knew the bulk of <lb/>
her privacies&#x2014;a fact not suspected by her&#x2014;and <lb/>
that they had no task before them but to trick her <lb/>
into exposing those secrets?</p>
<p>Do you remember Loyseleur, the hypocrite, the <lb/>
treacherous priest, tool of Cauchon? Do you re- <lb/>
member that under the sacred seal of the confes- <lb/>
sional Joan freely and trustingly revealed to him <lb/>
everything concerning her history save only a few <lb/>
things regarding her supernatural revelations which <lb/>
her Voices had forbidden her to tell to anyone&#x2014;and <lb/>
that the unjust judge, Cauchon, was a hidden listener <lb/>
all the time?</p>
<p>Now you understand how the inquisitors were able <lb/>
to devise that long array of minutely prying ques- <lb/>
tions; questions whose subtlety and ingenuity and <lb/>
penetration are astonishing until we come to remem- <lb/>
<pb n="188"/>
ber Loyseleur's performance and recognize their <lb/>
source. Ah, Bishop of Beauvais, you are now <lb/>
lamenting this cruel iniquity these many years in <lb/>
hell! Yes verily, unless one has come to your help. <lb/>
There is but one among the redeemed that would do <lb/>
it; and it is futile to hope that that one has not <lb/>
already done it&#x2014;Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>We will return to the court and the questionings.</p>
<p>"Did they make you still another promise?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but that is not in your <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces</i></foreign>. I will not tell <lb/>
it now, but before three months I will tell it you."</p>
<p>The judge seems to know the matter he is asking <lb/>
about, already; one gets this idea from his next <lb/>
question.</p>
<p>"Did your Voices tell you that you would be <lb/>
liberated before three months?"</p>
<p>Joan often showed a little flash of surprise at the <lb/>
good guessing of the judges, and she showed one <lb/>
this time. I was frequently in terror to find my <lb/>
mind (which <i>I</i> could not control) criticising the <lb/>
Voices and saying, "They counsel her to speak <lb/>
boldly&#x2014;a thing which she would do without any <lb/>
suggestion from <i>them</i> or anybody else&#x2014;but when <lb/>
it comes to telling her any useful thing, such as how <lb/>
these conspirators manage to guess their way so <lb/>
skillfully into her affairs, they are always off attend- <lb/>
ing to some other business."</p>
<p>I am reverent by nature; and when such thoughts <lb/>
swept through my head they made me cold with fear, <lb/>
and if there was a storm and thunder at the time, I <lb/>
<pb n="189"/>
was so ill that I could but with difficulty abide at <lb/>
my post and do my work.</p>
<p>Joan answered:</p>
<p>"That is not in your <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces</i></foreign>. I do not know <lb/>
when I shall be set free, but some who wish me out <lb/>
of this world will go from it before me."</p>
<p>It made some of them shiver.</p>
<p>"Have your Voices told you that you will be de- <lb/>
livered from this prison?"</p>
<p>Without a doubt they had, and the judge knew it <lb/>
before he asked the question.</p>
<p>"Ask me again in three months and I will tell <lb/>
you." She said it with such a happy look, the <lb/>
tired prisoner! And I? And No&#x00EB;l Rainguesson, <lb/>
drooping yonder?&#x2014;why, the floods of joy went <lb/>
streaming through us from crown to sole! It was <lb/>
all that we could do to hold still and keep from mak- <lb/>
ing fatal exposure of our feelings.</p>
<p>She was to be set free in three months. That was <lb/>
what she meant; we saw it. The Voices had told <lb/>
her so, and told her true&#x2014;true to the very day&#x2014; <lb/>
May 30th. But we know now that they had merci- <lb/>
fully hidden from her <i>how</i> she was to be set free, <lb/>
but left her in ignorance. Home again! That was <lb/>
our understanding of it&#x2014;No&#x00EB;l's and mine; that <lb/>
was our dream; and now we would count the days, <lb/>
the hours, the minutes. They would fly lightly <lb/>
along; they would soon be over. Yes, we would <lb/>
carry our idol home; and there, far from the pomps <lb/>
and tumults of the world, we would take up our <lb/>
<pb n="190"/>
happy life again and live it out as we had begun it, <lb/>
in the free air and the sunshine, with the friendly sheep <lb/>
and the friendly people for comrades, and the grace <lb/>
and charm of the meadows, the woods, and the river <lb/>
always before our eyes and their deep peace in our <lb/>
hearts. Yes, that was our dream, the dream that <lb/>
carried us bravely through that three months to an <lb/>
exact and awful fulfillment, the thought of which <lb/>
would have killed us, I think, if we had foreknown <lb/>
it and been obliged to bear the burden of it upon <lb/>
our hearts the half of those heavy days.</p>
<p>Our reading of the prophecy was this: We be- <lb/>
lieved the King's soul was going to be smitten with <lb/>
remorse; and that he would privately plan a rescue <lb/>
with Joan's old lieutenants, D'Alen&#x00E7;on and the <lb/>
Bastard and La Hire, and that this rescue would take <lb/>
place at the end of the three months. So we made <lb/>
up our minds to be ready and take a hand in it.</p>
<p>In the present and also in later sittings Joan was <lb/>
urged to name the exact day of her deliverance; but <lb/>
she could not do that. She had not the permission <lb/>
of her Voices. Moreover, the Voices themselves did <lb/>
not name the precise day. Ever since the fulfillment <lb/>
of the prophecy, I have believed that Joan had the <lb/>
idea that her deliverance was going to come in the <lb/>
form of death. But not <i>that</i> death! Divine as she <lb/>
was, dauntless as she was in battle, she was human <lb/>
also. She was not solely a saint, an angel, she was <lb/>
a claymade girl also&#x2014;as human a girl as any in the <lb/>
world, and full of a human girl's sensitivenesses and <lb/>
<pb n="191"/>
tendernesses and delicacies. And so, <i>that</i> death! <lb/>
No, she could not have lived the three months with <lb/>
that one before her, I think. You remember that <lb/>
the first time she was wounded she was frightened, <lb/>
and cried, just as any other girl of seventeen would <lb/>
have done, although she had known for eighteen <lb/>
days that she was going to be wounded on that very <lb/>
day. No, she was not afraid of any ordinary death, <lb/>
and an ordinary death was what she believed the <lb/>
prophecy of deliverance meant, I think, for her face <lb/>
showed happiness, not horror, when she uttered it.</p>
<p>Now I will explain why I think as I do. Five <lb/>
weeks before she was captured in the battle of Com- <lb/>
pi&#x00E8;gne, her Voices told her what was coming. They <lb/>
did not tell her the day or the place, but said she <lb/>
would be taken prisoner and that it would be before <lb/>
the feast of St. John. She begged that death, cer- <lb/>
tain and swift, should be her fate, and the captivity <lb/>
brief; for she was a free spirit, and dreaded the con- <lb/>
finement. The Voices made no promise, but only <lb/>
told her to bear whatever came. Now as they did <lb/>
not <i>refuse</i> the swift death, a hopeful young thing <lb/>
like Joan would naturally cherish that fact and make <lb/>
the most of it, allowing it to grow and establish itself <lb/>
in her mind. And so now that she was told she was <lb/>
to be "delivered" in three months, I think she be- <lb/>
lieved it meant that she would die in her bed in the <lb/>
prison, and that that was why she looked happy <lb/>
and content&#x2014;the gates of Paradise standing open <lb/>
for her, the time so short, you see, her troubles so <lb/>
<pb n="192"/>
soon to be over, her reward so close at hand. Yes, <lb/>
that would make her look happy, that would make <lb/>
her patient and bold, and able to fight her fight out <lb/>
like a soldier. Save herself if she could, of course, <lb/>
and try her best, for that was the way she was made; <lb/>
but die with her face to the front if die she must.</p>
<p>Then later, when she charged Cauchon with trying <lb/>
to kill her with a poisoned fish, her notion that <lb/>
she was to be "delivered" by death in the prison <lb/>
&#x2014;if she had it, and I believe she had&#x2014;would <lb/>
naturally be greatly strengthened, you see.</p>
<p>But I am wandering from the trial. Joan was <lb/>
asked to definitely name the time that she would be <lb/>
delivered from prison.</p>
<p>"I have always said that I was not permitted to <lb/>
tell you everything. I am to be set free, and I de- <lb/>
sire to ask leave of my Voices to tell you the day. <lb/>
This is why I wish for delay."</p>
<p>"Do your Voices forbid you to tell the truth?"</p>
<p>"Is it that you wish to know matters concerning <lb/>
the King of France? I tell you again that he will <lb/>
regain his kingdom, and that I know it as well as I <lb/>
know that you sit here before me in this tribunal." <lb/>
She sighed and, after a little pause, added: "I <lb/>
should be dead but for this revelation, which com- <lb/>
forts me always."</p>
<p>Some trivial questions were asked her about St. <lb/>
Michael's dress and appearance. She answered <lb/>
them with dignity, but one saw that they gave her <lb/>
pain. After a little she said:</p>
<pb n="193"/>
<p>"I have great joy in seeing him, for when I see <lb/>
him I have the feeling that I am not in mortal sin." <lb/>
She added, "Sometimes St. Marguerite and St. <lb/>
Catherine have allowed me to confess myself to <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>Here was a possible chance to set a successful <lb/>
snare for her innocence.</p>
<p>"When you confessed were you in mortal sin, do <lb/>
you think?"</p>
<p>But her reply did her no hurt. So the inquiry <lb/>
was shifted once more to the revelations made to the <lb/>
King&#x2014;secrets which the court had tried again and <lb/>
again to force out of Joan, but without success.</p>
<p>"Now as to the sign given to the King&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I have already told you that I will tell you noth- <lb/>
ing about it."</p>
<p>"Do you know what the sign was?"</p>
<p>"As to that, you will not find out from me."</p>
<p>All this refers to Joan's secret interview with the <lb/>
King&#x2014;held apart, though two or three others were <lb/>
present. It was known&#x2014;through Loyseleur, of <lb/>
course&#x2014;that this sign was a crown and was a pledge <lb/>
of the verity of Joan's mission. But that is all a <lb/>
mystery until this day&#x2014;the nature of the crown, I <lb/>
mean&#x2014;and will remain a mystery to the end of <lb/>
time. We can never know whether a real crown de- <lb/>
scended upon the King's head, or only a symbol, <lb/>
the mystic fabric of a vision.</p>
<p>"Did you see a crown upon the King's head <lb/>
when he received the revelation?"</p>
<pb n="194"/>
<p>"I cannot tell you as to that, without perjury."</p>
<p>"Did the King have that crown at Rheims?"</p>
<p>"I think the King put upon his head a crown <lb/>
which he found there; but a much richer one was <lb/>
brought him afterwards."</p>
<p>"Have you seen that one?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you, without perjury. But whether <lb/>
I have seen it or not, I have heard say that it was <lb/>
rich and magnificent."</p>
<p>They went on and pestered her to weariness about <lb/>
that mysterious crown, but they got nothing more <lb/>
out of her. The sitting closed. A long, hard day <lb/>
for all of us.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER X.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> court rested a day, then took up work again <lb/>
on Saturday the third of March.</p>
<p>This was one of our stormiest sessions. The <lb/>
whole court was out of patience; and with good <lb/>
reason. These three-score distinguished churchmen, <lb/>
illustrious tacticians, veteran legal gladiators, had <lb/>
left important posts where their supervision was <lb/>
needed, to journey hither from various regions and <lb/>
accomplish a most simple and easy matter&#x2014;con- <lb/>
demn and send to death a country lass of nineteen <lb/>
who could neither read nor write, knew nothing of <lb/>
the wiles and perplexities of legal procedure, could <lb/>
call not a single witness in her defense, was allowed <lb/>
no advocate or adviser, and must conduct her case <lb/>
by herself against a hostile judge and a packed jury. <lb/>
In two hours she would be hopelessly entangled, <lb/>
routed, defeated, convicted. Nothing could be more <lb/>
certain than this&#x2014;so they thought. But it was a <lb/>
mistake. The two hours had strung out into days; <lb/>
what promised to be a skirmish had expanded into <lb/>
a siege; the thing which had looked so easy had <lb/>
proven to be surprisingly difficult; the light victim <lb/>
<pb n="196"/>
who was to have been puffed away like a feather <lb/>
remained planted like a rock; and on top of all this, <lb/>
if anybody had a right to laugh it was the country <lb/>
lass and not the court.</p>
<p>She was not doing that, for that was not her <lb/>
spirit; but others were doing it. The whole town <lb/>
was laughing in its sleeve, and the court knew it, <lb/>
and its dignity was deeply hurt. The members <lb/>
could not hide their annoyance.</p>
<p>And so, as I have said, the session was stormy. <lb/>
It was easy to see that these men had made up their <lb/>
minds to force words from Joan to-day which should <lb/>
shorten up her case and bring it to a prompt con- <lb/>
clusion. It shows that after all their experience <lb/>
with her they did not know her yet. They went <lb/>
into the battle with energy. They did not leave the <lb/>
questioning to a particular member; no, everybody <lb/>
helped. They volleyed questions at Joan from all <lb/>
over the house, and sometimes so many were talking <lb/>
at once that she had to ask them to deliver their fire <lb/>
one at a time and not by platoons. The beginning <lb/>
was as usual:</p>
<p>"You are once more required to take the oath <lb/>
pure and simple."</p>
<p>"I will answer to what is in the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal</i></foreign>. <lb/>
When I do more, I will choose the occasion for <lb/>
myself."</p>
<p>That old ground was debated and fought over <lb/>
inch by inch with great bitterness and many threats. <lb/>
But Joan remained steadfast, and the questionings <lb/>
<pb n="197"/>
had to shift to other matters. Half an hour was <lb/>
spent over Joan's apparitions&#x2014;their dress, hair, <lb/>
general appearance, and so on&#x2014;in the hope of <lb/>
fishing something of a damaging sort out of the <lb/>
replies; but with no result.</p>
<p>Next, the male attire was reverted to, of course. <lb/>
After many well-worn questions had been re-asked, <lb/>
one or two new ones were put forward.</p>
<p>"Did not the King or the Queen sometimes ask <lb/>
you to quit the male dress?"</p>
<p>"That is not in your <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces</i></foreign>."</p>
<p>"Do you think you would have sinned if you had <lb/>
taken the dress of your sex?"</p>
<p>"I have done best to serve and obey my sovereign <lb/>
Lord and Master."</p>
<p>After a while the matter of Joan's Standard was <lb/>
taken up, in the hope of connecting magic and <lb/>
witchcraft with it.</p>
<p>"Did not your men copy your banner in their <lb/>
pennons?"</p>
<p>"The lancers of my guard did it. It was to dis- <lb/>
tinguish them from the rest of the forces. It was <lb/>
their own idea."</p>
<p>"Were they often renewed?"</p>
<p>"Yes. When the lances were broken they were <lb/>
renewed."</p>
<p>The purpose of the questions unveils itself in the <lb/>
next one.</p>
<p>"Did you not say to your men that pennons <lb/>
made like your banner would be lucky?"</p>
<pb n="198"/>
<p>The soldier-spirit in Joan was offended at this <lb/>
puerility. She drew herself up, and said with dig- <lb/>
nity and fire: "What I said to them was, 'Ride <lb/>
these English down!' and I did it myself."</p>
<p>Whenever she flung out a scornful speech like that <lb/>
at these French menials in English livery it lashed <lb/>
them into a rage; and that is what happened this <lb/>
time. There were ten, twenty, sometimes even <lb/>
thirty of them on their feet at a time, storming at <lb/>
the prisoner minute after minute, but Joan was not <lb/>
disturbed.</p>
<p>By and by there was peace, and the inquiry was <lb/>
resumed.</p>
<p>It was now sought to turn against Joan the thou- <lb/>
sand loving honors which had been done her when <lb/>
she was raising France out of the dirt and shame of <lb/>
a century of slavery and castigation.</p>
<p>"Did you not cause paintings and images of <lb/>
yourself to be made?"</p>
<p>"No. At Arras I saw a painting of myself <lb/>
kneeling in armor before the King and delivering him <lb/>
a letter; but I caused no such things to be made."</p>
<p>"Were not masses and prayers said in your <lb/>
honor?"</p>
<p>"If it was done it was not by my command. But <lb/>
if any prayed for me I think it was no harm."</p>
<p>"Did the French people believe you were sent of <lb/>
God?"</p>
<p>"As to that, I know not; but whether they be- <lb/>
lieved it or not, I was not the less sent of God."</p>
<pb n="199"/>
<p>"If they thought you were sent of God do you <lb/>
think it was well thought?"</p>
<p>"If they believed it, their trust was not abused."</p>
<p>"What impulse was it, think you, that moved the <lb/>
people to kiss your hands, your feet, and your vest- <lb/>
ments?"</p>
<p>"They were glad to see me, and so they did those <lb/>
things; and I could not have prevented them if I <lb/>
had had the heart. Those poor people came <lb/>
lovingly to me because I had not done them any <lb/>
hurt, but had done the best I could for them ac- <lb/>
cording to my strength."</p>
<p>See what modest little words she uses to describe <lb/>
that touching spectacle, her marches about France <lb/>
walled in on both sides by the adoring multitudes: <lb/>
"They were glad to see me." Glad? Why, they <lb/>
were transported with joy to see her. When they <lb/>
could not kiss her hands or her feet, they knelt in <lb/>
the mire and kissed the hoof-prints of her horse. <lb/>
They worshiped her; and that is what these priests <lb/>
were trying to prove. It was nothing to them <lb/>
that she was not to blame for what other people <lb/>
did. No, if she was worshiped, it was enough; <lb/>
she was guilty of mortal sin. Curious logic, one <lb/>
must say.</p>
<p>"Did you not stand sponsor for some children <lb/>
baptized at Rheims?"</p>
<p>"At Troyes I did, and at St. Denis; and I <lb/>
named the boys Charles, in honor of the King, and <lb/>
the girls I named Joan."</p>

<p>"Did not women touch their rings to those which <lb/>
you wore?"</p>
<p>"Yes, many did, but I did not know their reason <lb/>
for it."</p>
<p>"At Rheims was your Standard carried into the <lb/>
church? Did you stand at the altar with it in your <lb/>
hand at the Coronation?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In passing through the country did you confess <lb/>
yourself in the churches and receive the sacrament?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In the dress of a man?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But I do not remember that I was in <lb/>
armor."</p>
<p>It was almost a concession! almost a half-sur- <lb/>
render of the permission granted her by the Church <lb/>
at Poitiers to dress as a man. The wily court shifted <lb/>
to another matter: to pursue this one at this time <lb/>
might call Joan's attention to her small mistake, and <lb/>
by her native cleverness she might recover her lost <lb/>
ground. The tempestuous session had worn her <lb/>
and drowsed her alertness.</p>
<p>"It is reported that you brought a dead child to <lb/>
life in the church at Lagny. Was that in answer to <lb/>
your prayers?"</p>
<p>"As to that, I have no knowledge. Other young <lb/>
girls were praying for the child, and I joined them <lb/>
and prayed also, doing no more than they."</p>
<p>"Continue."</p>
<p>"While we prayed it came to life, and cried. It <lb/>
<pb n="201"/>
had been dead three days, and was as black as my <lb/>
doublet. It was straightway baptized, then it passed <lb/>
from life again and was buried in holy ground."</p>
<p>"Why did you jump from the tower of Beaurevoir <lb/>
by night and try to escape?"</p>
<p>"I would go to the succor of Compi&#x00E8;gne."</p>
<p>It was insinuated that this was an attempt to <lb/>
commit the deep crime of suicide to avoid falling <lb/>
into the hands of the English.</p>
<p>"Did you not say that you would rather die than <lb/>
be delivered into the power of the English?"</p>
<p>Joan answered frankly; without perceiving the <lb/>
trap:</p>
<p>"Yes; my words were, that I would rather that <lb/>
my soul be returned unto God than that I should <lb/>
fall into the hands of the English."</p>
<p>It was now insinuated that when she came to, <lb/>
after jumping from the tower, she was angry and <lb/>
blasphemed the name of God; and that she did it <lb/>
again when she heard of the defection of the Com- <lb/>
mandant of Soissons. She was hurt and indignant <lb/>
at this, and said:</p>
<p>"It is not true. I have never cursed. It is not <lb/>
my custom to swear."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Ahalt</smcap> was called. It was time. Cauchon was <lb/>
losing ground in the fight, Joan was gaining <lb/>
it. There were signs that here and there in the <lb/>
court a judge was being softened toward Joan by <lb/>
her courage, her presence of mind, her fortitude, <lb/>
her constancy, her piety, her simplicity and candor, <lb/>
her manifest purity, the nobility of her character, <lb/>
her fine intelligence, and the good brave fight she <lb/>
was making, all friendless and alone, against unfair <lb/>
odds, and there was grave room for fear that this <lb/>
softening process would spread further and presently <lb/>
bring Cauchon's plans in danger.</p>
<p>Something must be done, and it was done. <lb/>
Cauchon was not distinguished for compassion, but <lb/>
he now gave proof that he had it in his character. <lb/>
He thought it pity to subject so many judges to the <lb/>
prostrating fatigues of this trial when it could be <lb/>
conducted plenty well enough by a handful of them. <lb/>
Oh, gentle Judge! But he did not remember to <lb/>
modify the fatigues for the little captive.</p>
<p>He would let all the judges but a handful go, but <lb/>
he would select the handful himself, and he did. <lb/>
<pb n="203"/>
He chose tigers. If a lamb or two got in, it was by <lb/>
oversight, not intention; and he knew what to do <lb/>
with lambs when discovered.</p>
<p>He called a small council now, and during five <lb/>
days they sifted the huge bulk of answers thus far <lb/>
gathered from Joan. They winnowed it of all chaff, <lb/>
all useless matter&#x2014;that is, all matter favorable to <lb/>
Joan; they saved up all matter which could be <lb/>
twisted to her hurt, and out of this they constructed <lb/>
a basis for a new trial which should have the sem- <lb/>
blance of a continuation of the old one. Another <lb/>
change. It was plain that the public trial had <lb/>
wrought damage: its proceedings had been dis- <lb/>
cussed all over the town and had moved many to <lb/>
pity the abused prisoner. There should be no more <lb/>
of that. The sittings should be secret hereafter, <lb/>
and no spectators admitted. So No&#x00EB;l could come <lb/>
no more. I sent this news to him. I had not the <lb/>
heart to carry it myself. I would give the pain a <lb/>
chance to modify before I should see him in the <lb/>
evening.</p>
<p>On the 10th of March the secret trial began. A <lb/>
week had passed since I had seen Joan. Her ap- <lb/>
pearance gave me a great shock. She looked tired <lb/>
and weak. She was listless and far away, and her <lb/>
answers showed that she was dazed and not able to <lb/>
keep perfect run of all that was done and said. <lb/>
Another court would not have taken advantage of <lb/>
her state, seeing that her life was at stake here, but <lb/>
would have adjourned and spared her. Did this <lb/>
<pb n="204"/>
one? No; it worried her for hours, and with a <lb/>
glad and eager ferocity, making all it could out of <lb/>
this great chance, the first one it had had.</p>
<p>She was tortured into confusing herself concern- <lb/>
ing the "sign" which had been given the King, and <lb/>
the next day this was continued hour after hour. <lb/>
As a result, she made partial revealments of particu- <lb/>
lars forbidden by her Voices; and seemed to me to <lb/>
state as facts things which were but allegories and <lb/>
visions mixed with facts.</p>
<p>The third day she was brighter, and looked less <lb/>
worn. She was almost her normal self again, and <lb/>
did her work well. Many attempts were made to <lb/>
beguile her into saying indiscreet things, but she <lb/>
saw the purpose in view and answered with tact and <lb/>
wisdom.</p>
<p>"Do you know if St. Catherine and St. Mar- <lb/>
guerite hate the English?"</p>
<p>"They love whom Our Lord loves, and hate <lb/>
whom He hates."</p>
<p>"Does God hate the English?"</p>
<p>"Of the love or the hatred of God toward the <lb/>
English I know nothing." Then she spoke up with <lb/>
the old martial ring in her voice and the old audacity <lb/>
in her words, and added, "But I know this&#x2014;that <lb/>
God will send victory to the French, and that all the <lb/>
English will be flung out of France but the dead <lb/>
ones!"</p>
<p>"Was God on the side of the English when they <lb/>
were <i>prosperous</i> in France?"</p>
<pb n="205"/>
<p>"I do not know if God hates the French, but I <lb/>
think that he allowed them to be chastised for their <lb/>
sins."</p>
<p>It was a sufficiently na&#x00EF;ve way to account for a <lb/>
chastisement which had now strung out for ninety- <lb/>
six years. But nobody found fault with it. There <lb/>
was nobody there who would not punish a sinner <lb/>
ninety-six years if he could, nor anybody there who <lb/>
would ever dream of such a thing as the Lord's <lb/>
being any shade less stringent than men.</p>
<p>"Have you ever embraced St. Marguarite and <lb/>
St. Catherine?"</p>
<p>"Yes, both of them."</p>
<p>The evil face of Cauchon betrayed satisfaction <lb/>
when she said that.</p>
<p>"When you hung garlands upon <foreign lang="fre"><i>L'Arbre F&#x00E9;e de <lb/>
Bourlemont</i></foreign>, did you do it in honor of your appari- <lb/>
tions?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Satisfaction again. No doubt Cauchon would <lb/>
take it for granted that she hung them there out of <lb/>
sinful love for the fairies.</p>
<p>"When the saints appeared to you did you bow, <lb/>
did you make reverence, did you kneel?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I did them the most honor and the most <lb/>
reverence that I could."</p>
<p>A good point for Cauchon if he could eventually <lb/>
make it appear that these were no saints to whom <lb/>
she had done reverence, but devils in disguise.</p>
<p>Now there was the matter of Joan's keeping her <lb/>
<pb n="206"/>
supernatural commerce a secret from her parents. <lb/>
Much might be made of that. In fact, particular <lb/>
emphasis had been given to it in a private remark <lb/>
written in the margin of the <i><foreign lang="dut">proces:</foreign> "She concealed <lb/>
her visions from her parents and from every one."</i> <lb/>
Possibly this disloyalty to her parents might itself <lb/>
be the sign of the satanic source of her mission.</p>
<p>"Do you think it was right to go away to <lb/>
the wars without getting your parents' leave? It <lb/>
is written one must honor his father and his <lb/>
mother."</p>
<p>"I have obeyed them in all things but that. And <lb/>
for that I have begged their forgiveness in a letter <lb/>
and gotten it."</p>
<p>"Ah, you asked their pardon? So you <i>knew</i> <lb/>
you were guilty of sin in going without their leave!"</p>
<p>Joan was stirred. Her eyes flashed, and she ex- <lb/>
claimed:</p>
<p>"I was commanded of God, and it was right to <lb/>
go! If I had had a hundred fathers and mothers <lb/>
and been a king's daughter to boot I would have <lb/>
gone."</p>
<p>"Did you never ask your Voices if you might tell <lb/>
your parents?"</p>
<p>"They were willing that I should tell them, but I <lb/>
would not for anything have given my parents that <lb/>
pain."</p>
<p>To the minds of the questioners this headstrong <lb/>
conduct savored of pride. That sort of pride would <lb/>
move one to seek sacrilegious adorations.</p>
<pb n="207"/>
<p>"Did not your Voices call you Daughter of <lb/>
God?"</p>
<p>Joan answered with simplicity, and unsuspiciously:</p>
<p>"Yes; before the siege of Orleans and since, they <lb/>
have several times called me Daughter of God."</p>
<p>Further indications of pride and vanity were <lb/>
sought.</p>
<p>"What horse were you riding when you were <lb/>
captured? Who gave it you?"</p>
<p>"The King."</p>
<p>"You had other things&#x2014;riches&#x2014;of the King?"</p>
<p>"For myself I had horses and arms, and money <lb/>
to pay the service in my household."</p>
<p>"Had you not a treasury?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Ten or twelve thousand crowns." Then <lb/>
she said with na&#x00EF;vet&#x00E9;, "It was not a great sum to <lb/>
carry on a war with."</p>
<p>"You have it yet?"</p>
<p>"No. It is the King's money. My brothers <lb/>
hold it for him."</p>
<p>"What were the arms which you left as an offer- <lb/>
ing in the church of St. Denis?"</p>
<p>"My suit of silver mail and a sword."</p>
<p>"Did you put them there in order that they <lb/>
might be adored?"</p>
<p>"No. It was but an act of devotion. And it is <lb/>
the custom of men of war who have been wounded <lb/>
to make such offering there. I had been wounded <lb/>
before Paris."</p>
<p><i>Nothing</i> appealed to those stony hearts, those dull <lb/>
<pb n="208"/>
imaginations&#x2014;not even this pretty picture, so sim- <lb/>
ply drawn, of the wounded girl-soldier hanging her <lb/>
toy harness there in curious companionship with the <lb/>
grim and dusty iron mail of the historic defenders of <lb/>
France. No, there was nothing in it for them; <lb/>
nothing, unless evil and injury for that innocent <lb/>
creature could be gotten out of it somehow.</p>
<p>"Which aided most&#x2014;you the Standard, or the <lb/>
Standard you?"</p>
<p>"Whether it was the Standard or whether it was <lb/>
I, is nothing&#x2014;the victories came from God."</p>
<p>"But did you base your hopes of victory in your- <lb/>
self or in your Standard?"</p>
<p>"In neither. In God, and not otherwhere."</p>
<p>"Was not your Standard waved around the King's <lb/>
head at the Coronation?"</p>
<p>"No. It was not."</p>
<p>"Why was it that <i>your</i> Standard had place at the <lb/>
crowning of the King in the Cathedral of Rheims, <lb/>
rather than those of the other captains?"</p>
<p>Then, soft and low, came that touching speech <lb/>
which will live as long as language lives, and pass <lb/>
into all tongues, and move all gentle hearts where- <lb/>
soever it shall come, down to the latest day:</p>
<p>"<i>It had borne the burden, it had earned the <lb/>
honor</i>."<ref target="n5">*</ref><note id="n5" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>What she said has been many times translated, but never with <lb/>
success. There is a haunting pathos about the original which eludes <lb/>
all efforts to convey it into our tongue. It is as subtle as an odor, and <lb/>
escapes in the transmission. Her words were these:</p>
<p>"<foreign lang="fre"><i>Il avait &#x00E9;t&#x00E9; a la peine, c'etait bien raison qu'il fut a l' honneur</i></foreign>."</p>
<p>Monseigneur Ricard, Honorary Vicar-General to the Archbishop of <lb/>
Aix, finely speaks of it ("<foreign lang="fre"><i>Jeanne d' Arc la V&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;rable</i></foreign>," page 197) as <lb/>
"that sublime reply, enduring in the history of celebrated sayings like <lb/>
the cry of a French and Christian soul wounded unto death in its <lb/>
patriotism and its faith."&#x2014;<smcap>Translator</smcap>.</p></note></p>
<pb n="209"/>
<p>How simple it is, and how beautiful. And how <lb/>
it beggars the studied eloquence of the masters of <lb/>
oratory. Eloquence was a native gift of Joan of <lb/>
Arc; it came from her lips without effort and with- <lb/>
out preparation. Her words were as sublime as her <lb/>
deeds, as sublime as her character; they had their <lb/>
source in a great heart and were coined in a great <lb/>
brain.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="XII">
<pb n="210"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Now</smcap>, as a next move, this small secret court of <lb/>
holy assassins did a thing so base that even at <lb/>
this day, in my old age, it is hard to speak of it <lb/>
with patience.</p>
<p>In the beginning of her commerce with her Voices <lb/>
there at Domremy, the child Joan solemnly devoted <lb/>
her life to God, vowing her pure body and her pure <lb/>
soul to his service. You will remember that her <lb/>
parents tried to stop her from going to the wars by <lb/>
haling her to the court at Toul to compel her to <lb/>
make a marriage which she had never promised to <lb/>
make&#x2014;a marriage with our poor, good, windy, <lb/>
big, hard-fighting and most dear and lamented com- <lb/>
rade, the Standard-Bearer, who fell in honorable <lb/>
battle and sleeps in God these sixty years, peace to <lb/>
his ashes! And you will remember how Joan, six- <lb/>
teen years old, stood up in that venerable court and <lb/>
conducted her case all by herself, and tore the poor <lb/>
Paladin's case to rags and blew it away with a <lb/>
breath; and how the astonished old judge on the <lb/>
bench spoke of her as "this marvelous child."</p>
<p>You remember all that. Then think what I felt, <lb/>
to see these false priests, here in the tribunal wherein <lb/>
<pb n="211"/>
Joan had fought a fourth lone fight in three years, <lb/>
deliberately twist that matter entirely around and try <lb/>
to make out that Joan haled the Paladin into court <lb/>
and pretended that he had promised to marry her, <lb/>
and was bent on making him do it.</p>
<p>Certainly there was no baseness that those people <lb/>
were ashamed to stoop to in their hunt for that <lb/>
friendless girl's life. What they wanted to show <lb/>
was this&#x2014;that she had committed the sin of relaps- <lb/>
ing from her vow and trying to violate it.</p>
<p>Joan detailed the true history of the case, but lost <lb/>
her temper as she went along, and finished with <lb/>
some words for Cauchon which he remembers yet, <lb/>
whether he is fanning himself in the world he be- <lb/>
longs in or has swindled his way into the other.</p>
<p>The rest of this day and part of the next the <lb/>
court labored upon the old theme&#x2014;the male attire. <lb/>
It was shabby work for those grave men to be en- <lb/>
gaged in; for they well knew one of Joan's reasons <lb/>
for clinging to the male dress was, that soldiers of <lb/>
the guard were always present in her room whether <lb/>
she was asleep or awake, and that the male dress <lb/>
was a better protection for her modesty than the <lb/>
other.</p>
<p>The court knew that one of Joan's purposes had <lb/>
been the deliverance of the exiled Duke of Orleans, <lb/>
and they were curious to know how she had intended <lb/>
to manage it. Her plan was characteristically busi- <lb/>
ness-like, and her statement of it as characteristically <lb/>
simple and straightforward:</p>
<pb n="212"/>
<p>"I would have taken English prisoners enough in <lb/>
France for his ransom; and failing that, I would <lb/>
have invaded England and brought him out by <lb/>
force."</p>
<p>That was just her way. If a thing was to be done, <lb/>
it was love first, and hammer and tongs to follow; <lb/>
but no shilly-shallying between. She added with a <lb/>
little sigh:</p>
<p>"If I had had my freedom three years, I would <lb/>
have delivered him."</p>
<p>"Have you the permission of your Voices to <lb/>
break out of prison whenever you can?"</p>
<p>"I have asked their leave several times, but they <lb/>
have not given it."</p>
<p>I think it is as I have said, she expected the <lb/>
deliverance of death, and within the prison walls, <lb/>
before the three months should expire.</p>
<p>"Would you escape if you saw the doors open?"</p>
<p>She spoke up frankly and said:</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;for I should see in that the permission of <lb/>
Our Lord. God helps who help themselves, the <lb/>
proverb says. But except I thought I had per- <lb/>
mission, I would not go."</p>
<p>Now, then, at this point, something occurred <lb/>
which convinces me, every time I think of it&#x2014;and <lb/>
it struck me so at the time&#x2014;that for a moment, at <lb/>
least, her hopes wandered to the King, and put into <lb/>
her mind the same notion about her deliverance <lb/>
which No&#x00EB;l and I had settled upon&#x2014;a rescue by <lb/>
her old soldiers. I think the idea of the rescue did <lb/>
<pb n="213"/>
occur to her, but only as a passing thought, and that <lb/>
it quickly passed away.</p>
<p>Some remark of the Bishop of Beauvais moved <lb/>
her to remind him once more that he was an unfair <lb/>
judge, and had no right to preside there, and that he <lb/>
was putting himself in great danger.</p>
<p>"What danger?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I do not know. St. Catherine has promised <lb/>
me help, but I do not know the form of it. I do <lb/>
not know whether I am to be delivered from this <lb/>
prison or whether when you send me to the scaffold <lb/>
there will happen a trouble by which I shall be set <lb/>
free. Without much thought as to this matter, I <lb/>
am of the opinion that it may be one or the other." <lb/>
After a pause she added these words, memorable <lb/>
forever&#x2014;words whose meaning she may have mis- <lb/>
caught, misunderstood, as to that we can never <lb/>
know; words which she may have rightly under- <lb/>
stood; as to that also, we can never know; but words <lb/>
whose mystery fell away from them many a year <lb/>
ago and revealed their real meaning to all the world:</p>
<p>"But what my Voices have said clearest is, that I <lb/>
shall be delivered <i>by a great victory</i>." She paused, <lb/>
my heart was beating fast, for to me that great vic- <lb/>
tory meant the sudden bursting in of our old soldiers <lb/>
with war-cry and clash of steel at the last moment <lb/>
and the carrying off of Joan of Arc in triumph. <lb/>
But, oh, that thought had such a short life! For <lb/>
now she raised her head and finished, with those <lb/>
solemn words which men still so often quote and <lb/>
<pb n="214"/>
dwell upon&#x2014;words which filled me with fear, they <lb/>
sounded so like a prediction. "And always they <lb/>
say 'Submit to whatever comes; <i>do not grieve for <lb/>
your martyrdom;</i> from it you will ascend into the <lb/>
Kingdom of Paradise.'"</p>
<p>Was she thinking of fire and the stake? I think <lb/>
not. I thought of it myself, but I believe she was <lb/>
only thinking of this slow and cruel martyrdom of <lb/>
chains and captivity and insult. Surely, martyrdom <lb/>
was the right name for it.</p>
<p>It was Jean de la Fontaine who was asking the <lb/>
questions. He was willing to make the most he <lb/>
could out of what she had said:</p>
<p>"As the Voices have told you you are going to <lb/>
Paradise, you feel certain that that will happen and <lb/>
that you will not be damned in hell. Is that so?"</p>
<p>"I believe what they told me. I know that I <lb/>
shall be saved."</p>
<p>"It is a weighty answer."</p>
<p>"To me the knowledge that I shall be saved is <lb/>
a great treasure."</p>
<p>"Do you think that after that revelation you <lb/>
could be able to commit mortal sin?"</p>
<p>"As to that, I do not know. My hope for salva- <lb/>
tion is in holding fast to my oath to keep my body <lb/>
and my soul pure."</p>
<p>"Since you know you are to be saved do you <lb/>
think it necessary to go to confession?"</p>
<p>The snare was ingeniously devised, but Joan's <lb/>
simple and humble answer left it empty:</p>
<pb n="215"/>
<p>"One cannot keep his conscience too clean."</p>
<p>We were now arriving at the last day of this new <lb/>
trial. Joan had come through the ordeal well. It <lb/>
had been a long and wearisome struggle for all con- <lb/>
cerned. All ways had been tried to convict the ac- <lb/>
cused, and all had failed, thus far. The inquisitors <lb/>
were thoroughly vexed and dissatisfied. However, <lb/>
they resolved to make one more effort, put in one <lb/>
more day's work. This was done&#x2014;March 17th. <lb/>
Early in the sitting a notable trap was set for Joan:</p>
<p>"Will you submit to the determination of the <lb/>
Church all your words and deeds, whether good or <lb/>
bad?"</p>
<p>That was well planned. Joan was in imminent <lb/>
peril now. If she should heedlessly say yes, it <lb/>
would put her mission <i>itself</i> upon trial, and one <lb/>
would know how to decide its source and character <lb/>
promptly. If she should say no, she would render <lb/>
herself chargeable with the crime of heresy.</p>
<p>But she was equal to the occasion. She drew a <lb/>
distinct line of separation between the Church's <lb/>
authority over her as a subject member, and the <lb/>
matter of her <i>mission</i>. She said she loved the <lb/>
Church and was ready to support the Christian faith <lb/>
with all her strength; but as to the works done <lb/>
under her mission, those must be judged by God <lb/>
alone, who had commanded them to be done.</p>
<p>The judge still insisted that she submit them to <lb/>
the decision of the Church. She said:</p>
<p>"I will submit them to Our Lord who sent me. <lb/>
<pb n="216"/>
It would seem to me that He and His Church are <lb/>
one, and that there should be no difficulty about <lb/>
this matter." Then she turned upon the judge and <lb/>
said, "Why do you make a difficulty where there is <lb/>
no room for any?"</p>
<p>Then Jean de la Fontaine corrected her notion <lb/>
that there was but one Church. There were two&#x2014; <lb/>
the Church Triumphant, which is God, the saints, <lb/>
the angels, and the redeemed, and has its seat in <lb/>
heaven; and the Church Militant, which is our Holy <lb/>
Father the Pope, Vicar of God, the prelates, the <lb/>
clergy and all good Christians and Catholics, the <lb/>
which Church has its seat in the earth, is governed <lb/>
by the Holy Spirit, and cannot err. "Will you not <lb/>
submit those matters to the Church Militant?"</p>
<p>"I am come to the King of France from the <lb/>
Church Triumphant on high by its commandant, <lb/>
and to that Church I will submit all those things <lb/>
which I have done. For the Church Militant I have <lb/>
no other answer now."</p>
<p>The court took note of this straitly worded re- <lb/>
fusal, and would hope to get profit out of it; but <lb/>
the matter was dropped for the present, and a long <lb/>
chase was then made over the old hunting-ground&#x2014; <lb/>
the fairies, the visions, the male attire, and all that.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the satanic Bishop himself took <lb/>
the chair and presided over the closing scenes of <lb/>
the trial. Along toward the finish, this question <lb/>
was asked by one of the judges:</p>
<p>"You have said to my lord the Bishop that you <lb/>
<pb n="217"/>
would answer him as you would answer before our <lb/>
Holy Father the Pope, and yet there are several <lb/>
questions which you continually refuse to answer. <lb/>
Would you not answer the Pope more fully than <lb/>
you have answered before my lord of Beauvais? <lb/>
Would you not feel obliged to answer the Pope, <lb/>
who is the Vicar of God, more fully?"</p>
<p>Now fell a thunder-clap out of a clear sky:</p>
<p>"<i>Take me to the Pope</i>. I will answer to every- <lb/>
thing that I ought to."</p>
<p>It made the Bishop's purple face fairly blanch <lb/>
with consternation. If Joan had only known, if she <lb/>
had only known! She had lodged a mine under <lb/>
this black conspiracy able to blow the Bishop's <lb/>
schemes to the four winds of heaven, and she didn't <lb/>
know it. She had made that speech by mere in- <lb/>
stinct, not suspecting what tremendous forces were <lb/>
hidden in it, and there was none to tell her what she <lb/>
had done. I knew, and Manchon knew; and if she <lb/>
had known how to read writing we could have hoped <lb/>
to get the knowledge to her somehow; but speech <lb/>
was the only way, and none was allowed to approach <lb/>
her near enough for that. So there she sat, once <lb/>
more Joan of Arc the Victorious, but all unconscious <lb/>
of it. She was miserably worn and tired, by the <lb/>
long day's struggle and by illness, or she must have <lb/>
noticed the effect of that speech and divined the <lb/>
reason of it.</p>
<p>She had made many master-strokes, but this was <lb/>
<i>the</i> master-stroke. It was <i>an appeal to Rome</i>. It <lb/>
<pb n="218"/>
was her clear right; and if she had persisted in it <lb/>
Cauchon's plot would have tumbled about his ears <lb/>
like a house of cards, and he would have gone from <lb/>
that place the worst beaten man of the century. <lb/>
He was daring, but he was not daring enough to <lb/>
stand up against that demand if Joan had urged it. <lb/>
But no, she was ignorant, poor thing, and did not <lb/>
know what a blow she had struck for life and <lb/>
liberty.</p>
<p>France was not the Church. Rome had no <lb/>
interest in the destruction of this messenger of God. <lb/>
Rome would have given her a fair trial, and that <lb/>
was all that her cause needed. From that trial she <lb/>
would have gone forth free, and honored, and <lb/>
blessed.</p>
<p>But it was not so fated. Cauchon at once diverted <lb/>
the questions to other matters and hurried the trial <lb/>
quickly to an end.</p>
<p>As Joan moved feebly away, dragging her chains, <lb/>
I felt stunned and dazed, and kept saying to myself, <lb/>
"Such a little while ago she said the saving word <lb/>
and could have gone free; and now, there she goes <lb/>
to her death; yes, it is to her death, I know it, I <lb/>
feel it. They will double the guards; they will <lb/>
never let any come near her now between this and <lb/>
her condemnation, lest she get a hint and speak that <lb/>
word again. This is the bitterest day that has come <lb/>
to me in all this miserable time."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>So</smcap> the second trial in the prison was over. Over, <lb/>
and no definite result. The character of it I <lb/>
have described to you. It was baser in one par- <lb/>
ticular than the previous one; for this time the <lb/>
charges had not been communicated to Joan, there- <lb/>
fore she had been obliged to fight in the dark. <lb/>
There was no opportunity to do any thinking before- <lb/>
hand; there was no foreseeing what traps might be <lb/>
set, and no way to prepare for them. Truly it was <lb/>
a shabby advantage to take of a girl situated as this <lb/>
one was. One day, during the course of it, an able <lb/>
lawyer of Normandy, Ma&#x00EE;tre Lohier, happened to <lb/>
be in Rouen, and I will give you his opinion of that <lb/>
trial, so that you may see that I have been honest <lb/>
with you, and that my partisanship has not made <lb/>
me deceive you as to its unfair and illegal character. <lb/>
Cauchon showed Lohier the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces</i></foreign> and asked his <lb/>
opinion about the trial. Now this was the opinion <lb/>
which he gave to Cauchon. He said that the whole <lb/>
thing was null and void; for these reasons: <smcap>i</smcap>, be- <lb/>
cause the trial was secret, and full freedom of <lb/>
speech and action on the part of those present not <lb/>
<pb n="220"/>
possible; 2, because the trial touched the honor of <lb/>
the King of France, yet he was not summoned to <lb/>
defend himself, nor any one appointed to represent <lb/>
him; 3, because the charges against the prisoner <lb/>
were not communicated to her; 4, because the ac- <lb/>
cused, although young and simple, had been forced <lb/>
to defend her cause without help of counsel, not- <lb/>
withstanding she had so much at stake.</p>
<p>Did that please Bishop Cauchon? It did not. <lb/>
He burst out upon Lohier with the most savage <lb/>
cursings, and swore he would have him drowned. <lb/>
Lohier escaped from Rouen and got out of France <lb/>
with all speed, and so saved his life.</p>
<p>Well, as I have said, the second trial was over, <lb/>
without definite result. But Cauchon did not give <lb/>
up. He could trump up another. And still an- <lb/>
other and another, if necessary. He had the half- <lb/>
promise of an enormous prize&#x2014;the Archbishopric <lb/>
of Rouen&#x2014;if he should succeed in burning the <lb/>
body and damning to hell the soul of this young <lb/>
girl who had never done him any harm; and such a <lb/>
prize as that, to a man like the Bishop of Beauvais, <lb/>
was worth the burning and damning of fifty harm- <lb/>
less girls, let alone one.</p>
<p>So he set to work again straight off next day; <lb/>
and with high confidence, too, intimating with brutal <lb/>
cheerfulness that he should succeed this time. It <lb/>
took him and the other scavengers nine days to dig <lb/>
matter enough out of Joan's testimony and their own <lb/>
inventions to build up the new mass of charges. <lb/>
<pb n="221"/>
And it was a formidable mass indeed, for it num- <lb/>
bered sixty-six articles.</p>
<p>This huge document was carried to the castle the <lb/>
next day, March 27th; and there, before a dozen <lb/>
carefully-selected judges, the new trial was begun.</p>
<p>Opinions were taken, and the tribunal decided that <lb/>
Joan should hear the articles read this time. Maybe <lb/>
that was on account of Lohier's remark upon that <lb/>
head; or maybe it was hoped that the reading would <lb/>
kill the prisoner with fatigue&#x2014;for, as it turned out, <lb/>
this reading occupied several days. It was also <lb/>
decided that Joan should be required to answer <lb/>
squarely to every article, and that if she refused she <lb/>
should be considered <i>convicted</i>. You see, Cauchon <lb/>
was managing to narrow her chances more and more <lb/>
all the time; he was drawing the toils closer and <lb/>
closer.</p>
<p>Joan was brought in, and the Bishop of Beauvais <lb/>
opened with a speech to her which ought to have <lb/>
made even himself blush, so laden it was with <lb/>
hypocrisy and lies. He said that this court was <lb/>
composed of holy and pious churchmen whose <lb/>
hearts were full of benevolence and compassion <lb/>
toward her, and that they had no wish to hurt her <lb/>
body, but only a desire to instruct her and lead her <lb/>
into the way of truth and salvation.</p>
<p>Why, this man was born a devil; now think of <lb/>
his describing himself and those hardened slaves of <lb/>
his in such language as that.</p>
<p>And yet, worse was to come. For now having <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
in mind another of Lohier's hints, he had the cold <lb/>
effrontery to make to Joan a proposition which, I <lb/>
think, will surprise you when you hear it. He said <lb/>
that this court, recognizing her untaught estate and <lb/>
her inability to deal with the complex and difficult <lb/>
matters which were about to be considered, had de- <lb/>
termined, out of their pity and their mercifulness, <lb/>
to allow her to choose one or more persons <i>out of <lb/>
their own number</i> to help her with counsel and <lb/>
advice!</p>
<p>Think of that&#x2014;a court made up of Loyseleur <lb/>
and his breed of reptiles. It was granting leave to <lb/>
a lamb to ask help of a wolf. Joan looked up to <lb/>
see if he was serious, and perceiving that he was at <lb/>
least pretending to be, she declined, of course.</p>
<p>The Bishop was not expecting any other reply. <lb/>
He had made a show of fairness and could have it <lb/>
entered on the minutes, therefore he was satisfied.</p>
<p>Then he commanded Joan to answer straitly to <lb/>
every accusation; and threatened to cut her off from <lb/>
the Church if she failed to do that or delayed her <lb/>
answers beyond a given length of time. Yes, he <lb/>
was narrowing her chances down, step by step.</p>
<p>Thomas de Courcelles began the reading of that <lb/>
interminable document, article by article. Joan an- <lb/>
swered to each article in its turn; sometimes merely <lb/>
denying its truth, sometimes by saying her answer <lb/>
would be found in the records of the previous trials.</p>
<p>What a strange document that was, and what an <lb/>
exhibition and exposure of the heart of man, the <lb/>
<pb n="223"/>
one creature authorized to boast that he is made in <lb/>
the image of God. To know Joan of Arc was to <lb/>
know one who was wholly noble, pure, truthful, <lb/>
brave, compassionate, generous, pious, unselfish, <lb/>
modest, blameless as the very flowers in the fields&#x2014; <lb/>
a nature fine and beautiful, a character supremely <lb/>
great. To know her from that document would be <lb/>
to know her as the exact reverse of all that. Noth- <lb/>
ing that she <i>was</i> appears in it, everything that she <lb/>
was <i>not</i> appears there in detail.</p>
<p>Consider some of the things it charges against <lb/>
her, and remember who it is it is speaking of. It <lb/>
calls her a sorceress, a false prophet, an invoker and <lb/>
companion of evil spirits, a dealer in magic, a person <lb/>
ignorant of the Catholic faith, a schismatic; she is <lb/>
sacrilegious, an idolater, an apostate, a blasphemer <lb/>
of God and his saints, scandalous, seditious, a dis- <lb/>
turber of the peace; she incites men to war, and to <lb/>
the spilling of human blood; she discards the decen- <lb/>
cies and proprieties of her sex, irreverently assuming <lb/>
the dress of a man and the vocation of a soldier; <lb/>
she beguiles both princes and people; she usurps <lb/>
divine honors, and has caused herself to be adored <lb/>
and venerated, offering her hands and her vestments <lb/>
to be kissed.</p>
<p>There it is&#x2014;every fact of her life distorted, per- <lb/>
verted, reversed. As a child she had loved the <lb/>
fairies, she had spoken a pitying word for them <lb/>
when they were banished from their home, she had <lb/>
played under their tree and around their fountain&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
hence she was a comrade of evil spirits. She had <lb/>
lifted France out of the mud and moved her to strike <lb/>
for freedom, and led her to victory after victory&#x2014; <lb/>
hence she was a disturber of the peace&#x2014;as indeed <lb/>
she was, and a provoker of war&#x2014;as indeed she <lb/>
was again! and France will be proud of it and <lb/>
grateful for it for many a century to come. And <lb/>
she had been adored&#x2014;as if she could help that, <lb/>
poor thing, or was in any way to blame for it. The <lb/>
cowed veteran and the wavering recruit had drunk <lb/>
the spirit of war from her eyes and touched her <lb/>
sword with theirs and moved forward invincible&#x2014; <lb/>
hence she was a sorceress.</p>
<p>And so the document went on, detail by detail, <lb/>
turning these waters of life to poison, this gold to <lb/>
dross, these proofs of a noble and beautiful life to <lb/>
evidences of a foul and odious one.</p>
<p>Of course, the sixty-six articles were just a rehash <lb/>
of the things which had come up in the course of <lb/>
the previous trials, so I will touch upon this new <lb/>
trial but lightly. In fact, Joan went but little into <lb/>
detail herself, usually merely saying "That is not <lb/>
true&#x2014; <foreign lang="fre"><i>passez outre;</i></foreign>" or, "I have answered that <lb/>
before&#x2014;let the clerk read it in his record," or say- <lb/>
ing some other brief thing.</p>
<p>She refused to have her mission examined and <lb/>
tried by the earthly Church. The refusal was taken <lb/>
note of.</p>
<p>She denied the accusation of idolatry and that <lb/>
she had sought men's homage. She said:</p>
<pb n="225"/>
<p>"If any kissed my hands and my vestments it <lb/>
was not by my desire, and I did what I could to <lb/>
prevent it."</p>
<p>She had the pluck to say to that deadly tribunal <lb/>
that she did not know the fairies to be evil beings. <lb/>
She knew it was a perilous thing to say, but it <lb/>
was not in her nature to speak anything but the <lb/>
truth when she spoke at all. Danger had no weight <lb/>
with her in such things. Note was taken of her <lb/>
remark.</p>
<p>She refused, as always before, when asked if she <lb/>
would put off the male attire if she were given per- <lb/>
mission to commune. And she added this:</p>
<p>"When one receives the sacrament, the manner <lb/>
of his dress is a small thing and of no value in the <lb/>
eyes of Our Lord."</p>
<p>She was charged with being so stubborn in cling- <lb/>
ing to her male dress that she would not lay it off <lb/>
even to get the blessed privilege of hearing mass. <lb/>
She spoke out with spirit and said:</p>
<p>"I would rather die than be untrue to my oath to <lb/>
God."</p>
<p>She was reproached with doing man's work in the <lb/>
wars and thus deserting the industries proper to her <lb/>
sex. She answered, with some little touch of <lb/>
soldierly disdain:</p>
<p>"As to the matter of women's work, there's <lb/>
plenty to do it."</p>
<p>It was always a comfort to me to see the soldier- <lb/>
spirit crop up in her. While that remained in her <lb/>
<pb n="226"/>
she would be Joan of Arc, and able to look trouble <lb/>
and fate in the face.</p>
<p>"It appears that this mission of yours which you <lb/>
claim you had from God, was to make war and pour <lb/>
out human blood."</p>
<p>Joan replied quite simply, contenting herself with <lb/>
explaining that war was not her first move, but her <lb/>
second:</p>
<p>"To begin with, I demanded that peace should <lb/>
be made. If it was refused, then I would fight."</p>
<p>The judge mixed the Burgundians and English <lb/>
together in speaking of the enemy which Joan had <lb/>
come to make war upon. But she showed that she <lb/>
made a distinction between them by act and word, <lb/>
the Burgundians being Frenchmen and therefore <lb/>
entitled to less brusque treatment than the English. <lb/>
She said:</p>
<p>"As to the Duke of Burgundy, I required of him, <lb/>
both by letters and by his ambassadors, that he <lb/>
make peace with the King. As to the English, the <lb/>
only peace for them was that they leave the country <lb/>
and go home."</p>
<p>Then she said that even with the English she had <lb/>
shown a pacific disposition, since she had warned <lb/>
them away by proclamation before attacking them.</p>
<p>"If they had listened to me," said she, "they <lb/>
would have done wisely." At this point she uttered <lb/>
her prophecy again, saying with emphasis, "Before <lb/>
seven years they will see it themselves."</p>
<p>Then they presently began to pester her again <lb/>
<pb n="227"/>
about her male costume, and tried to persuade her <lb/>
to voluntarily promise to discard it. I was never <lb/>
deep, so I think it no wonder that I was puzzled by <lb/>
their persistency in what seemed a thing of no con- <lb/>
sequence, and could not make out what their reason <lb/>
could be. But we all know now. We all know <lb/>
now that it was another of their treacherous pro- <lb/>
jects. Yes, if they could but succeed in getting her <lb/>
to formally discard it they could play a game upon <lb/>
her which would quickly destroy her. So they kept <lb/>
at their evil work until at last she broke out and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Peace! Without the permission of God I will <lb/>
not lay it off though you cut off my head!"</p>
<p>At one point she corrected the <foreign lang="dut"><i>proces verbal</i></foreign>, say- <lb/>
ing:</p>
<p>"It makes me say that everything which I have <lb/>
done was done by the counsel of Our Lord. I did <lb/>
not say that. I said 'all which I have <i>well</i> done.'"</p>
<p>Doubt was cast upon the authenticity of her <lb/>
mission because of the ignorance and simplicity of <lb/>
the messenger chosen. Joan smiled at that. She <lb/>
could have reminded these people that Our Lord, <lb/>
who is no respecter of persons, had chosen the <lb/>
lowly for his high purposes even oftener than he had <lb/>
chosen bishops and cardinals; but she phrased her <lb/>
rebuke in simpler terms:</p>
<p>"It is the prerogative of Our Lord to choose His <lb/>
instruments where He will."</p>
<p>She was asked what form of prayer she used in <lb/>
<pb n="228"/>
invoking counsel from on high. She said the form <lb/>
was brief and simple; then she lifted her pallid face <lb/>
and repeated it, clasping her chained hands:</p>
<p>"Most dear God, in honor of your holy passion I <lb/>
beseech you, if you love me, that you will reveal to <lb/>
me what I am to answer to these churchmen. As <lb/>
concerns my dress, I know by what command I have <lb/>
put it on, but I know not in what manner I am to <lb/>
lay it off. I pray you tell me what to do."</p>
<p>She was charged with having dared, against the <lb/>
precepts of God and His saints, to assume empire <lb/>
over men and make herself Commander-in-Chief. <lb/>
That touched the soldier in her. She had a deep <lb/>
reverence for priests, but the soldier in her had but <lb/>
small reverence for a priest's opinions about war; <lb/>
so, in her answer to this charge she did not conde- <lb/>
scend to go into any explanations or excuses, but <lb/>
delivered herself with bland indifference and military <lb/>
brevity.</p>
<p>"If I was Commander-in-Chief, it was to thrash <lb/>
the English!"</p>
<p>Death was staring her in the face here all the <lb/>
time, but no matter; she dearly loved to make these <lb/>
English-hearted Frenchmen squirm, and whenever <lb/>
they gave her an opening she was prompt to jab her <lb/>
sting into it. She got great refreshment out of <lb/>
these little episodes. Her days were a desert; these <lb/>
were the oases in it.</p>
<p>Her being in the wars with men was charged <lb/>
against her as an indelicacy. She said:</p>
<pb n="229"/>
<p>"I had a woman with me when I could&#x2014;in <lb/>
towns and lodgings. In the field I always slept in <lb/>
my armor."</p>
<p>That she and her family had been ennobled by <lb/>
the King was charged against her as evidence that <lb/>
the source of her deeds were sordid self-seeking. <lb/>
She answered that she had not asked this grace of <lb/>
the King, it was his own act.</p>
<p>This third trial was ended at last. And once <lb/>
again there was no definite result.</p>
<p>Possibly a fourth trial might succeed in defeating <lb/>
this apparently unconquerable girl. So the malig- <lb/>
nant Bishop set himself to work to plan it.</p>
<p>He appointed a commission to reduce the sub- <lb/>
stance of the sixty six articles to twelve compact <lb/>
lies, as a basis for the new attempt. This was done. <lb/>
It took several days.</p>
<p>Meantime Cauchon went to Joan's cell one day, <lb/>
with Manchon and two of the judges, Isambard de <lb/>
la Pierre and Martin Ladvenue, to see if he could <lb/>
not manage somehow to beguile Joan into submit- <lb/>
ting her mission to the examination and decision of <lb/>
the church militant&#x2014;that is to say, to that part of <lb/>
the church militant which was represented by himself <lb/>
and his creatures.</p>
<p>Joan once more positively refused. Isambard de <lb/>
la Pierre had a heart in his body, and he so pitied <lb/>
this persecuted poor girl that he ventured to do a <lb/>
very daring thing; for he asked her if she would be <lb/>
willing to have her case go before the Council of <lb/>
<pb n="230"/>
Basel, and said it contained as many priests of her <lb/>
party as of the English party.</p>
<p>Joan cried out that she would gladly go before so <lb/>
fairly constructed a tribunal as that; but before <lb/>
Isambard could say another word Cauchon turned <lb/>
savagely upon him and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Shut up, in the devil's name!"</p>
<p>Then Manchon ventured to do a brave thing, too, <lb/>
though he did it in great fear for his life. He asked <lb/>
Cauchon if he should enter Joan's submission to the <lb/>
Council of Basel upon the minutes.</p>
<p>"No! It is not necessary."</p>
<p>"Ah," said poor Joan, reproachfully, "you set <lb/>
down everything that is against me, but you will not <lb/>
set down what is for me."</p>
<p>It was piteous. It would have touched the heart <lb/>
of a brute. But Cauchon was more than that.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XIV">
<pb n="231"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XIV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> were now in the first days of April. Joan <lb/>
was ill. She had fallen ill the 29th of March, <lb/>
the day after the close of the third trial, and was <lb/>
growing worse when the scene which I have just de- <lb/>
scribed occurred in her cell. It was just like <lb/>
Cauchon to go there and try to get some advantage <lb/>
out of her weakened state.</p>
<p>Let us note some of the particulars in the new in- <lb/>
dictment&#x2014;the Twelve Lies.</p>
<p>Part of the first one says Joan asserts that she has <lb/>
found her salvation. She never said anything of the <lb/>
kind. It also says she refuses to submit herself to <lb/>
the Church. Not true. She was willing to submit <lb/>
all her acts to this Rouen tribunal except those done <lb/>
by command of God in fulfillment of her mission. <lb/>
Those she reserved for the judgment of God. She <lb/>
refused to recognize Cauchon and his serfs as the <lb/>
Church, but was willing to go before the Pope or <lb/>
the Council of Basel.</p>
<p>A clause of another of the Twelve says she admits <lb/>
having threatened with death those who would not <lb/>
obey her. Distinctly false. Another clause says <lb/>
<pb n="232"/>
she declares that all she has done has been done by <lb/>
command of God. What she really said was, all <lb/>
that she had done <i>well</i>&#x2014;a correction made by her- <lb/>
self as you have already seen.</p>
<p>Another of the Twelve says she claims that she <lb/>
has never committed any sin. She never made any <lb/>
such claim.</p>
<p>Another makes the wearing of the male dress a <lb/>
sin. If it was, she had high Catholic authority for <lb/>
committing it&#x2014;that of the Archbishop of Rheims <lb/>
and the tribunal of Poitiers.</p>
<p>The Tenth Article was resentful against her for <lb/>
"pretending" that St. Catherine and St. Marguerite <lb/>
spoke French and not English, and were French in <lb/>
their politics.</p>
<p>The Twelve were to be submitted first to the <lb/>
learned doctors of theology of the University of <lb/>
Paris for approval. They were copied out and <lb/>
ready by the night of April 4th. Then Manchon <lb/>
did another bold thing: he wrote in the margin that <lb/>
many of the Twelve put statements in Joan's mouth <lb/>
which were the exact opposite of what she had said. <lb/>
<i>That</i> fact would not be considered important by <lb/>
the University of Paris, and would not influence its <lb/>
decision or stir its humanity, in case it had any&#x2014; <lb/>
which it hadn't when acting in a political capacity, <lb/>
as at present&#x2014;but it was a brave thing for that <lb/>
good Manchon to do, all the same.</p>
<p>The Twelve were sent to Paris next day, April <lb/>
5th. That afternoon there was a great tumult in <lb/>
<pb n="233"/>
Rouen, and excited crowds were flocking through all <lb/>
the chief streets, chattering and seeking for news; <lb/>
for a report had gone abroad that Joan of Arc was <lb/>
sick unto death. In truth, these long seances had <lb/>
worn her out, and she was ill indeed. The heads of <lb/>
the English party were in a state of consternation; <lb/>
for if Joan should die uncondemned by the Church <lb/>
and go to the grave unsmirched, the pity and the <lb/>
love of the people would turn her wrongs and suffer- <lb/>
ings and death into a holy martyrdom, and she would <lb/>
be even a mightier power in France dead than she <lb/>
had been when alive.</p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick and the English Cardinal <lb/>
(Winchester) hurried to the castle and sent mes- <lb/>
sengers flying for physicians. Warwick was a hard <lb/>
man, a rude, coarse man, a man without compassion. <lb/>
There lay the sick girl stretched in her chains in her <lb/>
iron cage&#x2014;not an object to move man to ungentle <lb/>
speech, one would think; yet Warwick spoke right <lb/>
out in her hearing and said to the physicians:</p>
<p>"Mind you take good care of her. The King of <lb/>
England has no mind to have her die a natural <lb/>
death. She is dear to him, for he bought her dear, <lb/>
and he does not want her to die, save at the stake. <lb/>
Now then, mind you cure her."</p>
<p>The doctors asked Joan what had made her ill. <lb/>
She said the Bishop of Beauvais had sent her a fish <lb/>
and she thought it was that.</p>
<p>Then Jean d'Estivet burst out on her, and called <lb/>
her names and abused her. He understood Joan to <lb/>
<pb n="234"/>
be charging the Bishop with poisoning her, you see; <lb/>
and that was not pleasing to him, for he was one of <lb/>
Cauchon's most loving and conscienceless slaves, <lb/>
and it outraged him to have Joan injure his master <lb/>
in the eyes of these great English chiefs, these being <lb/>
men who could ruin Cauchon and would promptly <lb/>
do it if they got the conviction that he was capable <lb/>
of saving Joan from the stake by poisoning her and <lb/>
thus cheating the English out of all the real value <lb/>
gainable by her purchase from the Duke of Bur- <lb/>
gundy.</p>
<p>Joan had a high fever, and the doctors proposed <lb/>
to bleed her. Warwick said:</p>
<p>"Be careful about that; she is smart and is <lb/>
capable of killing herself."</p>
<p>He meant that to escape the stake she might undo <lb/>
the bandage and let herself bleed to death.</p>
<p>But the doctors bled her anyway, and then she <lb/>
was better.</p>
<p>Not for long, though. Jean d'Estivet could not <lb/>
hold still, he was so worried and angry about the <lb/>
suspicion of poisoning which Joan had hinted at; so <lb/>
he came back in the evening and stormed at her till <lb/>
he brought the fever all back again.</p>
<p>When Warwick heard of this he was in a fine <lb/>
temper, you may be sure, for here was his prey <lb/>
threatening to escape again, and all through the <lb/>
over-zeal of this meddling fool. Warwick gave <lb/>
D'Estivet a quite admirable cursing&#x2014;admirable as <lb/>
to strength, I mean, for it was said by persons of <lb/>
<pb n="235"/>
culture that the art of it was not good&#x2014;and after <lb/>
that the meddler kept still.</p>
<p>Joan remained ill more than two weeks; then she <lb/>
grew better. She was still very weak, but she could <lb/>
bear a little persecution now without much danger to <lb/>
her life. It seemed to Cauchon a good time to <lb/>
furnish it. So he called together some of his doc- <lb/>
tors of theology and went to her dungeon. Man- <lb/>
chon and I went along to keep the record&#x2014;that is, <lb/>
to set down what might be useful to Cauchon, and <lb/>
leave out the rest.</p>
<p>The sight of Joan gave me a shock. Why, she <lb/>
was but a shadow! It was difficult for me to realize <lb/>
that this frail little creature with the sad face and <lb/>
drooping form was the same Joan of Arc that I had <lb/>
so often seen, all fire and enthusiasm, charging <lb/>
through a hail of death and the lightning and thunder <lb/>
of the guns at the head of her battalions. It wrung <lb/>
my heart to see her looking like this.</p>
<p>But Cauchon was not touched. He made another <lb/>
of those conscienceless speeches of his, all dripping <lb/>
with hypocrisy and guile. He told Joan that among <lb/>
her answers had been some which had seemed to en- <lb/>
danger religion; and as she was ignorant and with- <lb/>
out knowledge of the Scriptures, he had brought <lb/>
some good and wise men to instruct her, if she de- <lb/>
sired it. Said he, "We are churchmen, and dis- <lb/>
posed by our good will as well as by our vocation to <lb/>
procure for you the salvation of your soul and your <lb/>
body, in every way in our power, just as we would <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
do the like for our nearest kin or for ourselves. In <lb/>
this we but follow the example of Holy Church, <lb/>
who never closes the refuge of her bosom against <lb/>
any that are willing to return."</p>
<p>Joan thanked him for these sayings and said:</p>
<p>"I seem to be in danger of death from this malady; <lb/>
if it be the pleasure of God that I die here, I beg <lb/>
that I may be heard in confession and also receive <lb/>
my Saviour; and that I may be buried in conse- <lb/>
crated ground."</p>
<p>Cauchon thought he saw his opportunity at last; <lb/>
this weakened body had the fear of an unblessed <lb/>
death before it and the pains of hell to follow. This <lb/>
stubborn spirit would surrender now. So he spoke <lb/>
out and said:</p>
<p>"Then if you want the Sacraments, you must do <lb/>
as all good Catholics do, and submit to the Church."</p>
<p>He was eager for her answer; but when it came <lb/>
there was no surrender in it, she still stood to her <lb/>
guns. She turned her head away and said wearily:</p>
<p>"I have nothing more to say."</p>
<p>Cauchon's temper was stirred, and he raised his <lb/>
voice threateningly and said that the more she was <lb/>
in danger of death the more she ought to amend her <lb/>
life; and again he refused the things she begged for <lb/>
unless she would submit to the Church. Joan said:</p>
<p>"If I die in this prison I beg you to have me <lb/>
buried in holy ground; if you will not, I cast myself <lb/>
upon my Saviour."</p>
<p>There was some more conversation of the like sort, <lb/>
<pb n="237"/>
then Cauchon demanded again, and imperiously, <lb/>
that she submit herself and all her deeds to the <lb/>
Church. His threatening and storming went for <lb/>
nothing. That body was weak, but the spirit in it <lb/>
was the spirit of Joan of Arc; and out of that came <lb/>
the steadfast answer which these people were already <lb/>
so familiar with and detested so sincerely:</p>
<p>"Let come what may, I will neither do nor say <lb/>
any otherwise than I have said already in your <lb/>
tribunals."</p>
<p>Then the good theologians took turn about and <lb/>
worried her with reasonings and arguments and <lb/>
Scriptures; and always they held the lure of the <lb/>
Sacraments before her famishing soul, and tried <lb/>
to bribe her with them to surrender her mission <lb/>
to the Church's judgment&#x2014;that is to <i>their</i> judg- <lb/>
ment&#x2014;as if <i>they</i> were the Church! But it availed <lb/>
nothing. I could have told them that beforehand, <lb/>
if they had asked me. But they never asked me <lb/>
anything; I was too humble a creature for their <lb/>
notice.</p>
<p>Then the interview closed with a threat; a threat <lb/>
of fearful import; a threat calculated to make a <lb/>
Catholic Christian feel as if the ground were sinking <lb/>
from under him:</p>
<p>"The Church calls upon you to submit; disobey, <lb/>
and she will abandon you as if you were a pagan!"</p>
<p>Think of being abandoned by the Church!&#x2014;that <lb/>
august Power in whose hands is lodged the fate of <lb/>
the human race; whose scepter stretches beyond <lb/>
<pb n="238"/>
the furthest constellation that twinkles in the sky; <lb/>
whose authority is over the millions that live and <lb/>
over the billions that wait trembling in purgatory for <lb/>
ransom or doom; whose smile opens the gates of <lb/>
Heaven to you, whose frown delivers you to the <lb/>
fires of everlasting hell; a Power whose dominion <lb/>
overshadows and belittles earthly empire as earthly <lb/>
empire overshadows and belittles the pomps and <lb/>
shows of a village. To be abandoned by one's <lb/>
King&#x2014;yes, that is death, and death is much; but <lb/>
to be abandoned by Rome, to be abandoned by the <lb/>
Church! Ah, death is nothing to that, for that is <lb/>
consignment to endless <i>life</i>&#x2014;and such a life!</p>
<p>I could see the red waves tossing in that shoreless <lb/>
lake of fire, I could see the black myriads of the <lb/>
damned rise out of them and struggle and sink and <lb/>
rise again; and I knew that Joan was seeing what I <lb/>
saw, while she paused musing; and I believed that <lb/>
she must yield now, and in truth I hoped she would, <lb/>
for these men were able to make the threat <lb/>
good and deliver her over to eternal suffering, and I <lb/>
knew that it was in their natures to do it.</p>
<p>But I was foolish to think that thought and hope <lb/>
that hope. Joan of Arc was not made as others are <lb/>
made. Fidelity to principle, fidelity to truth, fidelity <lb/>
to her word, all these were in her bone and in her <lb/>
flesh&#x2014;they were parts of her. She could not <lb/>
change, she could not cast them out. She was the <lb/>
very genius of Fidelity, she was Steadfastness incar- <lb/>
nated. Where she had taken her stand and planted <lb/>
<pb n="239"/>
her foot, there she would abide; hell itself could <lb/>
not move her from that place.</p>
<p>Her Voices had not given her permission to make <lb/>
the sort of submission that was required, therefore <lb/>
she would stand fast. She would wait, in perfect <lb/>
obedience, let come what might.</p>
<p>My heart was like lead in my body when I went <lb/>
out from that dungeon; but she&#x2014;she was serene, <lb/>
she was not troubled. She had done what she be- <lb/>
lieved to be her duty, and that was sufficient; the <lb/>
consequences were not her affair. The last thing <lb/>
she said that time was full of this serenity, full of <lb/>
contented repose:</p>
<p>"I am a good Christian born and baptized, and a <lb/>
good Christian I will die."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Two</smcap> weeks went by; the second of May was <lb/>
come, the chill was departed out of the air, <lb/>
the wild flowers were springing in the glades and <lb/>
glens, the birds were piping in the woods, all nature <lb/>
was brilliant with sunshine, all spirits were renewed <lb/>
and refreshed, all hearts glad, the world was alive <lb/>
with hope and cheer, the plain beyond the Seine <lb/>
stretched away soft and rich and green, the river was <lb/>
limpid and lovely, the leafy islands were dainty to <lb/>
see, and flung still daintier reflections of themselves <lb/>
upon the shining water; and from the tall bluffs <lb/>
above the bridge Rouen was become again a delight <lb/>
to the eye, the most exquisite and satisfying picture <lb/>
of a town that nestles under the arch of heaven any- <lb/>
where.</p>
<p>When I say that all hearts were glad and hopeful, <lb/>
I mean it in a general sense. There were exceptions <lb/>
&#x2014;we who were the friends of Joan of Arc, also <lb/>
Joan of Arc herself, that poor girl shut up there in <lb/>
that frowning stretch of mighty walls and towers: <lb/>
brooding in darkness, so close to the flooding down- <lb/>
pour of sunshine yet so impossibly far away from it; <lb/>
<pb n="241"/>
so longing for any little glimpse of it, yet so im- <lb/>
placably denied it by those wolves in the black <lb/>
gowns who were plotting her death and the blacken- <lb/>
ing of her good name.</p>
<p>Cauchon was ready to go on with his miserable <lb/>
work. He had a new scheme to try now. He <lb/>
would see what persuasion could do&#x2014;argument, <lb/>
eloquence, poured out upon the incorrigible cap- <lb/>
tive from the mouth of a trained expert. That was <lb/>
his plan. But the reading of the Twelve Articles <lb/>
to her was not a part of it. No, even Cauchon <lb/>
was ashamed to lay that monstrosity before her; <lb/>
even he had a remnant of shame in him, away down <lb/>
deep, a million fathoms deep, and that remnant <lb/>
asserted itself now and prevailed.</p>
<p>On this fair second of May, then, the black com- <lb/>
pany gathered itself together in the spacious chamber <lb/>
at the end of the great hall of the castle&#x2014;the Bishop <lb/>
of Beauvais on his throne, and sixty-two minor <lb/>
judges massed before him, with the guards and <lb/>
recorders at their stations and the orator at his desk.</p>
<p>Then we heard the far clank of chains, and pres- <lb/>
ently Joan entered with her keepers and took her <lb/>
seat upon her isolated bench. She was looking well <lb/>
now, and most fair and beautiful after her fortnight's <lb/>
rest from wordy persecution.</p>
<p>She glanced about and noted the orator. Doubt- <lb/>
less she divined the situation.</p>
<p>The orator had written his speech all out, and had <lb/>
it in his hand, though he held it back of him out of <lb/>
<pb n="242"/>
sight. It was so thick that it resembled a book. <lb/>
He began flowingly, but in the midst of a flowery <lb/>
period his memory failed him and he had to snatch <lb/>
a furtive glance at his manuscript&#x2014;which much in- <lb/>
jured the effect. Again this happened, and then a <lb/>
third time. The poor man's face was red with em- <lb/>
barrassment, the whole great house was pitying <lb/>
him, which made the matter worse; then Joan <lb/>
dropped in a remark which completed his trouble. <lb/>
She said:</p>
<p>"<i>Read your book</i>&#x2014;and then I will answer you!"</p>
<p>Why, it was almost cruel the way those mouldy <lb/>
veterans laughed; and as for the orator, he looked <lb/>
so flustered and helpless that almost anybody would <lb/>
have pitied him, and I had difficulty to keep from <lb/>
doing it myself. Yes, Joan was feeling very well <lb/>
after her rest, and the native mischief that was in <lb/>
her lay near the surface. It did not show when she <lb/>
made the remark, but I knew it was close in there <lb/>
back of the words.</p>
<p>When the orator had gotten back his composure <lb/>
he did a wise thing; for he followed Joan's advice: <lb/>
he made no more attempts at sham impromptu <lb/>
oratory, but read his speech straight from his <lb/>
"book." In the speech he compressed the Twelve <lb/>
Articles into six and made these his text.</p>
<p>Every now and then he stopped and asked ques- <lb/>
tions, and Joan replied. The nature of the church <lb/>
militant was explained, and once more Joan was <lb/>
asked to submit herself to it.</p>
<pb n="243"/>
<p>She gave her usual answer.</p>
<p>Then she was asked:</p>
<p>"Do you believe the Church can err?"</p>
<p>"I believe it cannot err; but for those deeds and <lb/>
words of mine which were done and uttered by com- <lb/>
mand of God, I will answer to Him alone."</p>
<p>"Will you say that you have no judge upon <lb/>
earth? Is not our Holy Father the Pope your <lb/>
judge?"</p>
<p>"I will say nothing to you about it. I have a <lb/>
good Master who is our Lord and to Him I will <lb/>
submit all."</p>
<p>Then came these terrible words:</p>
<p>"If you do not submit to the Church you will be <lb/>
pronounced a heretic by these judges here present <lb/>
and burned at the stake!"</p>
<p>Ah, that would have smitten you or me dead with <lb/>
fright, but it only roused the lion heart of Joan of <lb/>
Arc, and in her answer rang that martial note which <lb/>
had used to stir her soldiers like a bugle-call:</p>
<p>"I will not say otherwise than I have said al- <lb/>
ready; and if I saw the fire before me I would say <lb/>
it again!"</p>
<p>It was uplifting to hear her battle-voice once more <lb/>
and see the battle-light burn in her eye. Many <lb/>
there were stirred; every man that was a <i>man</i> was <lb/>
stirred, whether friend or foe; and Manchon risked <lb/>
his life again, good soul, for he wrote in the margin <lb/>
of the record in good plain letters these brave <lb/>
words: "<foreign lang="spa"><i>Superba responsio!</i></foreign>" and there they have <lb/>
<pb n="244"/>
remained these sixty years, and there you may read <lb/>
them to this day.</p>
<p>"<foreign lang="spa"><i>Superba responsio!</i></foreign>" Yes, it was just that. <lb/>
For this "superb answer" came from the lips of a <lb/>
girl of nineteen with death and hell staring her in <lb/>
the face.</p>
<p>Of course, the matter of the male attire was gone <lb/>
over again; and as usual at wearisome length; also, <lb/>
as usual, the customary bribe was offered: if she <lb/>
would discard that dress voluntarily they would let <lb/>
her hear mass. But she answered as she had often <lb/>
answered before:</p>
<p>"I will go in a woman's robe to all services of <lb/>
the church if I may be permitted, but I will resume <lb/>
the other dress when I return to my cell."</p>
<p>They set several traps for her in a tentative form; <lb/>
that is to say, they placed supposititious propositions <lb/>
before her and cunningly tried to commit her to one <lb/>
end of the propositions without committing them- <lb/>
selves to the other. But she always saw the game <lb/>
and spoiled it. The trap was in this form:</p>
<p>"Would you be willing to do so and so if we <lb/>
should give you leave?"</p>
<p>Her answer was always in this form or to this <lb/>
effect:</p>
<p>"When you give me leave, then you will know."</p>
<p>Yes, Joan was at her best that second of May. <lb/>
She had all her wits about her, and they could not <lb/>
catch her anywhere. It was a long, long session, <lb/>
and all the old ground was fought over again, foot <lb/>
<pb n="245"/>
by foot, and the orator-expert worked all his per- <lb/>
suasions, all his eloquence; but the result was the <lb/>
familiar one&#x2014;a drawn battle, the sixty-two retiring <lb/>
upon their base, the solitary enemy holding her <lb/>
original position within her original lines.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XVI">
<pb n="246"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XVI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> brilliant weather, the heavenly weather, the <lb/>
bewitching weather made everybody's heart to <lb/>
sing, as I have told you; yes, Rouen was feeling <lb/>
light-hearted and gay, and most willing and ready <lb/>
to break out and laugh upon the least occasion; and <lb/>
so when the news went around that the young girl in <lb/>
the tower had scored another defeat against Bishop <lb/>
Cauchon there was abundant laughter&#x2014;abundant <lb/>
laughter among the citizens of both parties, for they <lb/>
all hated the Bishop. It is true, the English- <lb/>
hearted majority of the people wanted Joan burned, <lb/>
but that did not keep them from laughing at the <lb/>
man they hated. It would have been perilous for <lb/>
anybody to laugh at the English chiefs or at the <lb/>
majority of Cauchon's assistant judges, but to laugh <lb/>
at Cauchon or D'Estivet and Loyseleur was safe&#x2014; <lb/>
nobody would report it.</p>
<p>The difference between Cauchon and <foreign lang="fre"><i>cochon</i></foreign><ref target="n6">*</ref><note id="n6" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Hog, pig.</p></note> was <lb/>
not noticeable in speech, and so there was plenty of <lb/>
opportunity for puns; the opportunities were not <lb/>
thrown away.</p>
<pb n="247"/>
<p>Some of the jokes got well worn in the course of <lb/>
two or three months, from repeated use; for every <lb/>
time Cauchon started a new trial the folk said "The <lb/>
sow has littered<ref target="n7">*</ref><note id="n7" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p><foreign lang="fre"><i>Cochonner</i></foreign>, to litter, to farrow; also, "to make a mess of!"</p></note> again"; and every time the trial <lb/>
failed they said it over again, with its other mean- <lb/>
ing, "The hog has made a mess of it."</p>
<p>And so, on the third of May, No&#x00EB;l and I, drifting <lb/>
about the town, heard many a wide-mouthed lout <lb/>
let go his joke and his laugh, and then move to the <lb/>
next group, proud of his wit and happy, to work it <lb/>
off again:</p>
<p>"'Ods blood, the sow has littered five times, and <lb/>
five times has made a mess of it!"</p>
<p>And now and then one was bold enough to say&#x2014; <lb/>
but he said it softly:</p>
<p>"Sixty-three and the might of England against a <lb/>
girl, and she camps on the field five times!"</p>
<p>Cauchon lived in the great palace of the Arch- <lb/>
bishop, and it was guarded by English soldiery; <lb/>
but no matter, there was never a dark night but the <lb/>
walls showed next morning that the rude joker had <lb/>
been there with his paint and brush. Yes, he had <lb/>
been there, and had smeared the sacred walls with <lb/>
pictures of hogs in all attitudes except flattering <lb/>
ones; hogs clothed in a Bishop's vestments and <lb/>
wearing a Bishop's mitre irreverently cocked on the <lb/>
side of their heads.</p>
<p>Cauchon raged and cursed over his defeats and his <lb/>
impotence during seven days, then he conceived a <lb/>
<pb n="248"/>
new scheme. You shall see what it was; for you <lb/>
have not cruel hearts, and you would never guess it.</p>
<p>On the ninth of May there was a summons, and <lb/>
Manchon and I got our materials together and <lb/>
started. But this time we were to go to one of the <lb/>
other towers&#x2014;not the one which was Joan's prison. <lb/>
It was round and grim and massive, and built of the <lb/>
plainest and thickest and solidest masonry&#x2014;a dismal <lb/>
and forbidding structure.<ref target="n8">*</ref><note id="n8" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The lower half of it remains to-day just as it was then; the upper <lb/>
half is of a later date.&#x2014;<smcap>Translator</smcap>.</p></note></p>
<p>We entered the circular room on the ground floor, <lb/>
and I saw what turned me sick&#x2014;the instruments of <lb/>
torture and the executioners standing ready! Here <lb/>
you have the black heart of Cauchon at the blackest, <lb/>
here you have the proof that in his nature there was <lb/>
no such thing as pity. One wonders if he ever <lb/>
knew his mother or ever had a sister.</p>
<p>Cauchon was there, and the Vice-Inquisitor and <lb/>
the Abbot of St. Corneille; also six others, among <lb/>
them that false Loyseleur. The guards were in their <lb/>
places, the rack was there, and by it stood the exe- <lb/>
cutioner and his aids in their crimson hose and <lb/>
doublets, meet color for their bloody trade. The <lb/>
picture of Joan rose before me stretched upon the <lb/>
rack, her feet tied to one end of it, her wrists to the <lb/>
other, and those red giants turning the windlass and <lb/>
pulling her limbs out of their sockets. It seemed to <lb/>
me that I could hear the bones snap and the flesh <lb/>
tear apart, and I did not see how that body of <lb/>
<pb n="249"/>
anointed servants of the merciful Jesus could sit <lb/>
there and look so placid and indifferent.</p>
<p>After a little, Joan arrived and was brought in. <lb/>
She saw the rack, she saw the attendants, and the <lb/>
same picture which I had been seeing must have <lb/>
risen in her mind; but do you think she quailed, <lb/>
do you think she shuddered? No, there was no <lb/>
sign of that sort. She straightened herself up, and <lb/>
there was a slight curl of scorn about her lip; but <lb/>
as for fear, she showed not a vestige of it.</p>
<p>This was a memorable session, but it was the <lb/>
shortest one of all the list. When Joan had taken <lb/>
her seat a r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of her "crimes" was read to <lb/>
her. Then Cauchon made a solemn speech. In <lb/>
it he said that in the course of her several trials <lb/>
Joan had refused to answer some of the questions <lb/>
and had answered others with lies, but that now he <lb/>
was going to have the truth out of her, and the <lb/>
whole of it.</p>
<p>His manner was full of confidence this time; he <lb/>
was sure he had found a way at last to break this <lb/>
child's stubborn spirit and make her beg and cry. <lb/>
He would score a victory this time and stop the <lb/>
mouths of the jokers of Rouen. You see, he was <lb/>
only just a man after all, and couldn't stand ridicule <lb/>
any better than other people. He talked high, and <lb/>
his splotchy face lighted itself up with all the shift- <lb/>
ing tints and signs of evil pleasure and promised <lb/>
triumph&#x2014;purple, yellow, red, green&#x2014;they were <lb/>
all there, with sometimes the dull and spongy blue <lb/>
<pb n="250"/>
of a drowned man, the uncanniest of them all. And <lb/>
finally he burst out in a great passion and said:</p>
<p>"There is the rack, and there are its ministers! <lb/>
You will reveal all now or be put to the torture. <lb/>
Speak."</p>
<p>Then she made that great answer which will live <lb/>
forever; made it without fuss or bravado, and yet <lb/>
how fine and noble was the sound of it:</p>
<p>"I will tell you nothing more than I have told <lb/>
you; no, not even if you tear the limbs from my <lb/>
body. And even if in my pain I <i>did</i> say something <lb/>
other wise, I would always say afterwards that it <lb/>
was the torture that spoke and not I."</p>
<p>There was no crushing that spirit. You should <lb/>
have seen Cauchon. Defeated again, and he had <lb/>
not dreamed of such a thing. I heard it said next <lb/>
day, around the town, that he had a full confession, <lb/>
all written out, in his pocket and all ready for Joan <lb/>
to sign. I do not know that that was true, but it <lb/>
probably was, for her mark signed at the bottom of <lb/>
a confession would be the kind of evidence (for <lb/>
effect with the public) which Cauchon and his <lb/>
people would particularly value, you know.</p>
<p>No, there was no crushing that spirit, and no <lb/>
beclouding that clear mind. Consider the depth, the <lb/>
wisdom of that answer, coming from an ignorant <lb/>
girl. Why, there were not six men in the world <lb/>
who had ever reflected that words forced out of a <lb/>
person by horrible tortures were not necessarily <lb/>
words of verity and truth, yet this unlettered <lb/>
<pb n="251"/>
peasant girl put her finger upon that flaw with an <lb/>
unerring instinct. I had always supposed that tor- <lb/>
ture brought out the truth&#x2014;everybody supposed <lb/>
it; and when Joan came out with those simple <lb/>
common-sense words they seemed to flood the place <lb/>
with light. It was like a lightning-flash at midnight <lb/>
which suddenly reveals a fair valley sprinkled over <lb/>
with silver streams and gleaming villages and farm- <lb/>
steads where was only an impenetrable world of dark- <lb/>
ness before. Manchon stole a sidewise look at me, <lb/>
and his face was full of surprise; and there was the <lb/>
like to be seen in other faces there. Consider&#x2014;they <lb/>
were old, and deeply cultured, yet here was a village <lb/>
maid able to teach them something which they had <lb/>
not known before. I heard one of them mutter:</p>
<p>"Verily it is a wonderful creature. She has laid <lb/>
her hand upon an accepted truth that is as old as the <lb/>
world, and it has crumbled to dust and rubbish under <lb/>
her touch. Now whence got she that marvelous <lb/>
insight?"</p>
<p>The judges laid their heads together and began to <lb/>
talk low. It was plain, from chance words which <lb/>
one caught now and then, that Cauchon and Loyse- <lb/>
leur were insisting upon the application of the tor- <lb/>
ture, and that most of the others were urgently <lb/>
objecting.</p>
<p>Finally Cauchon broke out with a good deal of <lb/>
asperity in his voice and ordered Joan back to her <lb/>
dungeon. That was a happy surprise for me. I <lb/>
was not expecting that the Bishop would yield.</p>
<pb n="252"/>
<p>When Manchon came home that night he said he <lb/>
had found out why the torture was not applied. <lb/>
There were two reasons. One was, a fear that Joan <lb/>
might die under the torture, which would not suit <lb/>
the English at all; the other was, that the torture <lb/>
would effect nothing if Joan was going to take back <lb/>
everything she said under its pains; and as to put- <lb/>
ting her mark to a confession, it was believed that <lb/>
not even the rack could ever make her do that.</p>
<p>So all Rouen laughed again, and kept it up for <lb/>
three days, saying:</p>
<p>"The sow has littered six times, and made six <lb/>
messes of it."</p>
<p>And the palace walls got a new decoration&#x2014;a <lb/>
mitred hog carrying a discarded rack home on its <lb/>
shoulder, and Loyseleur weeping in its wake. Many <lb/>
rewards were offered for the capture of these <lb/>
painters, but nobody applied. Even the English <lb/>
guard feigned blindness and would not see the artists <lb/>
at work.</p>
<p>The Bishop's anger was very high now. He could <lb/>
not reconcile himself to the idea of giving up the <lb/>
torture. It was the pleasantest idea he had invented <lb/>
yet, and he would not cast it by. So he called in <lb/>
some of his satellites on the twelfth, and urged the <lb/>
torture again. But it was a failure. With some, <lb/>
Joan's speech had wrought an effect; others feared <lb/>
she might die under the torture; others did not be- <lb/>
lieve that any amount of suffering could make her <lb/>
put her mark to a lying confession. There were <lb/>
<pb n="253"/>
fourteen men present, including the Bishop. Eleven <lb/>
of them voted dead against the torture, and stood <lb/>
their ground in spite of Cauchon's abuse. Two <lb/>
voted with the Bishop and insisted upon the torture. <lb/>
These two were Loyseleur and the orator&#x2014;the man <lb/>
whom Joan had bidden to "read his book"&#x2014; <lb/>

<head><b>CHAPTER XVII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Another</smcap> ten days' wait. The great theologians <lb/>
of that treasury of all valuable knowledge and <lb/>
all wisdom, the University of Paris, were still weigh- <lb/>
ing and considering and discussing the Twelve Lies.</p>
<p>I had but little to do these ten days, so I spent <lb/>
them mainly in walks about the town with No&#x00EB;l. <lb/>
But there was no pleasure in them, our spirits being <lb/>
so burdened with cares, and the outlook for Joan <lb/>
growing so steadily darker and darker all the time. <lb/>
And then we naturally contrasted our circumstances <lb/>
with hers: this freedom and sunshine, with her dark- <lb/>
ness and chains; our comradeship, with her lonely <lb/>
estate; our alleviations of one sort and another, with <lb/>
her destitution in all. She was used to liberty, but <lb/>
now she had none; she was an out-of-door creature <lb/>
by nature and habit, but now she was shut up day <lb/>
and night in a steel cage like an animal; she was <lb/>
used to the light, but now she was always in a <lb/>
gloom where all objects about her were dim and <lb/>
spectral; she was used to the thousand various <lb/>
sounds which are the cheer and music of a busy <lb/>
life, but now she heard only the monotonous foot- <lb/>
<pb n="255"/>
fall of the sentry pacing his watch; she had been <lb/>
fond of talking with her mates, but now there was <lb/>
no one to talk to; she had had an easy laugh, but it <lb/>
was gone dumb now; she had been born for com- <lb/>
radeship, and blithe and busy work, and all manner <lb/>
of joyous activities, but here were only dreariness, <lb/>
and leaden hours, and weary inaction, and brooding <lb/>
stillness, and thoughts that travel day and night and <lb/>
night and day round and round in the same circle, <lb/>
and wear the brain and break the heart with weari- <lb/>
ness. It was death in life; yes, death in life, that <lb/>
is what it must have been. And there was another <lb/>
hard thing about it all. A young girl in trouble <lb/>
needs the soothing solace and support and sym- <lb/>
pathy of persons of her own sex, and the delicate <lb/>
offices and gentle ministries which only these can <lb/>
furnish; yet in all these months of gloomy cap- <lb/>
tivity in her dungeon Joan never saw the face of <lb/>
a girl or a woman. Think how her heart would <lb/>
have leaped to see such a face.</p>
<p>Consider. If you would realize how great Joan <lb/>
of Arc was, remember that it was out of such a <lb/>
place and such circumstances that she came week <lb/>
after week and month after month and confronted <lb/>
the master intellects of France single-handed, and <lb/>
baffled their cunningest schemes, defeated their <lb/>
ablest plans, detected and avoided their secretest <lb/>
traps and pitfalls, broke their lines, repelled their <lb/>
assaults, and camped on the field after every en- <lb/>
gagement; steadfast always, true to her faith and <lb/>
<pb n="256"/>
her ideals; defying torture, defying the stake, and <lb/>
answering threats of eternal death and the pains of <lb/>
hell with a simple "Let come what may, here I take <lb/>
my stand and will abide."</p>
<p>Yes, if you would realize how great was the soul, <lb/>
how profound the wisdom, and how luminous the <lb/>
intellect of Joan of Arc, you must study her there, <lb/>
where she fought out that long fight all alone&#x2014;and <lb/>
not merely against the subtlest brains and deepest <lb/>
learning of France, but against the ignoblest deceits, <lb/>
the meanest treacheries, and the hardest hearts to <lb/>
be found in any land, pagan or Christian.</p>
<p>She was great in battle&#x2014;we all know that; great <lb/>
in foresight; great in loyalty and patriotism; great <lb/>
in persuading discontented chiefs and reconciling <lb/>
conflicting interests and passions; great in the ability <lb/>
to discover merit and genius wherever it lay hidden; <lb/>
great in picturesque and eloquent speech; supremely <lb/>
great in the gift of firing the hearts of hopeless men <lb/>
with noble enthusiasms, the gift of turning hares into <lb/>
heroes, slaves and skulkers into battalions that march <lb/>
to death with songs upon their lips. But all these <lb/>
are exalting activities; they keep hand and heart <lb/>
and brain keyed up to their work: there is the joy <lb/>
of achievement, the inspiration of stir and move- <lb/>
ment, the applause which hails success; the soul is <lb/>
overflowing with life and energy, the faculties are at <lb/>
white heat; weariness, despondency, inertia&#x2014;these <lb/>
do not exist.</p>
<p>Yes, Joan of Arc was great always, great every- <lb/>
<pb n="257"/>
where, but she was greatest in the Rouen trials. <lb/>
There she rose above the limitations and infirmities <lb/>
of our human nature, and accomplished under <lb/>
blighting and unnerving and hopeless conditions all <lb/>
that her splendid equipment of moral and intellectual <lb/>
forces could have accomplished if they had been <lb/>
supplemented by the mighty helps of hope and <lb/>
cheer and light, the presence of friendly faces, and <lb/>
a fair and equal fight, with the great world looking <lb/>
on and wondering.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XVIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Toward</smcap> the end of the ten-day interval the <lb/>
University of Paris rendered its decision con- <lb/>
cerning the Twelve Articles. By this finding, Joan <lb/>
was guilty upon all the counts: she must renounce <lb/>
her errors and make satisfaction, or be abandoned <lb/>
to the secular arm for punishment.</p>
<p>The University's mind was probably already made <lb/>
up before the Articles were laid before it; yet it <lb/>
took it from the fifth to the eighteenth to produce <lb/>
its verdict. I think the delay may have been caused <lb/>
by temporary difficulties concerning two points:</p>
<p>1, As to who the fiends were who were repre- <lb/>
sented in Joan's Voices;</p>
<p>2, As to whether her saints spoke French only.</p>
<p>You understand, the University decided emphatic- <lb/>
ally that it was fiends who spoke in those Voices; <lb/>
it would need to prove that, and it did. It found <lb/>
out who the fiends were, and named them in the <lb/>
verdict: Belial, Satan, and Behemoth. This has <lb/>
always seemed a doubtful thing to me, and not en- <lb/>
titled to much credit. I think so for this reason: <lb/>
if the University had actually known it was those <lb/>
three, it would for very consistency's sake have told <lb/>
<pb n="259"/>
<i>how</i> it knew it, and not stopped with the mere <lb/>
assertion, since it had made Joan explain how she <lb/>
knew they were <i>not</i> fiends. Does not that seem <lb/>
reasonable? To my mind the University's position <lb/>
was weak, and I will tell you why. It had claimed <lb/>
that Joan's angels were devils in disguise, and we <lb/>
all know that devils do disguise themselves as angels; <lb/>
up to that point the University's position was <lb/>
strong; but you see yourself that it eats it own <lb/>
argument when it turns around and pretends that <i>it</i> <lb/>
can tell who such apparitions are, while denying the <lb/>
like ability to a person with as good a head on her <lb/>
shoulders as the best one the University could <lb/>
produce.</p>
<p>The doctors of the University had to see those <lb/>
creatures in order to know; and if Joan was de- <lb/>
ceived, it is argument that they in their turn could <lb/>
also be deceived, for their insight and judgment <lb/>
were surely not clearer than hers.</p>
<p>As to the other point which I have thought may <lb/>
have proved a difficulty and cost the University <lb/>
delay, I will touch but a moment upon that, and <lb/>
pass on. The University decided that it was blas- <lb/>
phemy for Joan to say that her saints spoke French <lb/>
and not English, and were on the French side in <lb/>
political sympathies. I think that the thing which <lb/>
troubled the doctors of theology was this: they had <lb/>
decided that the three Voices were Satan and two <lb/>
other devils; but they had also decided that these <lb/>
Voices were <i>not</i> on the French side&#x2014;thereby tacitly <lb/>
<pb n="260"/>
asserting that they were on the English side; and if <lb/>
on the English side, then they must be angels and <lb/>
not devils. Otherwise, the situation was embarrass- <lb/>
ing. You see, the University being the wisest and <lb/>
deepest and most erudite body in the world, it would <lb/>
like to be logical if it could, for the sake of its repu- <lb/>
tation; therefore it would study and study, days <lb/>
and days, trying to find some good common-sense <lb/>
reason for proving the Voices devils in Article No. <lb/>
1 and proving them angels in Article No. 10. <lb/>
However, they had to give it up. They found no <lb/>
way out; and so, to this day, the University's ver- <lb/>
dict remains just so&#x2014;devils in No. 1, angels in No. <lb/>
10; and no way to reconcile the discrepancy.</p>
<p>The envoys brought the verdict to Rouen, and <lb/>
with it a letter for Cauchon which was full of fervid <lb/>
praise. The University complimented him on his <lb/>
zeal in hunting down this woman "whose venom <lb/>
had infected the faithful of the whole West," and <lb/>
as recompense it as good as promised him "a <lb/>
crown of imperishable glory in heaven." Only <i>that!</i> <lb/>
&#x2014;a crown in heaven; a promissory note and no <lb/>
indorser; always something away off yonder; not a <lb/>
word about the Archbishopric of Rouen, which was <lb/>
the thing Cauchon was destroying his soul for. A <lb/>
crown in heaven; it must have sounded like a sar- <lb/>
casm to him, after all his hard work. What should <lb/>
<i>he</i> do in heaven? he did not know anybody there.</p>
<p>On the nineteenth of May a court of fifty judges <lb/>
sat in the archiepiscopal palace to discuss Joan's <lb/>
<pb n="261"/>
fate. A few wanted her delivered over to the secular <lb/>
arm at once for punishment, but the rest insisted <lb/>
that she be once more "charitably admonished" <lb/>
first.</p>
<p>So the same court met in the castle on the twenty- <lb/>
third, and Joan was brought to the bar. Pierre <lb/>
Maurice, a canon of Rouen, made a speech to Joan <lb/>
in which he admonished her to save her life and her <lb/>
soul by renouncing her errors and surrendering to <lb/>
the Church. He finished with a stern threat: if <lb/>
she remained obstinate the damnation of her soul <lb/>
was certain, the destruction of her body probable. <lb/>
But Joan was immovable. She said:</p>
<p>"If I were under sentence, and saw the fire be- <lb/>
fore me, and the executioner ready to light it&#x2014; <lb/>
more, if I were in the fire itself, I would say none <lb/>
but the things which I have said in these trials; and <lb/>
I would abide by them till I died."</p>
<p>A deep silence followed now, which endured some <lb/>
moments. It lay upon me like a weight. I knew it <lb/>
for an omen. Then Cauchon, grave and solemn, <lb/>
turned to Pierre Maurice:</p>
<p>"Have you anything further to say?"</p>
<p>The priest bowed low, and said:</p>
<p>"Nothing, my lord."</p>
<p>"Prisoner at the bar, have you anything further <lb/>
to say?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Then the debate is closed. To-morrow, sen- <lb/>
tence will be pronounced. Remove the prisoner."</p>
<pb n="262"/>
<p>She seemed to go from the place erect and noble. <lb/>
But I do not know; my sight was dim with tears.</p>
<p>To-morrow&#x2014;twenty-fourth of May! Exactly a <lb/>
year since I saw her go speeding across the plain at <lb/>
the head of her troops, her silver helmet shining, <lb/>
her silvery cape fluttering in the wind, her white <lb/>
plumes flowing, her sword held aloft; saw her <lb/>
charge the Burgundian camp three times, and carry <lb/>
it; saw her wheel to the right and spur for the <lb/>
duke's reserves; saw her fling herself against it in <lb/>
the last assault she was ever to make. And now <lb/>
that fatal day was come again&#x2014;and see what it was <lb/>
bringing!</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XIX">
<pb n="263"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XIX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Joan</smcap> had been adjudged guilty of heresy, sor- <lb/>
cery, and all the other terrible crimes set forth <lb/>
in the Twelve Articles, and her life was in Cauchon's <lb/>
hands at last. He could send her to the stake at <lb/>
once. His work was finished now, you think? He <lb/>
was satisfied? Not at all. What would his Arch- <lb/>
bishopric be worth if the people should get the idea <lb/>
into their heads that this faction of interested priests, <lb/>
slaving under the English lash, had wrongly con- <lb/>
demned and burned Joan of Arc, Deliverer of <lb/>
France? That would be to make of her a holy <lb/>
martyr. Then her spirit would rise from her body's <lb/>
ashes, a thousand-fold re-enforced, and sweep the <lb/>
English domination into the sea, and Cauchon along <lb/>
with it. No, the victory was not complete yet. <lb/>
Joan's guilt must be established by evidence which <lb/>
would satisfy the people. Where was that evidence <lb/>
to be found? There was only one person in the <lb/>
world who could furnish it&#x2014;<i>Joan of Arc herself.</i> <lb/>
She must condemn herself, and in public&#x2014;at least <lb/>
she must <i>seem</i> to do it.</p>
<p>But how was this to be managed? Weeks had <lb/>
<pb n="264"/>
been spent already in trying to get her to surrender <lb/>
&#x2014;time wholly wasted; what was to persuade her <lb/>
now? Torture had been threatened, the fire had <lb/>
been threatened; what was left? Illness, deadly <lb/>
fatigue, and the sight of the fire, the presence of the <lb/>
fire! That was left.</p>
<p>Now that was a shrewd thought. She was but a <lb/>
girl after all, and, under illness and exhaustion, sub- <lb/>
ject to a girl's weaknesses.</p>
<p>Yes, it was shrewdly thought. She had tacitly <lb/>
said herself that under the bitter pains of the rack <lb/>
they would be able to extort a false confession from <lb/>
her. It was a hint worth remembering, and it was <lb/>
remembered.</p>
<p>She had furnished another hint at the same time: <lb/>
that as soon as the pains were gone, she would re- <lb/>
tract the confession. That hint was also remem- <lb/>
bered.</p>
<p>She had herself taught them what to do, you see. <lb/>
First, they must wear out her strength, then frighten <lb/>
her with the fire. Second, while the fright was on <lb/>
her, she must be made to sign a paper.</p>
<p>But she would demand a reading of the paper. <lb/>
They could not venture to refuse this, with the <lb/>
public there to hear. Suppose that during the read- <lb/>
ing her courage should return? she would refuse to <lb/>
sign then. Very well, even that difficulty could be <lb/>
got over. They could read a short paper of no im- <lb/>
portance, then slip a long and deadly one into its <lb/>
place and trick her into signing <i>that.</i></p>
<pb n="265"/>
<p>Yet there was still one other difficulty. If they <lb/>
made her seem to abjure, that would free her from <lb/>
the death penalty. They could keep her in a prison <lb/>
of the Church, but they could not kill her. That <lb/>
would not answer; for only her death would content <lb/>
the English. Alive she was a terror, in a prison or <lb/>
out of it. She had escaped from two prisons <lb/>
already.</p>
<p>But even that difficulty could be managed. Cau- <lb/>
chon would make promises to her; in return she <lb/>
would promise to leave off the male dress. He <lb/>
would violate his promises, and that would so situate <lb/>
her that she would not be able to keep hers. Her <lb/>
lapse would condemn her to the stake, and the stake <lb/>
would be ready.</p>
<p>These were the several moves; there was nothing <lb/>
to do but to make them, each in its order, and the <lb/>
game was won. One might almost name the day <lb/>
that the betrayed girl, the most innocent creature in <lb/>
France and the noblest, would go to her pitiful <lb/>
death.</p>
<p>And the time was favorable&#x2014;cruelly favorable. <lb/>
Joan's spirit had as yet suffered no decay, it was as <lb/>
sublime and masterful as ever; but her body's forces <lb/>
had been steadily wasting away in those last ten <lb/>
days, and a strong mind needs a healthy body for <lb/>
its rightful support.</p>
<p>The world knows now that Cauchon's plan was as <lb/>
I have sketched it to you, but the world did not <lb/>
know it at that time. There are sufficient indica- <lb/>
<pb n="266"/>
tions that Warwick and all the other English chiefs <lb/>
except the highest one&#x2014;the Cardinal of Winchester <lb/>
&#x2014;were not let into the secret; also, that only <lb/>
Loyseleur and Beaupere, on the French side, knew <lb/>
the scheme. Sometimes I have doubted if even <lb/>
Loyseleur and Beaupere knew the whole of it at <lb/>
first. However, if any did, it was these two.</p>
<p>It is usual to let the condemned pass their last <lb/>
night of life in peace, but this grace was denied to <lb/>
poor Joan, if one may credit the rumors of the <lb/>
time. Loyseleur was smuggled into her presence, <lb/>
and in the character of priest, friend, and secret <lb/>
partisan of France and hater of England, he spent <lb/>
some hours in beseeching her to do "the only right <lb/>
and righteous thing"&#x2014;submit to the Church, as a <lb/>
good Christian should; and that then she would <lb/>
straightway get out of the clutches of the dreaded <lb/>
English and be transferred to the Church's prison, <lb/>
where she would be honorably used and have women <lb/>
about her for jailers. He knew where to touch her. <lb/>
He knew how odious to her was the presence of her <lb/>
rough and profane English guards; he knew that <lb/>
her Voices had vaguely promised something which <lb/>
she interpreted to be escape, rescue, release of some <lb/>
sort, and the chance to burst upon France once <lb/>
more and victoriously complete the great work which <lb/>
she had been commissioned of Heaven to do. Also <lb/>
there was that other thing: if her failing body could <lb/>
be further weakened by loss of rest and sleep now, <lb/>
her tired mind would be dazed and drowsy on the <lb/>
<pb n="267"/>
morrow, and in ill condition to stand out against <lb/>
persuasions, threats, and the sight of the stake, and <lb/>
also be purblind to traps and snares which it would <lb/>
be swift to detect when in its normal estate.</p>
<p>I do not need to tell you that there was no rest <lb/>
for me that night. Nor for No&#x00EB;l. We went to the <lb/>
main gate of the city before nightfall, with a hope <lb/>
in our minds, based upon that vague prophecy of <lb/>
Joan's Voices which seemed to promise a rescue by <lb/>
force at the last moment. The immense news had <lb/>
flown swiftly far and wide that at last Joan of Arc <lb/>
was condemned, and would be sentenced and burned <lb/>
alive on the morrow; and so crowds of people were <lb/>
flowing in at the gate, and other crowds were being <lb/>
refused admission by the soldiery; these being peo- <lb/>
ple who brought doubtful passes or none at all. We <lb/>
scanned these crowds eagerly, but there was nothing <lb/>
about them to indicate that they were our old war- <lb/>
comrades in disguise, and certainly there were no <lb/>
familiar faces among them. And so, when the gate <lb/>
was closed at last, we turned away grieved, and <lb/>
more disappointed than we cared to admit, either in <lb/>
speech or thought.</p>
<p>The streets were surging tides of excited men. It <lb/>
was difficult to make one's way. Toward midnight <lb/>
our aimless tramp brought us to the neighborhood <lb/>
of the beautiful church of St. Ouen, and there all <lb/>
was bustle and work. The square was a wilderness <lb/>
of torches and people; and through a guarded <lb/>
passage dividing the pack, laborers were carrying <lb/>
<pb n="268"/>
planks and timbers and disappearing with them <lb/>
through the gate of the churchyard. We asked <lb/>
what was going forward; the answer was:</p>
<p>"Scaffolds and the stake. Don't you know that <lb/>
the French witch is to be burned in the morning?"</p>
<p>Then we went away. We had no heart for that <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>At dawn we were at the city gate again; this time <lb/>
with a hope which our wearied bodies and fevered <lb/>
minds magnified into a large probability. We had <lb/>
heard a report that the Abbot of Jumi&#x00E8;ges with all <lb/>
his monks was coming to witness the burning. Our <lb/>
desire, abetted by our imagination, turned those <lb/>
nine hundred monks into Joan's old campaigners, <lb/>
and their Abbot into La Hire or the Bastard or <lb/>
D'Alen&#x00E7;on; and we watched them file in, unchal- <lb/>
lenged, the multitude respectfully dividing and un- <lb/>
covering while they passed, with our hearts in our <lb/>
throats and our eyes swimming with tears of joy and <lb/>
pride and exultation; and we tried to catch glimpses <lb/>
of the faces under the cowls, and were prepared to <lb/>
give signal to any recognized face that we were <lb/>
Joan's men and ready and eager to kill and be killed <lb/>
in the good cause. How foolish we were; but we <lb/>
were young, you know, and youth hopeth all things, <lb/>
believeth all things.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XX">
<pb n="269"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> the morning I was at my official post. It was <lb/>
on a platform raised the height of a man, in the <lb/>
churchyard, under the eaves of St. Ouen. On this <lb/>
same platform was a crowd of priests and important <lb/>
citizens, and several lawyers. Abreast it, with a <lb/>
small space between, was another and larger plat- <lb/>
form, handsomely canopied against sun and rain, <lb/>
and richly carpeted; also it was furnished with <lb/>
comfortable chairs, and with two which were more <lb/>
sumptuous than the others, and raised above the <lb/>
general level. One of these two was occupied by a <lb/>
prince of the royal blood of England, his Eminence <lb/>
the Cardinal of Winchester; the other by Cauchon, <lb/>
Bishop of Beauvais. In the rest of the chairs sat <lb/>
three bishops, the Vice-Inquisitor, eight abbots, and <lb/>
the sixty-two friars and lawyers who had sat as <lb/>
Joan's judges in her late trials.</p>
<p>Twenty steps in front of the platforms was an- <lb/>
other&#x2014;a table-topped pyramid of stone, built up in <lb/>
retreating courses, thus forming steps. Out of this <lb/>
rose that grisly thing, the stake; about the stake <lb/>
bundles of fagots and firewood were piled. On the <lb/>
<pb n="270"/>
ground at the base of the pyramid stood three crim- <lb/>
son figures, the executioner and his assistants. At <lb/>
their feet lay what had been a goodly heap of <lb/>
brands, but was now a smokeless nest of ruddy <lb/>
coals; a foot or two from this was a supplemental <lb/>
supply of wood and fagots compacted into a pile <lb/>
shoulder-high and containing as much as six pack- <lb/>
horse loads. Think of that. We seem so delicately <lb/>
made, so destructible, so insubstantial; yet it is <lb/>
easier to reduce a granite statue to ashes than it is <lb/>
to do that with a man's body.</p>
<p>The sight of the stake sent physical pains tingling <lb/>
down the nerves of my body; and yet, turn as I <lb/>
would, my eyes would keep coming back to it, such <lb/>
fascination has the grewsome and the terrible for us.</p>
<p>The space occupied by the platforms and the <lb/>
stake was kept open by a wall of English soldiery, <lb/>
standing elbow to elbow, erect and stalwart figures, <lb/>
fine and sightly in their polished steel; while from <lb/>
behind them on every hand stretched far away a <lb/>
level plain of human heads; and there was no win- <lb/>
dow and no housetop within our view, howsoever <lb/>
distant, but was black with patches and masses of <lb/>
people.</p>
<p>But there was no noise, no stir; it was as if the <lb/>
world was dead. The impressiveness of this silence <lb/>
and solemnity was deepened by a leaden twilight, <lb/>
for the sky was hidden by a pall of low-hanging <lb/>
storm-clouds; and above the remote horizon faint <lb/>
winkings of heat-lightning played, and now and then <lb/>
<pb n="271"/>
one caught the dull mutterings and complainings of <lb/>
distant thunder.</p>
<p>At last the stillness was broken. From beyond <lb/>
the square rose an indistinct sound, but familiar&#x2014; <lb/>
curt, crisp phrases of command; next I saw the <lb/>
plain of heads dividing, and the steady swing of a <lb/>
marching host was glimpsed between. My heart <lb/>
leaped for a moment. Was it La Hire and his <lb/>
hellions? No&#x2014;that was not their gait. No, it <lb/>
was the prisoner and her escort; it was Joan of <lb/>
Arc, under guard, that was coming; my spirits sank <lb/>
as low as they had been before. Weak as she was <lb/>
they made her walk; they would increase her weak- <lb/>
ness all they could. The distance was not great&#x2014; <lb/>
it was but a few hundred yards&#x2014;but short as it was <lb/>
it was a heavy tax upon one who had been lying <lb/>
chained in one spot for months, and whose feet had <lb/>
lost their powers from inaction. Yes, and for a year <lb/>
Joan had known only the cool damps of a dungeon, <lb/>
and now she was dragging herself through this sultry <lb/>
summer heat, this airless and suffocating void. As <lb/>
she entered the gate, drooping with exhaustion, there <lb/>
was that creature Loyseleur at her side with his head <lb/>
bent to her ear. We knew afterward that he had <lb/>
been with her again this morning in the prison <lb/>
wearying her with his persuasions and enticing her <lb/>
with false promises, and that he was now still at the <lb/>
same work at the gate, imploring her to yield every- <lb/>
thing that would be required of her, and assuring <lb/>
her that if she would do this all would be well with <lb/>
<pb n="272"/>
her: she would be rid of the dreaded English and <lb/>
find safety in the powerful shelter and protection of <lb/>
the Church. A miserable man, a stony-hearted man!</p>
<p>The moment Joan was seated on the platform she <lb/>
closed her eyes and allowed her chin to fall; and so <lb/>
sat, with her hands nestling in her lap, indifferent to <lb/>
everything, caring for nothing but rest. And she <lb/>
was so white again&#x2014;white as alabaster.</p>
<p>How the faces of that packed mass of humanity <lb/>
lighted up with interest, and with what intensity all <lb/>
eyes gazed upon this fragile girl! And how natural <lb/>
it was; for these people realized that at last they <lb/>
were looking upon that person whom they had so <lb/>
long hungered to see; a person whose name and <lb/>
fame filled all Europe, and made all other names <lb/>
and all other renowns insignificant by comparison: <lb/>
Joan of Arc, the wonder of the time, and destined <lb/>
to be the wonder of all times! And I could read as <lb/>
by print, in their marveling countenances, the words <lb/>
that were drifting through their minds: "Can it be <lb/>
true; is it believable, that it is this little creature, <lb/>
this girl, this child with the good face, the sweet <lb/>
face, the beautiful face, the dear and bonny face, <lb/>
that has carried fortresses by storm, charged at the <lb/>
head of victorious armies, blown the might of Eng- <lb/>
land out of her path with a breath, and fought a <lb/>
long campaign, solitary and alone, against the <lb/>
massed brains and learning of France&#x2014;and had <lb/>
won it if the fight had been fair!"</p>
<p>Evidently Cauchon had grown afraid of Manchon <lb/>
<pb n="273"/>
because of his pretty apparent leanings toward Joan, <lb/>
for another recorder was in the chief place here, <lb/>
which left my master and me nothing to do but sit <lb/>
idle and look on.</p>
<p>Well, I supposed that everything had been done <lb/>
which could be thought of to tire Joan's body and <lb/>
mind, but it was a mistake; one more device had <lb/>
been invented. This was to preach a long sermon <lb/>
to her in that oppressive heat.</p>
<p>When the preacher began, she cast up one dis- <lb/>
tressed and disappointed look, then dropped her <lb/>
head again. This preacher was Guillaume Erard, <lb/>
an oratorical celebrity. He got his text from the <lb/>
Twelve Lies. He emptied upon Joan all the calum- <lb/>
nies in detail that had been bottled up in that mess <lb/>
of venom, and called her all the brutal names that <lb/>
the Twelve were labeled with, working himself into <lb/>
a whirlwind of fury as he went on; but his labors <lb/>
were wasted, she seemed lost in dreams, she made <lb/>
no sign, she did not seem to hear. At last he <lb/>
launched this apostrophe:</p>
<p>"O France, how hast thou been abused! Thou <lb/>
hast always been the home of Christianity; but now, <lb/>
Charles, who calls himself thy King and governor, <lb/>
indorses, like the heretic and schismatic that he is, <lb/>
the words and deeds of a worthless and infamous <lb/>
woman!" Joan raised her head, and her eyes began <lb/>
to burn and flash. The preacher turned toward <lb/>
her: "It is to you, Joan, that I speak, and I tell <lb/>
you that your King is schismatic and a heretic!"</p>
<pb n="274"/>
<p>Ah, he might abuse <i>her</i> to his heart's content; <lb/>
she could endure that; but to her dying moment <lb/>
she could never hear in patience a word against that <lb/>
ingrate, that treacherous dog our King, whose <lb/>
proper place was here, at this moment, sword in <lb/>
hand, routing these reptiles and saving this most <lb/>
noble servant that ever King had in this world&#x2014;and <lb/>
he <i>would</i> have been there if he had not been what I <lb/>
have called him. Joan's loyal soul was outraged, <lb/>
and she turned upon the preacher and flung out a <lb/>
few words with a spirit which the crowd recognized <lb/>
as being in accordance with the Joan of Arc tradi- <lb/>
tions:</p>
<p>"By my faith, sir! I make bold to say and <lb/>
swear, on pain of death, that he is the most noble <lb/>
Christian of all Christians, and the best lover of the <lb/>
faith and the Church!"</p>
<p>There was an explosion of applause from the <lb/>
crowd&#x2014;which angered the preacher, for he had <lb/>
been aching long to hear an expression like this, and <lb/>
now that it was come at last it had fallen to the <lb/>
wrong person: he had done all the work; the other <lb/>
had carried off all the spoil. He stamped his foot <lb/>
and shouted to the sheriff:</p>
<p>"Make her shut up!"</p>
<p>That made the crowd laugh.</p>
<p>A mob has small respect for a grown man who <lb/>
has to call on a sheriff to protect him from a sick <lb/>
girl.</p>
<p>Joan had damaged the preacher's cause more with <lb/>
<pb n="275"/>
one sentence than he had helped it with a hundred; <lb/>
so he was much put out, and had trouble to get a <lb/>
good start again. But he needn't have bothered; <lb/>
there was no occasion. It was mainly an English- <lb/>
feeling mob. It had but obeyed a law of our nature <lb/>
&#x2014;an irresistible law&#x2014;to enjoy and applaud a <lb/>
spirited and promptly delivered retort, no matter <lb/>
who makes it. The mob was with the preacher; it <lb/>
had been beguiled for a moment, but only that; it <lb/>
would soon return. It was there to see this girl <lb/>
burnt; so that it got that satisfaction&#x2014;without <lb/>
too much delay&#x2014;it would be content.</p>
<p>Presently the preacher formally summoned Joan <lb/>
to submit to the Church. He made the demand <lb/>
with confidence, for he had gotten the idea from <lb/>
Loyseleur and Beaupere that she was worn to the <lb/>
bone, exhausted, and would not be able to put forth <lb/>
any more resistance; and, indeed, to look at her it <lb/>
seemed that they must be right. Nevertheless, she <lb/>
made one more effort to hold her ground, and said, <lb/>
wearily:</p>
<p>"As to that matter, I have answered my judges <lb/>
before. I have told them to report all that I have <lb/>
said and done to our holy Father the Pope&#x2014;to <lb/>
whom, and to God first, I appeal."</p>
<p>Again, out of her native wisdom, she had brought <lb/>
those words of tremendous import, but was ignorant <lb/>
of their value. But they could have availed her <lb/>
nothing in any case now, with the stake there and <lb/>
these thousands of enemies about her. Yet they <lb/>
<pb n="276"/>
made every churchman there blench, and the <lb/>
preacher changed the subject with all haste. Well <lb/>
might those criminals blench, for Joan's appeal of <lb/>
her case to the Pope stripped Cauchon at once of <lb/>
jurisdiction over it, and annulled all that he and his <lb/>
judges had already done in the matter and all that <lb/>
they should do in it thenceforth.</p>
<p>Joan went on presently to reiterate, after some <lb/>
further talk, that she had acted by command of God <lb/>
in her deeds and utterances; then, when an attempt <lb/>
was made to implicate the King, and friends of hers <lb/>
and his, she stopped that. She said:</p>
<p>"I charge my deeds and words upon no one, <lb/>
neither upon my King nor any other. If there is <lb/>
any fault in them, I am responsible and no other."</p>
<p>She was asked if she would not recant those of <lb/>
her words and deeds which had been pronounced <lb/>
evil by her judges. Her answer made confusion and <lb/>
damage again:</p>
<p>"I submit them to God and the Pope."</p>
<p>The Pope once more! It was very embarrassing. <lb/>
Here was a person who was asked to submit her <lb/>
case to the Church, and who frankly consents&#x2014; <lb/>
offers to submit it to the very head of it. What <lb/>
more could any one require? How was one to <lb/>
answer such a formidably unanswerable answer as <lb/>
that?</p>
<p>The worried judges put their heads together and <lb/>
whispered and planned and discussed. Then they <lb/>
brought forth this sufficiently shambling conclusion <lb/>
<pb n="277"/>
&#x2014;but it was the best they could do, in so close a <lb/>
place: they said the Pope was so far away; and it <lb/>
was not necessary to go to him anyway, because <lb/>
these present judges had sufficient power and au- <lb/>
thority to deal with the present case, and were in <lb/>
effect "the Church" to that extent. At another <lb/>
time they could have smiled at this conceit, but not <lb/>
now; they were not comfortable enough now.</p>
<p>The mob was getting impatient. It was beginning <lb/>
to put on a threatening aspect; it was tired of stand- <lb/>
ing, tired of the scorching heat; and the thunder <lb/>
was coming nearer, the lightning was flashing <lb/>
brighter. It was necessary to hurry this matter to <lb/>
a close. Erard showed Joan a written form, which <lb/>
had been prepared and made all ready beforehand, <lb/>
and asked her to abjure.</p>
<p>"Abjure? What is abjure?"</p>
<p>She did not know the word. It was explained to <lb/>
her by Massieu. She tried to understand, but she <lb/>
was breaking, under exhaustion, and she could <lb/>
not gather the meaning. It was all a jumble and <lb/>
confusion of strange words. In her despair she sent <lb/>
out this beseeching cry:</p>
<p>"I appeal to the Church universal whether I <lb/>
ought to abjure or no!"</p>
<p>Erard exclaimed:</p>
<p>"You shall abjure instantly, or instantly be <lb/>
burnt!"</p>
<p>She glanced up, at those awful words, and for the <lb/>
first time she saw the stake and the mass of red <lb/>
<pb n="278"/>
coals&#x2014;redder and angrier than ever now under the <lb/>
constantly deepening storm-gloom. She gasped and <lb/>
staggered up out of her seat muttering and mum- <lb/>
bling incoherently, and gazed vacantly upon the <lb/>
people and the scene about her like one who is <lb/>
dazed, or thinks he dreams, and does not know <lb/>
where he is.</p>
<p>The priests crowded about her imploring her to <lb/>
sign the paper, there were many voices beseeching <lb/>
and urging her at once, there was great turmoil and <lb/>
shouting and excitement among the populace and <lb/>
everywhere.</p>
<p>"Sign! sign!" from the priests; "sign&#x2014;sign <lb/>
and be saved!" And Loyseleur was urging at her <lb/>
ear, "Do as I told you&#x2014;do not destroy yourself!"</p>
<p>Joan said plaintively to these people:</p>
<p>"Ah, you do not do well to seduce me."</p>
<p>The judges joined their voices to the others. Yes, <lb/>
even the iron in <i>their</i> hearts melted, and they said:</p>
<p>"O Joan, we pity you so! Take back what <lb/>
you have said, or we must deliver you up to punish- <lb/>
ment."</p>
<p>And now there was another voice&#x2014;it was from <lb/>
the other platform&#x2014;pealing solemnly above the <lb/>
din: Cauchon's&#x2014;reading the sentence of death!</p>
<p>Joan's strength was all spent. She stood looking <lb/>
about her in a bewildered way a moment, then <lb/>
slowly she sank to her knees, and bowed her head <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"I submit."</p>
<pb n="279"/>
<p>They gave her no time to reconsider&#x2014;they knew <lb/>
the peril of that. The moment the words were out <lb/>
of her mouth Massieu was reading to her the abjura- <lb/>
tion, and she was repeating the words after him <lb/>
mechanically, unconsciously&#x2014;and <i>smiling;</i> for her <lb/>
wandering mind was far away in some happier <lb/>
world.</p>
<p>Then this short paper of six lines was slipped <lb/>
aside and a long one of many pages was smuggled <lb/>
into its place, and she, noting nothing, put her mark <lb/>
to it, saying, in pathetic apology, that she did not <lb/>
know how to write. But a secretary of the King of <lb/>
England was there to take care of that defect; he <lb/>
guided her hand with his own, and wrote her name <lb/>
&#x2014;<foreign lang="fre"><i>Jehanne</i>.</foreign></p>
<p>The great crime was accomplished. She had <lb/>
signed&#x2014;what? She did not know&#x2014;but the others <lb/>
knew. She had signed a paper confessing herself a <lb/>
sorceress, a dealer with devils, a liar, a blasphemer <lb/>
of God and His angels, a lover of blood, a promoter <lb/>
of sedition, cruel, wicked, commissioned of Satan; <lb/>
and this signature of her bound her to resume the <lb/>
dress of a woman. There were other promises, but <lb/>
that one would answer, without the others; that one <lb/>
could be made to destroy her.</p>
<p>Loyseleur pressed forward and praised her for <lb/>
having done "such a good day's work."</p>
<p>But she was still dreamy, she hardly heard.</p>
<p>Then Cauchon pronounced the words which dis- <lb/>
solved the excommunication and restored her to her <lb/>
<pb n="280"/>
beloved Church, with all the dear privileges of wor- <lb/>
ship. Ah, she heard that! You could see it in the <lb/>
deep gratitude that rose in her face and transfigured <lb/>
it with joy.</p>
<p>But how transient was that happiness! For <lb/>
Cauchon, without a tremor of pity in his voice, <lb/>
added these crushing words:</p>
<p>"And that she may repent of her crimes and re- <lb/>
peat them no more, she is sentenced to perpetual <lb/>
imprisonment, with the bread of affliction and the <lb/>
water of anguish!"</p>
<p><i>Perpetual imprisonment!</i> She had never dreamed <lb/>
of that&#x2014;such a thing had never been hinted to her <lb/>
by Loyseleur or by any other. Loyseleur had dis- <lb/>
tinctly said and promised that "all would be well <lb/>
with her." And the very last words spoken to her <lb/>
by Erard, on that very platform, when he was urg- <lb/>
ing her to abjure, was a straight, unqualified promise <lb/>
&#x2014;that if she would do it she should <i>go free from <lb/>
captivity</i>.</p>
<p>She stood stunned and speechless a moment; <lb/>
then she remembered, with such solacement as the <lb/>
thought could furnish, that by another clear promise <lb/>
&#x2014;a promise made by Cauchon himself&#x2014;she would <lb/>
at least be the Church's captive, and have women <lb/>
about her in place of a brutal foreign soldiery. So <lb/>
she turned to the body of priests and said, with a sad <lb/>
resignation:</p>
<p>"Now, you men of the Church, take me to your <lb/>
prison, and leave me no longer in the hands of the <lb/>
<pb n="281"/>
English;" and she gathered up her chains and pre- <lb/>
pared to move.</p>
<p>But alas! now came these shameful words from <lb/>
Cauchon&#x2014;and with them a mocking laugh:</p>
<p>"Take her to the prison whence she came!"</p>
<p>Poor abused girl! She stood dumb, smitten, <lb/>
paralyzed. It was pitiful to see. She had been <lb/>
beguiled, lied to, betrayed; she saw it all now.</p>
<p>The rumbling of a drum broke upon the stillness, <lb/>
and for just one moment she thought of the glorious <lb/>
deliverance promised by her Voices&#x2014;I read it in <lb/>
the rapture that lit her face; then she saw what it <lb/>
was&#x2014;her prison escort&#x2014;and that light faded, <lb/>
never to revive again. And now her head began a <lb/>
piteous rocking motion, swaying slowly, this way <lb/>
and that, as is the way when one is suffering un- <lb/>
wordable pain, or when one's heart is broken; then <lb/>
drearily she went from us, with her face in her <lb/>
hands, and sobbing bitterly.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>There</smcap> is no certainty that any one in all Rouen <lb/>
was in the secret of the deep game which <lb/>
Cauchon was playing except the Cardinal of Win- <lb/>
chester. Then you can imagine the astonishment <lb/>
and stupefaction of that vast mob gathered there and <lb/>
those crowds of churchmen assembled on the two <lb/>
platforms, when they saw Joan of Arc moving away, <lb/>
alive and whole&#x2014;slipping out of their grip at last, <lb/>
after all this tedious waiting, all this tantalizing ex- <lb/>
pectancy.</p>
<p>Nobody was able to stir or speak for a while, so <lb/>
paralyzing was the universal astonishment, so unbe- <lb/>
lievable the fact that the stake was actually standing <lb/>
there unoccupied and its prey gone. Then sud- <lb/>
denly everybody broke into a fury of rage; maledic- <lb/>
tions and charges of treachery began to fly freely; <lb/>
yes, and even stones: a stone came near killing the <lb/>
Cardinal of Winchester&#x2014;it just missed his head. <lb/>
But the man who threw it was not to blame, for he <lb/>
was excited, and a person who is excited never can <lb/>
throw straight.</p>
<p>The tumult was very great, indeed, for a while. <lb/>
<pb n="283"/>
In the midst of it a chaplain of the Cardinal even <lb/>
forgot the proprieties so far as to opprobriously <lb/>
assail the august Bishop of Beauvais himself, shaking <lb/>
his fist in his face and shouting:</p>
<p>"By God, you are a traitor!"</p>
<p>"You lie!" responded the Bishop.</p>
<p><i>He</i> a traitor! Oh, far from it; he certainly was <lb/>
the last Frenchman that any Briton had a right to <lb/>
bring that charge against.</p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick lost his temper too. He <lb/>
was a doughty soldier, but when it came to the <lb/>
intellectuals&#x2014;when it came to delicate chicane, and <lb/>
scheming, and trickery&#x2014;he couldn't see any further <lb/>
through a millstone than another. So he burst out <lb/>
in his frank warrior fashion, and swore that the King <lb/>
of England was being treacherously used, and that <lb/>
Joan of Arc was going to be allowed to cheat the <lb/>
stake. But they whispered comfort into his ear:</p>
<p>"Give yourself no uneasiness, my lord; we shall <lb/>
soon have her again."</p>
<p>Perhaps the like tidings found their way all <lb/>
around, for good news travels fast as well as bad. <lb/>
At any rate the ragings presently quieted down, and <lb/>
the huge concourse crumbled apart and disappeared. <lb/>
And thus we reached the noon of that fearful <lb/>
Thursday.</p>
<p>We two youths were happy; happier than any <lb/>
words can tell&#x2014;for we were not in the secret any <lb/>
more than the rest. Joan's life was saved. We <lb/>
knew that, and that was enough. France would <lb/>
<pb n="284"/>
hear of this day's infamous work&#x2014;and then! <lb/>
Why, then her gallant sons would flock to her <lb/>
standard by thousands and thousands, multitudes <lb/>
upon multitudes, and their wrath would be like the <lb/>
wrath of the ocean when the storm-winds sweep it; <lb/>
and they would hurl themselves against this doomed <lb/>
city and overwhelm it like the resistless tides of that <lb/>
ocean, and Joan of Arc would march again! In <lb/>
six days&#x2014;seven days&#x2014;one short week&#x2014;noble <lb/>
France, grateful France, indignant France, would be <lb/>
thundering at these gates&#x2014;let us count the hours, <lb/>
let us count the minutes, let us count the seconds! <lb/>
O happy day, O day of ecstasy, how our hearts <lb/>
sang in our bosoms!</p>
<p>For we were young, then; yes, we were very <lb/>
young.</p>
<p>Do you think the exhausted prisoner was allowed <lb/>
to rest and sleep after she had spent the small rem- <lb/>
nant of her strength in dragging her tired body back <lb/>
to the dungeon?</p>
<p>No; there was no rest for her, with those sleuth- <lb/>
hounds on her track. Cauchon and some of his <lb/>
people followed her to her lair straightway; they <lb/>
found her dazed and dull, her mental and physical <lb/>
forces in a state of prostration. They told her she <lb/>
had abjured; that she had made certain promises&#x2014; <lb/>
among them, to resume the apparel of her sex; and <lb/>
that if she relapsed, the Church would cast her out <lb/>
for good and all. She heard the words, but they <lb/>
had no meaning to her. She was like a person who <lb/>
<pb n="285"/>
has taken a narcotic and is dying for sleep, dying <lb/>
for rest from nagging, dying to be let alone, and <lb/>
who mechanically does everything the persecutor <lb/>
asks, taking but dull note of the things done, and <lb/>
but dully recording them in the memory. And so <lb/>
Joan put on the gown which Cauchon and his people <lb/>
had brought; and would come to herself by and by, <lb/>
and have at first but a dim idea as to when and how <lb/>
the change had come about.</p>
<p>Cauchon went away happy and content. Joan <lb/>
had resumed woman's dress without protest; also <lb/>
she had been formally warned against relapsing. He <lb/>
had witnesses to these facts. How could matters <lb/>
be better?</p>
<p>But suppose she should <i>not</i> relapse?</p>
<p>Why, then she must be forced to do it.</p>
<p>Did Cauchon hint to the English guards that <lb/>
thenceforth if they chose to make their prisoner's <lb/>
captivity crueler and bitterer than ever, no official <lb/>
notice would be taken of it? Perhaps so; since the <lb/>
guards did begin that policy at once, and no official <lb/>
notice <i>was</i> taken of it. Yes, from that moment <lb/>
Joan's life in that dungeon was made almost unen- <lb/>
durable. Do not ask me to enlarge upon it. I will <lb/>
not do it.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXII">
<pb n="286"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Friday</smcap> and Saturday were happy days for No&#x00EB;l <lb/>
and me. Our minds were full of our splendid <lb/>
dream of France aroused&#x2014;France shaking her <lb/>
mane&#x2014;France on the march&#x2014;France at the gates <lb/>
&#x2014;Rouen in ashes, and Joan free! Our imagination <lb/>
was on fire; we were delirious with pride and joy. <lb/>
For we were very young, as I have said.</p>
<p>We knew nothing about what had been happening <lb/>
in the dungeon the yester-afternoon. We supposed <lb/>
that as Joan had abjured and been taken back into <lb/>
the forgiving bosom of the Church, she was being <lb/>
gently used now, and her captivity made as pleasant <lb/>
and comfortable for her as the circumstances would <lb/>
allow. So, in high contentment, we planned out our <lb/>
share in the great rescue, and fought our part of the <lb/>
fight over and over again during those two happy <lb/>
days&#x2014;as happy days as ever I have known.</p>
<p>Sunday morning came. I was awake, enjoying <lb/>
the balmy, lazy weather, and thinking. Thinking <lb/>
of the rescue&#x2014;what else? I had no other thought <lb/>
now. I was absorbed in that, drunk with the happi- <lb/>
ness of it.</p>
<pb n="287"/>
<p>I heard a voice shouting far down the street, and <lb/>
soon it came nearer, and I caught the words:</p>
<p>"<i>Joan of Arc has relapsed! The witch's time <lb/>
has come!"</i></p>
<p>It stopped my heart, it turned my blood to ice. <lb/>
That was more than sixty years ago, but that <lb/>
triumphant note rings as clear in my memory to-day <lb/>
as it rang in my ear that long-vanished summer <lb/>
morning. We are so strangely made; the memories <lb/>
that could make us happy pass away; it is the <lb/>
memories that break our hearts that abide.</p>
<p>Soon other voices took up that cry&#x2014;tens, scores, <lb/>
hundreds of voices; all the world seemed filled with <lb/>
the brutal joy of it. And there were other clamors <lb/>
&#x2014;the clatter of rushing feet, merry congratulations, <lb/>
bursts of coarse laughter, the rolling of drums, the <lb/>
boom and crash of distant bands profaning the <lb/>
sacred day with the music of victory and thanks- <lb/>
giving.</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon came a sum- <lb/>
mons for Manchon and me to go to Joan's dungeon <lb/>
&#x2014;a summons from Cauchon. But by that time <lb/>
distrust had already taken possession of the English <lb/>
and their soldiery again, and all Rouen was in an <lb/>
angry and threatening mood. We could see plenty <lb/>
of evidences of this from our own windows&#x2014;fist- <lb/>
shaking, black looks, tumultuous tides of furious men <lb/>
billowing by along the street.</p>
<p>And we learned that up at the castle things were <lb/>
going very badly, indeed; that there was a great <lb/>
<pb n="288"/>
mob gathered there who considered the relapse a lie <lb/>
and a priestly trick, and among them many half- <lb/>
drunk English soldiers. Moreover, these people had <lb/>
gone beyond words. They had laid hands upon a <lb/>
number of churchmen who were trying to enter the <lb/>
castle, and it had been difficult work to rescue them <lb/>
and save their lives.</p>
<p>And so Manchon refused to go. He said he <lb/>
would not go a step without a safeguard from War- <lb/>
wick. So next morning Warwick sent an escort of <lb/>
soldiers, and then we went. Matters had not grown <lb/>
peacefuler meantime, but worse. The soldiers pro- <lb/>
tected us from bodily damage, but as we passed <lb/>
through the great mob at the castle we were assailed <lb/>
with insults and shameful epithets. I bore it well <lb/>
enough, though, and said to myself, with secret <lb/>
satisfaction, "In three or four short days, my lads, <lb/>
you will be employing your tongues in a different <lb/>
sort from this&#x2014;and I shall be there to hear."</p>
<p>To my mind these were as good as dead men. <lb/>
How many of them would still be alive after the <lb/>
rescue that was coming? Not more than enough to <lb/>
amuse the executioner a short half-hour, certainly.</p>
<p>It turned out that the report was true. Joan had <lb/>
relapsed. She was sitting there in her chains, <lb/>
clothed again in her male attire.</p>
<p>She accused nobody. That was her way. It was <lb/>
not in her character to hold a servant to account for <lb/>
what his master had made him do, and her mind <lb/>
had cleared now, and she knew that the advantage <lb/>
<pb n="289"/>
which had been taken of her the previous morning <lb/>
had its origin, not in the subordinate, but in the <lb/>
master&#x2014;Cauchon.</p>
<p>Here is what had happened. While Joan slept, in <lb/>
the early morning of Sunday, one of the guards <lb/>
stole her female apparel and put her male attire in <lb/>
its place. When she woke she asked for the other <lb/>
dress, but the guards refused to give it back. She <lb/>
protested, and said she was forbidden to wear the <lb/>
male dress. But they continued to refuse. She <lb/>
had to have clothing, for modesty's sake; moreover, <lb/>
she saw that she could not save her life if she must <lb/>
fight for it against treacheries like this; so she put on <lb/>
the forbidden garments, knowing what the end would <lb/>
be. She was weary of the struggle, poor thing.</p>
<p>We had followed in the wake of Cauchon, the <lb/>
Vice-Inquisitor, and the others&#x2014;six or eight&#x2014;and <lb/>
when I saw Joan sitting there, despondent, forlorn, <lb/>
and still in chains, when I was expecting to find her <lb/>
situation so different, I did not know what to make <lb/>
of it. The shock was very great. I had doubted <lb/>
the relapse perhaps; possibly I had believed in it, <lb/>
but had not realized it.</p>
<p>Cauchon's victory was complete. He had had a <lb/>
harassed and irritated and disgusted look for a long <lb/>
time, but that was all gone now, and contentment <lb/>
and serenity had taken its place. His purple face <lb/>
was full of tranquil and malicious happiness. He <lb/>
went trailing his robes and stood grandly in front of <lb/>
Joan, with his legs apart, and remained so more than <lb/>
<pb n="290"/>
a minute, gloating over her and enjoying the sight <lb/>
of this poor ruined creature, who had won so lofty a <lb/>
place for him in the service of the meek and merci- <lb/>
ful Jesus, Saviour of the World, Lord of the Uni- <lb/>
verse&#x2014;in case England kept her promise to him, <lb/>
who kept no promises himself.</p>
<p>Presently the judges began to question Joan. One <lb/>
of them, named Marguerie, who was a man with <lb/>
more insight than prudence, remarked upon Joan's <lb/>
change of clothing, and said:</p>
<p>"There is something suspicious about this. How <lb/>
could it have come about without connivance on the <lb/>
part of others? Perhaps even something worse?"</p>
<p>"Thousand devils!" screamed Cauchon, in a <lb/>
fury. "Will you shut your mouth?"</p>
<p>"Armagnac! Traitor!" shouted the soldiers on <lb/>
guard, and made a rush for Marguerie with their <lb/>
lances leveled. It was with the greatest difficulty <lb/>
that he was saved from being run through the body. <lb/>
He made no more attempts to help the inquiry, <lb/>
poor man. The other judges proceeded with the <lb/>
questionings.</p>
<p>"Why have you resumed this male habit?"</p>
<p>I did not quite catch her answer, for just then a <lb/>
soldier's halberd slipped from his fingers and fell on <lb/>
the stone floor with a crash; but I thought I under- <lb/>
stood Joan to say that she had resumed it of her <lb/>
own motion.</p>
<p>"But you have promised and sworn that you <lb/>
would not go back to it."</p>
<pb n="291"/>
<p>I was full of anxiety to hear her answer to that <lb/>
question; and when it came it was just what I was <lb/>
expecting. She said&#x2014;quite quietly:</p>
<p>"I have never intended and never understood <lb/>
myself to swear I would not resume it."</p>
<p>There&#x2014;I had been sure, all along, that she did <lb/>
not know what she was doing and saying on the <lb/>
platform Thursday, and this answer of hers was <lb/>
proof that I had not been mistaken. Then she went <lb/>
on to add this:</p>
<p>"But I had a right to resume it, because the <lb/>
promises made to me have not been kept&#x2014;promises <lb/>
that I should be allowed to go to mass and receive <lb/>
the communion, and that I should be freed from the <lb/>
bondage of these chains&#x2014;but they are still upon <lb/>
me, as you see."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, you have abjured, and have es- <lb/>
pecially promised to return no more to the dress of <lb/>
a man."</p>
<p>Then Joan held out her fettered hands sorrowfully <lb/>
toward these unfeeling men and said:</p>
<p>"I would rather die than continue so. But if <lb/>
they may be taken off, and if I may hear mass, and <lb/>
be removed to a penitential prison, and have a <lb/>
woman about me, I will be good, and will do what <lb/>
shall seem good to you that I do."</p>
<p>Cauchon sniffed scoffingly at that. Honor the <lb/>
compact which he and his had made with her? <lb/>
Fulfill its conditions? What need of that? Condi- <lb/>
tions had been a good thing to concede, tempo- <lb/>
<pb n="292"/>
rarily, and for advantage; but they had served their <lb/>
turn&#x2014;let something of a fresher sort and of more <lb/>
consequence be considered. The resumption of the <lb/>
male dress was sufficient for all practical purposes, <lb/>
but perhaps Joan could be led to add something to <lb/>
that fatal crime. So Cauchon asked her if her <lb/>
Voices had spoken to her since Thursday&#x2014;and he <lb/>
reminded her of her abjuration.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered; and then it came out that <lb/>
the Voices had talked with her about the abjuration <lb/>
&#x2014;<i>told</i> her about it, I suppose. She guilelessly re- <lb/>
asserted the heavenly origin of her mission, and did <lb/>
it with the untroubled mien of one who was not <lb/>
conscious that she had ever knowingly repudiated it. <lb/>
So I was convinced once more that she had had no <lb/>
notion of what she was doing that Thursday morn- <lb/>
ing on the platform. Finally she said, "My Voices <lb/>
told me I did very wrong to confess that what I had <lb/>
done was not well." Then she sighed, and said <lb/>
with simplicity, "But it was the fear of the fire that <lb/>
made me do so."</p>
<p>That is, fear of the fire had made her sign a paper <lb/>
whose contents she had not understood then, but <lb/>
understood now by revelation of her Voices and by <lb/>
testimony of her persecutors.</p>
<p>She was sane now and not exhausted; her cour- <lb/>
age had come back, and with it her inborn loyalty <lb/>
to the truth. She was bravely and serenely speak- <lb/>
ing it again, knowing that it would deliver her body <lb/>
up to that very fire which had such terrors for her.</p>
<pb n="293"/>
<p>That answer of hers was quite long, quite frank, <lb/>
wholly free from concealments or palliations. It <lb/>
made me shudder; I knew she was pronouncing <lb/>
sentence of death upon herself. So did poor Man- <lb/>
chon. And he wrote in the margin abreast of it:</p>
<p><smcap>Responsio mortifera</smcap>.</p>
<p><i>Fatal answer</i>. Yes, all present knew that it was, <lb/>
indeed, a fatal answer. Then there fell a silence <lb/>
such as falls in a sick-room when the watchers by <lb/>
the dying draw a deep breath and say softly one to <lb/>
another, "All is over."</p>
<p>Here, likewise, all was over; but after some mo- <lb/>
ments Cauchon, wishing to clinch this matter and <lb/>
make it final, put this question:</p>
<p>"Do you still believe that your Voices are St. <lb/>
Marguerite and St. Catherine?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;and that they come from God."</p>
<p>"Yet you denied them on the scaffold?"</p>
<p>Then she made direct and clear affirmation that <lb/>
she had never had any intention to deny them; and <lb/>
that if&#x2014;I noted the <i>if</i>&#x2014;"if she had made some re- <lb/>
tractions and revocations on the scaffold it was from <lb/>
fear of the fire, and was a violation of the truth."</p>
<p>There it is again, you see. She certainly never <lb/>
knew what it was she had done on the scaffold until <lb/>
she was told of it afterward by these people and by <lb/>
her Voices.</p>
<p>And now she closed this most painful scene with <lb/>
these words; and there was a weary note in them <lb/>
that was pathetic:</p>
<pb n="294"/>
<p>"I would rather do my penance all at once; let <lb/>
me die. I cannot endure captivity any longer."</p>
<p>The spirit born for sunshine and liberty so longed <lb/>
for release that it would take it in any form, even <lb/>
that.</p>
<p>Several among the company of judges went from <lb/>
the place troubled and sorrowful, the others in an- <lb/>
other mood. In the court of the castle we found <lb/>
the Earl of Warwick and fifty English waiting, im- <lb/>
patient for news. As soon as Cauchon saw them <lb/>
he shouted&#x2014;<i>laughing</i>&#x2014;think of a man destroying <lb/>
a friendless poor girl and then having the heart to <lb/>
laugh at it:</p>
<p>"Make yourselves comfortable&#x2014;it's all over with <lb/>
her!"</p>
</div2>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> young can sink into abysses of despondency, <lb/>
and it was so with No&#x00EB;l and me now; but the <lb/>
hopes of the young are quick to rise again, and it <lb/>
was so with ours. We called back that vague <lb/>
promise of the Voices, and said the one to the <lb/>
other that the glorious release was to happen at <lb/>
"the last moment"&#x2014;"that other time was not the <lb/>
last moment, but this is; it will happen now; the <lb/>
King will come, La Hire will come, and with them <lb/>
our veterans, and behind them all France!" And <lb/>
so we were full of heart again, and could already <lb/>
hear, in fancy, that stirring music the clash of steel <lb/>
and the war-cries and the uproar of the onset, and <lb/>
in fancy see our prisoner free, her chains gone, her <lb/>
sword in her hand.</p>
<p>But this dream was to pass also, and come to <lb/>
nothing. Late at night, when Manchon came in, <lb/>
he said:</p>
<p>"I am come from the dungeon, and I have a <lb/>
message for you from that poor child."</p>
<p>A message to me! If he had been noticing I <lb/>
think he would have discovered me&#x2014;discovered <lb/>
<pb n="296"/>
that my indifference concerning the prisoner was a <lb/>
pretense; for I was caught off my guard, and was <lb/>
so moved and so exalted to be so honored by her <lb/>
that I must have shown my feeling in my face and <lb/>
manner.</p>
<p>"A message for me, your reverence?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It is something she wishes done. She <lb/>
said she had noticed the young man who helps me, <lb/>
and that he had a good face; and did I think he <lb/>
would do a kindness for her? I said I knew you <lb/>
would, and asked her what it was, and she said a <lb/>
letter&#x2014;would you write a letter to her mother? <lb/>
And I said you would. But I said I would do it <lb/>
myself, and gladly; but she said no, that my labors <lb/>
were heavy, and she thought the young man would <lb/>
not mind the doing of this service for one not able <lb/>
to do it for herself, she not knowing how to write. <lb/>
Then I would have sent for you, and at that the <lb/>
sadness vanished out of her face. Why, it was as if <lb/>
she was going to see a friend, poor friendless thing. <lb/>
But I was not permitted. I did my best, but the <lb/>
orders remain as strict as ever, the doors are closed <lb/>
against all but officials; as before, none but officials <lb/>
may speak to her. So I went back and told her, <lb/>
and she sighed, and was sad again. Now this is <lb/>
what she begs you to write to her mother. It is <lb/>
partly a strange message, and to me means nothing, <lb/>
but she said her mother would understand. You <lb/>
will 'convey her adoring love to her family and her <lb/>
village friends, and say there will be no rescue, for <lb/>
<pb n="297"/>
that this night&#x2014;and it is the third time in the <lb/>
twelve-month, and is final&#x2014;she has seen The Vision <lb/>
of the Tree.'"</p>
<p>"How strange!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it <i>is</i> strange, but that is what she said; <lb/>
and said her parents would understand. And for a <lb/>
little time she was lost in dreams and thinkings, and <lb/>
her lips moved, and I caught in her muttering these <lb/>
lines, which she said over two or three times, and <lb/>
they seemed to bring peace and contentment to her. <lb/>
I set them down, thinking they might have some <lb/>
connection with her letter and be useful; but it was <lb/>
not so; they were a mere memory, floating idly in <lb/>
a tired mind, and they have no meaning, at least no <lb/>
relevancy."</p>
<p>I took the piece of paper, and found what I knew <lb/>
I should find:
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And when in exile wand'ring, we</l>
<l>Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,</l>
<l rend="indent">Oh, rise upon our sight!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>There was no hope any more. I knew it now. I <lb/>
knew that Joan's letter was a message to No&#x00EB;l and <lb/>
me, as well as to her family, and that its object was <lb/>
to banish vain hopes from our minds and tell us <lb/>
from her own mouth of the blow that was going to <lb/>
fall upon us, so that we, being her soldiers, would <lb/>
know it for a command to bear it as became us and <lb/>
her, and so submit to the will of God; and in thus <lb/>
obeying, find assuagement of our grief. It was like <lb/>
her, for she was always thinking of others, not of <lb/>
<pb n="298"/>
herself. Yes, her heart was sore for us; she could <lb/>
find time to think of us, the humblest of her ser- <lb/>
vants, and try to soften our pain, lighten the burden <lb/>
of our troubles,&#x2014;she that was drinking of the bitter <lb/>
waters; she that was walking in the Valley of the <lb/>
Shadow of Death.</p>
<p>I wrote the letter. You will know what it cost <lb/>
me, without my telling you. I wrote it with the <lb/>
same wooden stylus which had put upon parchment <lb/>
the first words ever dictated by Joan of Arc&#x2014;that <lb/>
high summons to the English to vacate France, two <lb/>
years past, when she was a lass of seventeen; it had <lb/>
now set down the last ones which she was ever to <lb/>
dictate. Then I broke it. For the pen that had <lb/>
served Joan of Arc could not serve any that would <lb/>
come after her in this earth without abasement.</p>
<p>The next day, May 29th, Cauchon summoned his <lb/>
serfs, and forty-two responded. It is charitable to <lb/>
believe that the other twenty were ashamed to come. <lb/>
The forty-two pronounced her a relapsed heretic, <lb/>
and condemned her to be delivered over to the <lb/>
secular arm. Cauchon thanked them. Then he <lb/>
sent orders that Joan be conveyed the next morning <lb/>
to the place known as the Old Market; and that she <lb/>
be then delivered to the civil judge, and by the civil <lb/>
judge to the executioner. That meant that she <lb/>
would be burnt.</p>
<p>All the afternoon and evening of Tuesday, the <lb/>
29th, the news was flying, and the people of the <lb/>
country-side flocking to Rouen to see the tragedy&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="299"/>
all, at least, who could prove their English sympa- <lb/>
thies and count upon admission. The press grew <lb/>
thicker and thicker in the streets, the excitement <lb/>
grew higher and higher. And now a thing was <lb/>
noticeable again which had been noticeable more <lb/>
than once before&#x2014;that there was pity for Joan in <lb/>
the hearts of many of these people. Whenever she <lb/>
had been in great danger it had manifested itself, <lb/>
and now it was apparent again&#x2014;manifest in a <lb/>
pathetic dumb sorrow which was visible in many <lb/>
faces.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Wednesday, Martin Lad- <lb/>
venu and another friar were sent to Joan to prepare <lb/>
her for death; and Manchon and I went with them <lb/>
&#x2014;a hard service for me. We tramped through the <lb/>
dim corridors, winding this way and that, and pierc- <lb/>
ing ever deeper and deeper into that vast heart of <lb/>
stone, and at last we stood before Joan. But she <lb/>
did not know it. She sat with her hands in her lap <lb/>
and her head bowed, thinking, and her face was <lb/>
very sad. One might not know what she was think- <lb/>
ing of. Of her home, and the peaceful pastures, and <lb/>
the friends she was no more to see? Of her wrongs, <lb/>
and her forsaken estate, and the cruelties which had <lb/>
been put upon her? Or was it of death&#x2014;the death <lb/>
which she had longed for, and which was now so <lb/>
close? Or was it of the <i>kind</i> of death she must <lb/>
suffer? I hoped not; for she feared only one kind, <lb/>
and that one had for her unspeakable terrors. I <lb/>
believed she so feared that one that with her strong <lb/>
<pb n="300"/>
will she would shut the thought of it wholly out of <lb/>
her mind, and hope and believe that God would take <lb/>
pity on her and grant her an easier one; and so it <lb/>
might chance that the awful news which we were <lb/>
bringing might come as a surprise to her at last.</p>
<p>We stood silent awhile, but she was still uncon- <lb/>
scious of us, still deep in her sad musings and far <lb/>
away. Then Martin Ladvenu said, softly:</p>
<p>"Joan."</p>
<p>She looked up then, with a little start, and a wan <lb/>
smile, and said:</p>
<p>"Speak. Have you a message for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my poor child. Try to bear it. Do you <lb/>
think you can bear it?"</p>
<p>"Yes"&#x2014;very softly, and her head drooped <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>"I am come to prepare you for death."</p>
<p>A faint shiver trembled through her wasted body. <lb/>
There was a pause. In the stillness we could hear <lb/>
our breathings. Then she said, still in that low <lb/>
voice:</p>
<p>"When will it be?"</p>
<p>The muffled notes of a tolling bell floated to our <lb/>
ears out of the distance.</p>
<p>"Now. The time is at hand."</p>
<p>That slight shiver passed again.</p>
<p>"It is so soon&#x2014;ah, it is so soon!"</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The distant throbbings <lb/>
of the bell pulsed through it, and we stood motion- <lb/>
less and listening. But it was broken at last.</p>
<pb n="301"/>
<p>"What death is it?"</p>
<p>"By fire!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I knew it, I knew it!" She sprang wildly <lb/>
to her feet, and wound her hands in her hair, and <lb/>
began to writhe and sob, oh, so piteously, and <lb/>
mourn and grieve and lament, and turn to first one <lb/>
and then another of us, and search our faces be- <lb/>
seechingly, as hoping she might find help and friend- <lb/>
liness there, poor thing&#x2014;she that had never denied <lb/>
these to any creature, even her wounded enemy on <lb/>
the battle-field.</p>
<p>"Oh, cruel, cruel, to treat me so! And must my <lb/>
body, that has never been defiled, be consumed to- <lb/>
day and turned to ashes? Ah, sooner would I that <lb/>
my head were cut off seven times than suffer this <lb/>
woful death. I had the promise of the Church's <lb/>
prison when I submitted, and if I had but been <lb/>
there, and not left here in the hands of my enemies, <lb/>
this miserable fate had not befallen me. Oh, I <lb/>
appeal to God the Great Judge, against the injustice <lb/>
which has been done me."</p>
<p>There was none there that could endure it. They <lb/>
turned away, with the tears running down their <lb/>
faces. In a moment I was on my knees at her feet. <lb/>
At once she thought only of my danger, and bent <lb/>
and whispered in my ear: "Up!&#x2014;do not peril <lb/>
yourself, good heart. There&#x2014;God bless you al- <lb/>
ways!" and I felt the quick clasp of her hand. <lb/>
Mine was the last hand she touched with hers in life. <lb/>
None saw it; history does not know of it or tell of <lb/>
<pb n="302"/>
it, yet it is true, just as I have told it. The next <lb/>
moment she saw Cauchon coming, and she went and <lb/>
stood before him and reproached him, saying:</p>
<p>"Bishop, it is by you that I die!"</p>
<p>He was not shamed, not touched; but said, <lb/>
smoothly:</p>
<p>"Ah, be patient, Joan. You die because you <lb/>
have not kept your promise, but have returned to <lb/>
your sins."</p>
<p>"Alas," she said, "if you had put me in the <lb/>
Church's prison, and given me right and proper <lb/>
keepers, as you promised, this would not have hap- <lb/>
pened. And for this I summon you to answer be- <lb/>
fore God!"</p>
<p>Then Cauchon winced, and looked less placidly <lb/>
content than before, and he turned him about and <lb/>
went away.</p>
<p>Joan stood awhile musing. She grew calmer, but <lb/>
occasionally she wiped her eyes, and now and then <lb/>
sobs shook her body; but their violence was modi- <lb/>
fying now, and the intervals between them were <lb/>
growing longer. Finally she looked up and saw <lb/>
Pierre Maurice, who had come in with the Bishop, <lb/>
and she said to him:</p>
<p>"Master Peter, where shall I be this night?"</p>
<p>"Have you not good hope in God?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;and by His grace I shall be in Paradise."</p>
<p>Now Martin Ladvenu heard her in confession; <lb/>
then she begged for the sacrament. But how grant <lb/>
the communion to one who had been publicly cut <lb/>
<pb n="303"/>
off from the Church, and was now no more entitled <lb/>
to its privileges than an unbaptized pagan? The <lb/>
brother could not do this, but he sent to Cauchon <lb/>
to inquire what he must do. All laws, human <lb/>
and divine, were alike to that man&#x2014;he respected <lb/>
none of them. He sent back orders to grant Joan <lb/>
whatever she wished. Her last speech to him had <lb/>
reached his fears, perhaps; it could not reach his <lb/>
heart, for he had none.</p>
<p>The Eucharist was brought now to that poor soul <lb/>
that had yearned for it with such unutterable long- <lb/>
ing all these desolate months. It was a solemn <lb/>
moment. While we had been in the deeps of the <lb/>
prison, the public courts of the castle had been fill- <lb/>
ing up with crowds of the humbler sort of men and <lb/>
women, who had learned what was going on in <lb/>
Joan's cell, and had come with softened hearts to <lb/>
do&#x2014;they knew not what; to hear&#x2014;they knew not <lb/>
what. We knew nothing of this, for they were out <lb/>
of our view. And there were other great crowds of <lb/>
the like caste gathered in masses outside the <lb/>
castle gates. And when the lights and the other <lb/>
accompaniments of the Sacrament passed by, coming <lb/>
to Joan in the prison, all those multitudes kneeled <lb/>
down and began to pray for her, and many wept; <lb/>
and when the solemn ceremony of the communion <lb/>
began in Joan's cell, out of the distance a moving <lb/>
sound was borne moaning to our ears&#x2014;it was those <lb/>
invisible multitudes chanting the litany for a depart- <lb/>
ing soul.</p>
<pb n="304"/>
<p>The fear of the fiery death was gone from Joan of <lb/>
Arc now, to come again no more, except for one <lb/>
fleeting instant&#x2014;then it would pass, and serenity <lb/>
and courage would take its place and abide till the <lb/>
end.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXIV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>At</smcap> nine o'clock the Maid of Orleans, Deliverer of <lb/>
France, went forth in the grace of her inno- <lb/>
cence and her youth to lay down her life for the <lb/>
country she loved with such devotion, and for the <lb/>
King that had abandoned her. She sat in the cart <lb/>
that is used only for felons. In one respect she was <lb/>
treated worse than a felon; for whereas she was on <lb/>
her way to be sentenced by the civil arm, she already <lb/>
bore her judgment inscribed in advance upon a <lb/>
miter-shaped cap which she wore:
<q><i>HERETIC, RELAPSED, APOSTATE, IDOLATER</i>.</q></p>
<p>In the cart with her sat the friar Martin Ladvenu <lb/>
and Ma&#x00EE;tre Jean Massieu. She looked girlishly fair <lb/>
and sweet and saintly in her long white robe, and <lb/>
when a gush of sunlight flooded her as she emerged <lb/>
from the gloom of the prison and was yet for a <lb/>
moment still framed in the arch of the somber gate, <lb/>
the massed multitudes of poor folk murmured "A <lb/>
vision! a vision!" and sank to their knees praying, <lb/>
and many of the women weeping; and the moving <lb/>
invocation for the dying rose again, and was taken <lb/>
up and borne along, a majestic wave of sound, which <lb/>
<pb n="306"/>
accompanied the doomed, solacing and blessing her, <lb/>
all the sorrowful way to the place of death. "Christ <lb/>
have pity! Saint Margaret have pity! Pray for <lb/>
her, all ye saints, archangels, and blessed martyrs, <lb/>
pray for her! Saints and angels intercede for her! <lb/>
From thy wrath, good Lord, deliver her! O Lord <lb/>
God, save her! Have mercy on her, we beseech <lb/>
Thee, good Lord!"</p>
<p>It is just and true what one of the histories has <lb/>
said: "The poor and the helpless had nothing but <lb/>
their prayers to give Joan of Arc; but these we may <lb/>
believe were not unavailing. There are few more <lb/>
pathetic events recorded in history than this weep- <lb/>
ing, helpless, praying crowd, holding their lighted <lb/>
candles and kneeling on the pavement beneath the <lb/>
prison walls of the old fortress."</p>
<p>And it was so all the way: thousands upon thou- <lb/>
sands massed upon their knees and stretching far <lb/>
down the distances, thick-sown with the faint yellow <lb/>
candle-flames, like a field starred with golden flowers.</p>
<p>But there were some that did not kneel; these <lb/>
were the English soldiers. They stood elbow to <lb/>
elbow, on each side of Joan's road, and walled it in <lb/>
all the way; and behind these living walls knelt the <lb/>
multitudes.</p>
<p>By and by a frantic man in priest's garb came <lb/>
wailing and lamenting, and tore through the crowd <lb/>
and the barrier of soldiers and flung himself on his <lb/>
knees by Joan's cart and put up his hands in suppli- <lb/>
cation, crying out:</p>
<pb n="307"/>
<p>"O forgive, forgive!"</p>
<p>It was Loyseleur!</p>
<p>And Joan forgave him; forgave him out of a <lb/>
heart that knew nothing but forgiveness, nothing <lb/>
but compassion, nothing but pity for all that suffer, <lb/>
let their offense be what it might. And she had no <lb/>
word of reproach for this poor wretch who had <lb/>
wrought day and night with deceits and treacheries <lb/>
and hypocrisies to betray her to her death.</p>
<p>The soldiers would have killed him, but the Earl <lb/>
of Warwick saved his life. What became of him is <lb/>
not known. He hid himself from the world some- <lb/>
where, to endure his remorse as he might.</p>
<p>In the square of the Old Market stood the two <lb/>
platforms and the stake that had stood before in the <lb/>
churchyard of St. Ouen. The platforms were occu- <lb/>
pied as before, the one by Joan and her judges, the <lb/>
other by great dignitaries, the principal being Cau- <lb/>
chon and the English Cardinal&#x2014;Winchester. The <lb/>
square was packed with people, the windows and <lb/>
roofs of the blocks of buildings surrounding it were <lb/>
black with them.</p>
<p>When the preparations had been finished, all noise <lb/>
and movement gradually ceased, and a waiting still- <lb/>
ness followed which was solemn and impressive.</p>
<p>And now, by order of Cauchon, an ecclesiastic <lb/>
named Nicholas Midi preached a sermon, wherein <lb/>
he explained that when a branch of the vine&#x2014; <lb/>
which is the Church&#x2014;becomes diseased and cor- <lb/>
rupt, it must be cut away or it will corrupt and de- <lb/>
<pb n="308"/>
stroy the whole vine. He made it appear that Joan, <lb/>
through her wickedness, was a menace and a peril <lb/>
to the Church's purity and holiness, and her death <lb/>
therefore necessary. When he was come to the end <lb/>
of his discourse he turned toward her and paused a <lb/>
moment, then he said:</p>
<p>"Joan, the Church can no longer protect you. <lb/>
Go in peace!'</p>
<p>Joan had been placed wholly apart and conspicu- <lb/>
ous, to signify the Church's abandonment of her, <lb/>
and she sat there in her loneliness, waiting in <lb/>
patience and resignation for the end. Cauchon <lb/>
addressed her now. He had been advised to read <lb/>
the form of her abjuration to her, and had brought <lb/>
it with him; but he changed his mind, fearing that <lb/>
she would proclaim the truth&#x2014;that she had never <lb/>
knowingly abjured&#x2014;and so bring shame upon him <lb/>
and eternal infamy. He contented himself with ad- <lb/>
monishing her to keep in mind her wickednesses, <lb/>
and repent of them, and think of her salvation. <lb/>
Then he solemnly pronounced her excommunicate <lb/>
and cut off from the body of the Church. With a <lb/>
final word he delivered her over to the secular arm <lb/>
for judgment and sentence.</p>
<p>Joan, weeping, knelt and began to pray. For <lb/>
whom? Herself? Oh, no&#x2014;for the King of France. <lb/>
Her voice rose sweet and clear, and penetrated all <lb/>
hearts with its passionate pathos. She never thought <lb/>
of his treacheries to her, she never thought of his <lb/>
desertion of her, she never remembered that it was <lb/>
<pb n="309"/>
because he was an ingrate that she was here to die a <lb/>
miserable death; she remembered only that he was <lb/>
her King, that she was his loyal and loving subject, <lb/>
and that his enemies had undermined his cause with <lb/>
evil reports and false charges, and he not by to <lb/>
defend himself. And so, in the very presence of <lb/>
death, she forgot her own troubles to implore all in <lb/>
her hearing to be just to him; to believe that he was <lb/>
good and noble and sincere, and not in any way to <lb/>
blame for any acts of hers, neither advising them <lb/>
nor urging them, but being wholly clear and free <lb/>
of all responsibility for them. Then, closing, she <lb/>
begged in humble and touching words that all here <lb/>
present would pray for her and would pardon her, <lb/>
both her enemies and such as might look friendly <lb/>
upon her and feel pity for her in their hearts.</p>
<p>There was hardly one heart there that was not <lb/>
touched&#x2014;even the English, even the judges showed <lb/>
it, and there was many a lip that trembled and many <lb/>
an eye that was blurred with tears; yes, even the <lb/>
English Cardinal's&#x2014;that man with a political heart <lb/>
of stone but a human heart of flesh.</p>
<p>The secular judge who should have delivered <lb/>
judgment and pronounced sentence was himself so <lb/>
disturbed that he forgot his duty, and Joan went to <lb/>
her death unsentenced&#x2014;thus completing with an <lb/>
illegality what had begun illegally and had so con- <lb/>
tinued to the end. He only said&#x2014;to the guards:</p>
<p>"Take her;" and to the executioner, "Do your <lb/>
duty."</p>
<pb n="310"/>
<p>Joan asked for a cross. None was able to furnish <lb/>
one. But an English soldier broke a stick in two <lb/>
and crossed the pieces and tied them together, and <lb/>
this cross he gave her, moved to it by the good <lb/>
heart that was in him; and she kissed it and put it <lb/>
in her bosom. Then Isambard de la Pierre went to <lb/>
the church near by and brought her a consecrated <lb/>
one; and this one also she kissed, and pressed it to <lb/>
her bosom with rapture, and then kissed it again <lb/>
and again, covering it with tears and pouring out <lb/>
her gratitude to God and the saints.</p>
<p>And so, weeping, and with her cross to her lips, <lb/>
she climbed up the cruel steps to the face of the <lb/>
stake, with the friar Isambard at her side. Then <lb/>
she was helped up to the top of the pile of wood <lb/>
that was built around the lower third of the stake, <lb/>
and stood upon it with her back against the stake, and <lb/>
the world gazing up at her breathless. The exe- <lb/>
cutioner ascended to her side and wound chains <lb/>
about her slender body, and so fastened her to the <lb/>
stake. Then he descended to finish his dreadful <lb/>
office; and there she remained alone&#x2014;she that had <lb/>
had so many friends in the days when she was free, <lb/>
and had been so loved and so dear.</p>
<p>All these things I saw, albeit dimly and blurred <lb/>
with tears; but I could bear no more. I continued <lb/>
in my place, but what I shall deliver to you now I <lb/>
got by others' eyes and others' mouths. Tragic <lb/>
sounds there were that pierced my ears and wounded <lb/>
my heart as I sat there, but it is as I tell you: the <lb/>
<pb n="311"/>
latest image recorded by my eyes in that desolating <lb/>
hour was Joan of Arc with the grace of her comely <lb/>
youth still unmarred; and that image, untouched by <lb/>
time or decay, has remained with me all my days. <lb/>
Now I will go on.</p>
<p>If any thought that now, in that solemn hour <lb/>
when all transgressors repent and confess, she would <lb/>
revoke her revocation and say her great deeds had <lb/>
been evil deeds and Satan and his fiends their <lb/>
source, they erred. No such thought was in her <lb/>
blameless mind. She was not thinking of herself <lb/>
and her troubles, but of others, and of woes that <lb/>
might befall them. And so, turning her grieving <lb/>
eyes about her, where rose the towers and spires of <lb/>
that fair city, she said:</p>
<p>"Oh, Rouen, Rouen, must I die here, and must <lb/>
you be my tomb? Ah, Rouen, Rouen, I have great <lb/>
fear that you will suffer for my death."</p>
<p>A whiff of smoke swept upward past her face, <lb/>
and for one moment terror seized her and she cried <lb/>
out, "Water! Give me holy water!" but the next <lb/>
moment her fears were gone, and they came no <lb/>
more to torture her.</p>
<p>She heard the flames crackling below her, and im- <lb/>
mediately distress for a fellow-creature who was in <lb/>
danger took possession of her. It was the friar <lb/>
Isambard. She had given him her cross and begged <lb/>
him to raise it toward her face and let her eyes rest <lb/>
in hope and consolation upon it till she was entered <lb/>
into the peace of God. She made him go out from <lb/>
<pb n="312"/>
the danger of the fire. Then she was satisfied, and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Now keep it always in my sight until the end."</p>
<p>Not even yet could Cauchon, that man without <lb/>
shame, endure to let her die in peace, but went <lb/>
toward her, all black with crimes and sins as he was, <lb/>
and cried out:</p>
<p>"I am come, Joan, to exhort you for the last <lb/>
time to repent and seek the pardon of God."</p>
<p>"I die through you," she said, and these were <lb/>
the last words she spoke to any upon earth.</p>
<p>Then the pitchy smoke, shot through with red <lb/>
flashes of flame, rolled up in a thick volume and hid <lb/>
her from sight; and from the heart of this darkness <lb/>
her voice rose strong and eloquent in prayer, and <lb/>
when by moments the wind shredded somewhat of <lb/>
the smoke aside, there were veiled glimpses of an <lb/>
upturned face and moving lips. At last a mercifully <lb/>
swift tide of flame burst upward, and none saw that <lb/>
face any more nor that form, and the voice was still.</p>
<p>Yes, she was gone from us: <smcap>Joan of Arc</smcap>! What <lb/>
little words they are, to tell of a rich world made <lb/>
empty and poor!</p>

<head><b>CONCLUSION</b></head>
<p><smcap>Joan's</smcap> brother Jacques died in Domremy during <lb/>
the Great Trial at Rouen. This was according <lb/>
to the prophecy which Joan made that day in the <lb/>
pastures the time that she said the rest of us would <lb/>
go to the great wars.</p>
<p>When her poor old father heard of the martyrdom <lb/>
it broke his heart and he died.</p>
<p>The mother was granted a pension by the city of <lb/>
Orleans, and upon this she lived out her days, which <lb/>
were many. Twenty-four years after her illustrious <lb/>
child's death she traveled all the way to Paris in the <lb/>
winter time and was present at the opening of the <lb/>
discussion in the Cathedral of N&#x00F4;tre Dame which <lb/>
was the first step in the Rehabilitation. Paris was <lb/>
crowded with people, from all about France, who <lb/>
came to get sight of the venerable dame, and it was <lb/>
a touching spectacle when she moved through these <lb/>
reverend wet-eyed multitudes on her way to the <lb/>
grand honors awaiting her at the cathedral. With <lb/>
her were Jean and Pierre, no longer the light-hearted <lb/>
youths who marched with us from Vaucouleurs, but <lb/>
war-worn veterans with hair beginning to show frost.</p>
<pb n="314"/>
<p>After the martyrdom No&#x00EB;l and I went back to <lb/>
Domremy, but presently when the Constable Riche- <lb/>
mont superseded La Tremouille as the King's chief <lb/>
adviser and began the completion of Joan's great <lb/>
work, we put on our harness and returned to the <lb/>
field and fought for the King all through the wars <lb/>
and skirmishes until France was freed of the English. <lb/>
It was what Joan would have desired of us; and, <lb/>
dead or alive, her desire was law for us. All the <lb/>
survivors of the personal staff were faithful to her <lb/>
memory and fought for the King to the end. <lb/>
Mainly we were well scattered, but when Paris fell <lb/>
we happened to be together. It was a great day <lb/>
and a joyous; but it was a sad one at the same time, <lb/>
because Joan was not there to march into the cap- <lb/>
tured capital with us.</p>
<p>No&#x00EB;l and I remained always together, and I was <lb/>
by his side when death claimed him. It was in the <lb/>
last great battle of the war. In that battle fell also <lb/>
Joan's sturdy old enemy Talbot. He was eighty- <lb/>
five years old, and had spent his whole life in battle. <lb/>
A fine old lion he was, with his flowing white mane <lb/>
and his tameless spirit; yes, and his indestructible <lb/>
energy as well; for he fought as knightly and vigor- <lb/>
ous a fight that day as the best man there.</p>
<p>La Hire survived the martyrdom thirteen years; <lb/>
and always fighting, of course, for that was all he <lb/>
enjoyed in life. I did not him see in all that time, <lb/>
for we were far apart, but one was always hearing <lb/>
of him.</p>
<pb n="315"/>
<p>The Bastard of Orleans and D'Alen&#x00E7;on and <lb/>
D'Aulon lived to see France free, and to testify <lb/>
with Jean and Pierre d'Arc and Pasquerel and me <lb/>
at the Rehabilitation. But they are all at rest now, <lb/>
these many years. I alone am left of those who <lb/>
fought at the side of Joan of Arc in the great wars. <lb/>
She said I would live until these wars were forgotten <lb/>
&#x2014;a prophecy which failed. If I should live a <lb/>
thousand years it would still fail. For whatsoever <lb/>
had touch with Joan of Arc, that thing is immortal.</p>
<p>Members of Joan's family married, and they have <lb/>
left descendants. Their descendants are of the no- <lb/>
bility, but their family name and blood bring them <lb/>
honors which no other nobles receive or may hope <lb/>
for. You have seen how everybody along the way <lb/>
uncovered when those children came yesterday to <lb/>
pay their duty to me. It was not because they <lb/>
are noble, it is because they are grandchildren of <lb/>
the brothers of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>Now as to the Rehabilitation. Joan crowned the <lb/>
King at Rheims. For reward he allowed her to be <lb/>
hunted to her death without making one effort to <lb/>
save her. During the next twenty-three years he <lb/>
remained indifferent to her memory; indifferent to <lb/>
the fact that her good name was under a damning <lb/>
blot put there by the priests because of the deeds <lb/>
which she had done in saving him and his scepter; <lb/>
indifferent to the fact that France was ashamed, and <lb/>
longed to have the Deliverer's fair fame restored. <lb/>
Indifferent all that time. Then he suddenly changed <lb/>
<pb n="316"/>
and was anxious to have justice for poor Joan him- <lb/>
self. Why? Had he become grateful at last? Had <lb/>
remorse attacked his hard heart? No, he had a <lb/>
better reason&#x2014;a better one for his sort of man. <lb/>
This better reason was that, now that the English <lb/>
had been finally expelled from the country, they <lb/>
were beginning to call attention to the fact that this <lb/>
King had gotten his crown by the hands of a person <lb/>
proven by the priests to have been in league with <lb/>
Satan and burned for it by them as a sorceress&#x2014; <lb/>
therefore, of what value or authority was such a <lb/>
Kingship as that? Of no value at all; no nation <lb/>
could afford to allow such a king to remain on the <lb/>
throne.</p>
<p>It was high time to stir now, and the King did it. <lb/>
That is how Charles VII. came to be smitten with <lb/>
anxiety to have justice done the memory of his <lb/>
benefactress.</p>
<p>He appealed to the Pope, and the Pope appointed <lb/>
a great commission of churchmen to examine into <lb/>
the facts of Joan's life and award judgment. The <lb/>
Commission sat at Paris, at Domremy, at Rouen, at <lb/>
Orleans, and at several other places, and continued <lb/>
its work during several months. It examined the <lb/>
records of Joan's trials, it examined the Bastard of <lb/>
Orleans, and the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on, and D'Aulon, <lb/>
and Pasquerel, and Courcelles, and Isambard de la <lb/>
Pierre, and Manchon, and me, and many others <lb/>
whose names I have made familiar to you; also <lb/>
they examined more than a hundred witnesses whose <lb/>
<pb n="317"/>
names are less familiar to you&#x2014;friends of Joan in <lb/>
Domremy, Vaucouleurs, Orleans, and other places, <lb/>
and a number of judges and other people who had <lb/>
assisted at the Rouen trials, the abjuration, and the <lb/>
martyrdom. And out of this exhaustive examina- <lb/>
tion Joan's character and history came spotless and <lb/>
perfect, and this verdict was placed upon record, to <lb/>
remain forever.</p>
<p>I was present upon most of these occasions, and <lb/>
saw again many faces which I have not seen for a <lb/>
quarter of a century; among them some well- <lb/>
beloved faces&#x2014;those of our generals and that of <lb/>
Catherine Boucher (married, alas!), and also among <lb/>
them certain other faces that filled me with bitter- <lb/>
ness&#x2014;those of Beaupere and Courcelles and a <lb/>
number of their fellow-fiends. I saw Haumette and <lb/>
Little Mengette&#x2014;edging along toward fifty now, <lb/>
and mothers of many children. I saw No&#x00EB;l's father, <lb/>
and the parents of the Paladin and the Sunflower.</p>
<p>It was beautiful to hear the Duke d'Alen&#x00E7;on <lb/>
praise Joan's splendid capacities as a general, and to <lb/>
hear the Bastard indorse these praises with his elo- <lb/>
quent tongue and then go on and tell how sweet and <lb/>
good Joan was, and how full of pluck and fire and <lb/>
impetuosity, and mischief, and mirthfulness, and <lb/>
tenderness, and compassion, and everything that <lb/>
was pure and fine and noble and lovely. He made <lb/>
her live again before me, and wrung my heart.</p>
<p>I have finished my story of Joan of Arc, that <lb/>
wonderful child, that sublime personality, that spirit <lb/>
<pb n="318"/>
which in one regard has had no peer and will have <lb/>
none&#x2014;this: its purity from all alloy of self-seeking, <lb/>
self-interest, personal ambition. In it no trace of <lb/>
these motives can be found, search as you may, and <lb/>
this cannot be said of any other person whose name <lb/>
appears in profane history.</p>
<p>With Joan of Arc love of country was more than <lb/>
a sentiment&#x2014;it was a passion. She was the Genius <lb/>
of Patriotism&#x2014;she was Patriotism embodied, con- <lb/>
creted, made flesh, and palpable to the touch and <lb/>
visible to the eye.</p>
<p>Love, Mercy, Charity, Fortitude, War, Peace, <lb/>
Poetry, Music&#x2014;these may be symbolized as any <lb/>
shall prefer: by figures of either sex and of any <lb/>
age; but a slender girl in her first young bloom, <lb/>
with the martyr's crown upon her head, and in her <lb/>
hand the sword that severed her country's bonds&#x2014; <lb/>
shall not this, and no other, stand for <smcap>Patriotism</smcap> <lb/>
through all the ages until time shall end?</p>
