<head><b>THE WEATHER IN THIS BOOK</b></head>
<p><smcap>No</smcap> weather will be found in this book. This is an <lb/>
attempt to pull a book through without weather. It <lb/>
being the first attempt of the kind in fictitious litera- <lb/>
ture, it may prove a failure, but it seemed worth the <lb/>
while of some dare-devil person to try it, and the <lb/>
author was in just the mood.</p>
<p>Many a reader who wanted to read a tale through was <lb/>
not able to do it because of delays on account of the <lb/>
weather. Nothing breaks up an author's progress like <lb/>
having to stop every few pages to fuss-up the weather. <lb/>
Thus it is plain that persistent intrusions of weather are <lb/>
bad for both reader and author.</p>
<p>Of course weather is necessary to a narrative of <lb/>
human experience. That is conceded. But it ought <lb/>
to be put where it will not be in the way; where it will <lb/>
not interrupt the flow of the narrative. And it ought <lb/>
to be the ablest weather than can be had, not ignorant, <lb/>
poor-quality, amateur weather. Weather is a literary <lb/>
specialty, and no untrained hand can turn out a good <lb/>
article of it. The present author can do only a few <lb/>
trifling ordinary kinds of weather, and he cannot do <lb/>
those very good. So it has seemed wisest to borrow <lb/>
such weather as is necessary for the book from quali- <lb/>
fied and recognized experts&#x2014;giving credit, of course. <lb/>
This weather will be found over in the back part of the <lb/>
book, out of the way. <i>See Appendix</i>. The reader is <lb/>
requested to turn over and help himself from time to <lb/>
time as he goes along.</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> Colonel Mulberry Sellers here reintroduced to <lb/>
the public is the same person who appeared as <i>Eschol</i> <lb/>
Sellers in the first edition of the tale entitled <i>The Gilded <lb/>
Age</i>, years ago, and as <i>Beriah</i> Sellers in the subsequent <lb/>
editions of the same book, and finally as <i>Mulberry</i> <lb/>
Sellers in the drama played afterwards by John T. <lb/>
Raymond.</p>
<p>The name was changed from Eschol to Beriah to ac- <lb/>
commodate an Eschol Sellers who rose up out of the <lb/>
vasty deeps of uncharted space and preferred his re- <lb/>
quest&#x2014;backed by threat of a libel suit&#x2014;then went <lb/>
his way appeased, and came no more. In the play <lb/>
Beriah had to be dropped to satisfy another member of <lb/>
the race, and Mulberry was substituted in the hope that <lb/>
the objectors would be tired by that time and let it <lb/>
pass unchallenged. So far it has occupied the field in <lb/>
peace; therefore we chance it again, feeling reasonably <lb/>
safe, this time, under shelter of the statute of limita- <lb/>

<div2 type="chapter" n="I">
<head><b>CHAPTER I.</b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> is a matchless morning in rural England. On a <lb/>
fair hill we see a majestic pile, the ivied walls and <lb/>
towers of Cholmondeley Castle, huge relic and witness <lb/>
of the baronial grandeurs of the Middle Ages. This is <lb/>
one of the seats of the Earl of Rossmore, K.G., G.C. <lb/>
B., K.C.M.G., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., who pos- <lb/>
sesses twenty-two thousand acres of English land, owns <lb/>
a parish in London with two thousand houses on its <lb/>
lease-roll, and struggles comfortably along on an in- <lb/>
come of two hundred thousand pounds a year. The <lb/>
father and founder of this proud old line was William <lb/>
the Conqueror his very self; the mother of it was not <lb/>
inventoried in history by name, she being merely a <lb/>
random episode and inconsequential, like the tanner's <lb/>
daughter of Falaise.</p>
<p>In a breakfast-room of the castle on this breezy fine <lb/>
morning there are two persons and the cooling remains <lb/>
of a deserted meal. One of these persons is the old <lb/>
lord, tall, erect, square-shouldered, white-haired, stern- <lb/>
browed, a man who shows character in every feature, <lb/>
attitude, and movement, and carries his seventy years <lb/>
as easily as most men carry fifty. The other person is <lb/>
his only son and heir, a dreamy-eyed young fellow, <lb/>
who looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty. <lb/>
Candor, kindliness, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, mod- <lb/>
<pb n="10"/>
esty&#x2014;it is easy to see that these are cardinal traits of <lb/>
his character; and so when you have clothed him in <lb/>
the formidable components of his name, you somehow <lb/>
seem to be contemplating a lamb in armor; his name <lb/>
and style being the Honorable Kirkcudbright Llanover <lb/>
Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley of Cholmonde- <lb/>
ley Castle, Warwickshire. (Pronounced K'koobry <lb/>
Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount Barkly of <lb/>
Chumly Castle, Warrikshr.) He is standing by a great <lb/>
window, in an attitude suggestive of respectful atten- <lb/>
tion to what his father is saying and equally respectful <lb/>
dissent from the positions and arguments offered. The <lb/>
father walks the floor as he talks, and his talk shows <lb/>
that his temper is away up towards summer heat.</p>
<p>"Soft-spirited as you are, Berkeley, I am quite <lb/>
aware that when you have once made up your mind to <lb/>
do a thing which your ideas of honor and justice re- <lb/>
quire you to do, argument and reason are (for the <lb/>
time being) wasted upon you&#x2014;yes, and ridicule, per- <lb/>
suasion, supplication, and command as well. To my <lb/>
mind&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Father, if you will look at it without prejudice, <lb/>
without passion, you must concede that I am not doing <lb/>
a rash thing, a thoughtless, willful thing, with nothing <lb/>
substantial behind it to justify it. <i>I</i> did not create the <lb/>
American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore; I did <lb/>
not hunt for him, did not find him, did not obtrude <lb/>
him upon your notice. He found himself, he injected <lb/>
himself into our lives&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And has made mine a purgatory for ten years <lb/>
with his tiresome letters, his wordy reasonings, his <lb/>
acres of tedious evidence&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Which you would never read, would never consent <lb/>
to read. Yet in common fairness he was entitled to a <lb/>
hearing. That hearing would either prove he was the <lb/>
rightful earl&#x2014;in which case our course would be plain <lb/>
<pb n="11"/>
&#x2014;or it would prove that he wasn't&#x2014;in which case <lb/>
our course would be equally plain. I have read his <lb/>
evidences, my lord. I have conned them well, studied <lb/>
them patiently and thoroughly. The chain seems to <lb/>
be complete, no important link wanting. I believe he <lb/>
is the rightful earl."</p>
<p>"And I a usurper&#x2014;a nameless pauper, a tramp! <lb/>
Consider what you are saying, sir."</p>
<p>"Father, <i>if</i> he is the rightful earl, would you, could <lb/>
you&#x2014;that fact being established&#x2014;consent to keep <lb/>
his titles and his properties from him a day, an hour, <lb/>
a minute?"</p>
<p>"You are talking nonsense&#x2014;nonsense&#x2014;lurid <lb/>
idiocy! Now listen to me. I will make a confession <lb/>
&#x2014;if you wish to call it by that name. I did not read <lb/>
those evidences because I had no occasion to&#x2014;I was <lb/>
made familiar with them in the time of this claimant's <lb/>
father and of my own father forty years ago. This <lb/>
fellow's predecessors have kept mine more or less <lb/>
familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty <lb/>
years. The truth is, the rightful heir did go to <lb/>
America, with the Fairfax heir or about the same <lb/>
time&#x2014;but disappeared somewhere in the wilds of <lb/>
Virginia, got married, and began to breed savages for <lb/>
the Claimant market; wrote no letters home; was sup- <lb/>
posed to be dead; his younger brother softly took <lb/>
possession; presently the American did die, and <lb/>
straightway his eldest product put in his claim&#x2014;by <lb/>
letter&#x2014;letter still in existence&#x2014;and died before the <lb/>
uncle in possession found time&#x2014;or maybe inclination <lb/>
&#x2014;to answer. The infant son of that eldest product <lb/>
grew up&#x2014;long interval, you see&#x2014;and <i>he</i> took to <lb/>
writing letters and furnishing evidences. Well, suc- <lb/>
cessor after successor has done the same, down to the <lb/>
present idiot. It was a succession of paupers; not <lb/>
one of them was ever able to pay his passage to Eng- <lb/>
<pb n="12"/>
land or institute suit. The Fairfaxes kept their lord- <lb/>
ship alive, and so they have never lost it to this day, <lb/>
although they live in Maryland; their friend lost his <lb/>
by his own neglect. You perceive now that the facts <lb/>
in this case bring us to precisely this result: morally <lb/>
the American tramp <i>is</i> rightful earl of Rossmore; <lb/>
legally he has no more right than his dog. There <lb/>
now&#x2014;are you satisfied?"</p>
<p>There was a pause; then the son glanced at the <lb/>
crest carved in the great oaken mantel, and said, with <lb/>
a regretful note in his voice:</p>
<p>"Since the introduction of heraldic symbols, the <lb/>
motto of this house has been <i>Suum cuique</i>&#x2014;to every <lb/>
man his own. By your own intrepidly frank con- <lb/>
fession, my lord, it is become a sarcasm. If Simon <lb/>
Lathers&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Keep that exasperating name to yourself! For <lb/>
ten years it has pestered my eye and tortured my ear; <lb/>
till at last my very footfalls time themselves to the <lb/>
brain-racking rhythm of <i>Simon Lathers!</i>&#x2014;<i>Simon <lb/>
Lathers!</i>&#x2014;<i>Simon Lathers!</i> And now, to make its <lb/>
presence in my soul eternal, immortal, imperishable, <lb/>
you have resolved to&#x2014;to&#x2014;what is it you have re- <lb/>
solved to do?"</p>
<p>"To go to Simon Lathers in America and change <lb/>
places with him."</p>
<p>"What? Deliver the reversion of the earldom into <lb/>
his hands?"</p>
<p>"That is my purpose."</p>
<p>"Make this tremendous surrender without even try- <lb/>
ing the fantastic case in the Lords?"</p>
<p>"Ye&#x2014;s&#x2014;" with hesitation and some embarrass- <lb/>
ment.</p>
<p>"By all that is amazing, I believe you are insane, <lb/>
my son. See here&#x2014;have you been training with that <lb/>
ass again&#x2014;that radical, if you prefer the term, though <lb/>
<pb n="13"/>
the words are synonymous&#x2014;Lord Tanzy of Toll- <lb/>
mache?"</p>
<p>The son did not reply, and the old lord continued:</p>
<p>"Yes, you confess. That puppy, that shame to his <lb/>
birth and caste, who holds all hereditary lordships and <lb/>
privilege to be usurpation, all nobility a tinsel sham, <lb/>
all aristocratic institutions a fraud, all inequalities in <lb/>
rank a legalized crime and an infamy, and no bread <lb/>
honest bread that a man doesn't earn by his own work <lb/>
&#x2014;<i>work</i>, pah!"&#x2014;and the old patrician brushed im- <lb/>
aginary labor-dirt from his white hands. "You have <lb/>
come to hold just those opinions yourself, I suppose," <lb/>
he added, with a sneer.</p>
<p>A faint flush in the young man's cheek told that the <lb/>
shot had hit and hurt, but he answered with dignity:</p>
<p>"I have. I say it without shame&#x2014;I feel none. <lb/>
And now my reason for resolving to renounce my <lb/>
heirship without resistance is explained. I wish to <lb/>
retire from what to me is a false existence, a false <lb/>
position, and begin my life over again&#x2014;begin it right <lb/>
&#x2014;begin it on the level of mere manhood, unassisted <lb/>
by factitious aids, and succeed or fail by pure merit or <lb/>
the want of it. I will go to America, where all men <lb/>
are equal and all have an equal chance; I will live or die, <lb/>
sink or swim, win or lose as just a man&#x2014;that alone, <lb/>
and not a single helping gaud or fiction back of it."</p>
<p>"Hear, hear!" The two men looked each other <lb/>
steadily in the eye a moment or two; then the elder <lb/>
one added, musingly, "Ab-so-lutely cra-zy&#x2014;ab-so- <lb/>
lutely!" After another silence, he said, as one who, <lb/>
long troubled by clouds, detects a ray of sunshine, <lb/>
"Well, there will be one satisfaction&#x2014;Simon Lathers <lb/>
will come here to enter into his own, and I will drown <lb/>
him in the horse-pond. The poor devil&#x2014;always so <lb/>
humble in his letters, so pitiful, so deferential; so <lb/>
steeped in reverence for our great line and lofty <lb/>
<pb n="14"/>
station; so anxious to placate us, so prayerful for <lb/>
recognition as a relative, a bearer in his veins of our <lb/>
sacred blood&#x2014;and withal so poor, so needy, so <lb/>
threadbare and pauper-shod as to raiment, so despised, <lb/>
so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the lewd <lb/>
American scum around him&#x2014;ach, the vulgar, crawl- <lb/>
ing, insufferable tramp! To read one of his cringing, <lb/>
nauseating letters&#x2014;Well?"</p>
<p>This to a splendid flunky, all in inflamed plush and <lb/>
buttons and knee-breeches as to his trunk, and a glint- <lb/>
ing white frost-work of ground-glass paste as to his <lb/>
head, who stood with his heels together and the upper <lb/>
half of him bent forward, a salver in his hands.</p>
<p>"The letters, my lord."</p>
<p>My lord took them, and the servant disappeared.</p>
<p>"Among the rest, an American letter. From the <lb/>
tramp, of course. Jove, but here's a change! No <lb/>
brown-paper envelope this time, filched from a shop <lb/>
and carrying the shop's advertisement in the corner. <lb/>
Oh, no; a proper enough envelope&#x2014;with a most <lb/>
ostentatiously broad mourning border&#x2014;for his cat, <lb/>
perhaps, since he was a bachelor&#x2014;and fastened with <lb/>
red wax&#x2014;a batch of it as big as a half-crown&#x2014;and <lb/>
&#x2014;and&#x2014;our crest for a seal!&#x2014;motto and all. And <lb/>
the ignorant, sprawling hand is gone; he sports a <lb/>
secretary, evidently&#x2014;a secretary with a most confi- <lb/>
dent swing and flourish to his pen. Oh, indeed, our <lb/>
fortunes are improving over there&#x2014;our meek tramp <lb/>
has undergone a metamorphosis."</p>
<p>"Read it, my lord, please."</p>
<p>"Yes, this time I will. For the sake of the cat:</p>

name! <i>Mulberry</i> Sellers&#x2014;there's music for you. <lb/>
Simon Lathers&#x2014;Mulberry Sellers&#x2014;Mulberry Sellers <lb/>

<p>"If I have your leave, father."</p>
<p>The old gentleman stood musing some time after his <lb/>
son was gone. This was his thought:</p>
<p>"He is a good boy, and lovable. Let him take his <lb/>
own course&#x2014;as it would profit nothing to oppose him <lb/>
&#x2014;make things worse, in fact. My arguments and his <lb/>
aunt's persuasions have failed; let us see what America <lb/>
can do for him; let us see what equality and hard <lb/>
times can effect for the mental health of a brain-sick <lb/>
young British lord. Going to renounce his lordship <lb/>
and be a man! Yas!"</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER II.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Colonel Mulberry Sellers</smcap>&#x2014;this was some <lb/>
days before he wrote his letter to Lord Rossmore <lb/>
&#x2014;was seated in his "library," which was also his <lb/>
"drawing-room" and was also his "picture-gallery" <lb/>
and likewise his "workshop." Sometimes he called <lb/>
it by one of these names, sometimes by another, ac- <lb/>
cording to occasion and circumstance. He was con- <lb/>
structing what seemed to be some kind of a frail <lb/>
mechanical toy, and was apparently very much inter- <lb/>
ested in his work. He was a white-headed man now, <lb/>
but otherwise he was as young, alert, buoyant, vision- <lb/>
ary, and enterprising as ever. His loving old wife sat <lb/>
near by, contentedly knitting and thinking, with a cat <lb/>
asleep in her lap. The room was large, light, and had <lb/>
a comfortable look, in fact, a homelike look, though <lb/>
the furniture was of a humble sort and not over- <lb/>
abundant, and the knickknacks and things that go to <lb/>
adorn a living-room not plenty and not costly. But <lb/>
there were natural flowers, and there was an abstract <lb/>
and unclassifiable something about the place which be- <lb/>
trayed the presence in the house of somebody with a <lb/>
happy taste and an effective touch.</p>
<p>Even the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow <lb/>
without offense; in fact, they seemed to belong there <lb/>
and to add an attraction to the room&#x2014;a fascination, <lb/>
anyway; for whoever got his eye on one of them was <lb/>
like to gaze and suffer till he died&#x2014;you have seen <lb/>
<pb n="18"/>
that kind of pictures. Some of these terrors were <lb/>
landscapes, and some libeled the sea, some were osten- <lb/>
sible portraits, all were crimes. All the portraits were <lb/>
recognizable as dead Americans of distinction, and <lb/>
yet, through labeling added by a daring hand, they <lb/>
were all doing duty here as "Earls of Rossmore." <lb/>
The newest one had left the works as Andrew Jackson, <lb/>
but was doing its best now as "Simon Lathers Lord <lb/>
Rossmore, Present Earl." On one wall was a cheap <lb/>
old railroad map of Warwickshire. This had been <lb/>
newly labeled "The Rossmore Estates." On the op- <lb/>
posite wall was another map, and this was the most im- <lb/>
posing decoration of the establishment and the first to <lb/>
catch a stranger's attention, because of its great size. <lb/>
It had once borne simply the title <smcap>Siberia</smcap>: but now <lb/>
the word "<smcap>Future</smcap>" had been written in front of that <lb/>
word. There were other additions in red ink&#x2014;many <lb/>
cities, with great populations set down, scattered over <lb/>
the vast country at points where neither cities nor <lb/>
populations exist to-day. One of these cities, with <lb/>
population placed at 1,500,000, bore the name <lb/>
"Libertyorloffskoizalinski," and there was a still more <lb/>
populous one, centrally located and marked "Capital," <lb/>
which bore the name "Freedomolovnaivanovich."</p>
<p>The "mansion"&#x2014;the Colonel's usual name for the <lb/>
house&#x2014;was a rickety old two-story frame of consider- <lb/>
able size, which had been painted, some time or other, <lb/>
but had nearly forgotten it. It was away out in the <lb/>
ragged edge of Washington, and had once been some- <lb/>
body's country place. It had a neglected yard around <lb/>
it, with a paling fence that needed straightening up in <lb/>
places, and a gate that would stay shut. By the door- <lb/>
post were several modest tin signs. "Col. Mulberry <lb/>
Sellers, Attorney at Law and Claim Agent," was the <lb/>
principal one. One learned from the others that the <lb/>
Colonel was a Materializer, a Hypnotizer, a Mind-Cure <lb/>
<pb n="19"/>
dabbler, and so on. For he was a man who could <lb/>
always find things to do.</p>
<p>A white-headed negro man, with spectacles and <lb/>
damaged white-cotton gloves, appeared in the presence, <lb/>
made a stately obeisance, and announced:</p>
<p>"Marse Washington Hawkins, suh."</p>
<p>"Great Scott! Show him in Dan'l, show him in."</p>
<p>The Colonel and his wife were on their feet in a mo- <lb/>
ment, and the next moment were joyfully wringing the <lb/>
hands of a stoutish, discouraged-looking man whose <lb/>
general aspect suggested that he was fifty years old, <lb/>
but whose hair swore to a hundred.</p>
<p>"Well, well, well, Washington, my boy, it <i>is</i> good <lb/>
to look at you again. Sit down, sit down, and make <lb/>
yourself at home. There, now&#x2014;why, you look per- <lb/>
fectly natural; aging a little, just a little, but you'd <lb/>
have known him anywhere, wouldn't you, Polly?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, Berry, he's <i>just</i> like his pa would have <lb/>
looked if he'd lived. Dear, dear, where have you <lb/>
dropped from? Let me see, how long is it since&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I should say it's all of fifteen years, Mrs. Sellers."</p>
<p>"Well, well, how time does get away with us. Yes, <lb/>
and oh, the changes that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>There was a sudden catch of her voice and a trem- <lb/>
bling of the lip, the men waiting reverently for her to <lb/>
get command of herself and go on; but after a little <lb/>
struggle she turned away, with her apron to her eyes, <lb/>
and softly disappeared.</p>
<p>"Seeing you made her think of the children, poor <lb/>
thing&#x2014;dear, dear, they're all dead but the youngest. <lb/>
But banish care, it's no time for it now&#x2014;on with the <lb/>
dance, let joy be unconfined is my motto, whether <lb/>
there's any dance to dance, or any joy to unconfine&#x2014; <lb/>
you'll be the healthier for it every time&#x2014;every time, <lb/>
Washington&#x2014;it's my experience, and I've seen a <lb/>
good deal of this world. Come&#x2014;where have you <lb/>
<pb n="20"/>
disappeared to all these years, and are you from there <lb/>
now, or where are you from?"</p>
<p>"I don't quite think you would ever guess, Colonel. <lb/>
Cherokee Strip."</p>
<p>"My land!"</p>
<p>"Sure as you live."</p>
<p>"You can't mean it. Actually <i>living</i> out there?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes, if a body may call it that; though it's <lb/>
a pretty strong term for 'dobies and jackass rabbits, <lb/>
boiled beans and slapjacks, depression, withered hopes, <lb/>
poverty in all its varieties&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Louise out there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and the children."</p>
<p>"Out there now?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I couldn't afford to bring them with me."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see; you had to come&#x2014;claim against the <lb/>
government. Make yourself perfectly easy&#x2014;I'll take <lb/>
care of that."</p>
<p>"But it isn't a claim against the government."</p>
<p>"No? Want to be postmaster? <i>That's</i> all right. <lb/>
Leave it to me. I'll fix it."</p>
<p>"But it isn't postmaster&#x2014;you're all astray yet."</p>
<p>"Well, good gracious, Washington, why don't you <lb/>
come out and tell me what it is? What do you want <lb/>
to be so reserved and distrustful with an old friend like <lb/>
me for? Don't you reckon I can keep a se&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"There's no secret about it&#x2014;you merely don't <lb/>
give me a chance to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Now look here, old friend, I know the human <lb/>
race; and I know that when a man comes to Washing- <lb/>
ton, I don't care if it's from heaven, let alone Cherokee <lb/>
Strip, it's because he <i>wants</i> something. And I know <lb/>
that as a rule he's not going to get it; that he'll stay <lb/>
and try for another thing and won't get that; the same <lb/>
luck with the next and the next and the next; and <lb/>
keeps on till he strikes bottom, and is too poor and <lb/>
<pb n="21"/>
ashamed to go back, even to Cherokee Strip; and at <lb/>
last his heart breaks and they take up a collection and <lb/>
bury him. There&#x2014;don't interrupt me, I know what <lb/>
I'm talking about. Happy and prosperous in the Far <lb/>
West, wasn't I? <i>You</i> know that. Principal citizen of <lb/>
Hawkeye, looked up to by everybody, kind of an <lb/>
autocrat&#x2014;actually a kind of an autocrat, Washington. <lb/>
Well, nothing would do but I must go Minister to St. <lb/>
James, the governor and everybody insisting, you <lb/>
know, and so at last I consented&#x2014;no getting out of <lb/>
it, <i>had</i> to do it, so here I came. <i>A day too late</i>, <lb/>
Washington. Think of that&#x2014;what little things change <lb/>
the world's history&#x2014;yes, sir, the place had been filled. <lb/>
Well, there I was, you see. I offered to compromise <lb/>
and go to Paris. The President was very sorry and all <lb/>
that, but <i>that</i> place, you see, didn't belong to the <lb/>
West, so there I was again. There was no help for it, <lb/>
so I had to stoop a little&#x2014;we all reach the day some <lb/>
time or other when we've got to do that, Washington, <lb/>
and it's not a bad thing for us, either, take it by and <lb/>
large and all around&#x2014;I had to stoop a little and offer <lb/>
to take Constantinople. Washington, consider this&#x2014; <lb/>
for it's perfectly true&#x2014;within a month I <i>asked</i> for <lb/>
China; within another month I <i>begged</i> for Japan; one <lb/>
year later I was away down, down, down, supplicating <lb/>
with tears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift <lb/>
of the Government of the United States&#x2014;Flint-Picker <lb/>
in the cellars of the War Department. And, by <lb/>
George, I didn't get it!"</p>
<p>"Flint-Picker?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Office established in the time of the Revolu- <lb/>
tion, last century. The musket-flints for the military <lb/>
posts were supplied from the capital. They do it yet; <lb/>
for although the flint-arm has gone out and the forts <lb/>
have tumbled down, the decree hasn't been repealed&#x2014; <lb/>
been overlooked and forgotten, you see&#x2014;and so the <lb/>
<pb n="22"/>
vacancies where old Ticonderoga and others used to <lb/>
stand still get their six quarts of gun-flints a year just <lb/>
the same."</p>
<p>Washington said, musingly, after a pause:</p>
<p>"How strange it seems&#x2014;to start for Minister to <lb/>
England at twenty thousand a year and fail for Flint- <lb/>
Picker at&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Three dollars a week. It's human life, Washing- <lb/>
ton&#x2014;just an epitome of human ambition, and strug- <lb/>
gle, and the outcome; you aim for the palace and get <lb/>
drowned in the sewer."</p>
<p>There was another meditative silence. Then Wash- <lb/>
ington said, with earnest compassion in his voice:</p>
<p>"And so, after coming here, against your inclina- <lb/>
tion, to satisfy your sense of patriotic duty and ap- <lb/>
pease a selfish public clamor, you get absolutely noth- <lb/>
ing for it."</p>
<p>"Nothing?" The Colonel had to get up and stand <lb/>
to get room for his amazement to expand. "<i>Nothing</i>, <lb/>
Washington? I ask you this: to be a Perpetual Mem- <lb/>
ber and the <i>only</i> Perpetual Member of a Diplomatic <lb/>
Body accredited to the greatest country on earth&#x2014;do <lb/>
you call that nothing?"</p>
<p>It was Washington's turn to be amazed. He was <lb/>
stricken dumb; but the wide-eyed wonder, the reverent <lb/>
admiration expressed in his face were more eloquent <lb/>
than any words could have been. The Colonel's <lb/>
wounded spirit was healed, and he resumed his seat <lb/>
pleased and content. He leaned forward and said, <lb/>
impressively:</p>
<p>"What was due to a man who had become forever <lb/>
conspicuous by an experience without precedent in the <lb/>
history of the world?&#x2014;a man made permanently and <lb/>
diplomatically sacred, so to speak, by having been <lb/>
connected, temporarily, through solicitation, with every <lb/>
single diplomatic post in the roster of this government, <lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
from Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary <lb/>
to the Court of St. James, all the way down to Consul <lb/>
to a guano rock in the Straits of Sunda&#x2014;salary pay- <lb/>
able in guano&#x2014;which disappeared by volcanic convul- <lb/>
sion the day before they got down to my name in the <lb/>
list of applicants. Certainly something august enough <lb/>
to be answerable to the size of this unique and memor- <lb/>
able experience was my due, and I got it. By the <lb/>
common voice of this community, by acclamation of <lb/>
the people, that mighty utterance which brushes aside <lb/>
laws and legislation, and from whose decrees there is <lb/>
no appeal, I was named Perpetual Member of the <lb/>
Diplomatic Body representing the multifarious sover- <lb/>
eignties and civilizations of the globe near the repub- <lb/>
lican court of the United States of America. And <lb/>
they brought me home with a torchlight procession."</p>
<p>"It is wonderful, Colonel, simply wonderful."</p>
<p>"It's the loftiest official position in the whole earth."</p>
<p>"I should think so&#x2014;and the most commanding."</p>
<p>"You have named the word. Think of it. I frown, <lb/>
and there is war; I smile, and contending nations lay <lb/>
down their arms."</p>
<p>"It is awful. The responsibility, I mean."</p>
<p>"It is nothing. Responsibility is no burden to me; <lb/>
I am used to it; have always been used to it."</p>
<p>"And the work&#x2014;the work! Do you have to <lb/>
attend all the sittings?"</p>
<p>"Who, I? Does the Emperor of Russia attend the <lb/>
conclaves of the governors of the provinces? He sits <lb/>
at home and indicates his pleasure."</p>
<p>Washington was silent a moment, then a deep sigh <lb/>
escaped him.</p>
<p>"How proud I was an hour ago; how paltry seems <lb/>
my little promotion now! Colonel, the reason I came <lb/>
to Washington is&#x2014;I am Congressional Delegate from <lb/>
Cherokee Strip!"</p>
<pb n="24"/>
<p>The Colonel sprang to his feet, and broke out, with <lb/>
prodigious enthusiasm:</p>
<p>"Give me your hand, my boy&#x2014;this is immense <lb/>
news! I congratulate you with all my heart. My <lb/>
prophecies stand confirmed. I always said it was in <lb/>
you. I always said you were born for high distinction <lb/>
and would achieve it. You ask Polly if I didn't."</p>
<p>Washington was dazed by this most unexpected <lb/>
demonstration.</p>
<p>"Why, Colonel, there's nothing <i>to</i> it. That little, <lb/>
narrow, desolate, unpeopled, oblong streak of grass <lb/>
and gravel, lost in the remote wastes of the vast con- <lb/>
tinent&#x2014;why, it's like representing a billiard-table&#x2014;a <lb/>
discarded one."</p>
<p>"Tut-tut, it's a great, it's a staving preferment, and <lb/>
just opulent with influence here."</p>
<p>"Shucks, Colonel, I haven't even a vote."</p>
<p>"That's nothing; you can make speeches."</p>
<p>"No, I can't. The population's only two hun- <lb/>
dred&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That's all right, that's all right&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And they hadn't any right to elect me; we're not <lb/>
even a Territory, there's no Organic Act, the govern- <lb/>
ment hasn't any official knowledge of us whatever."</p>
<p>"Never mind about that; I'll fix that. I'll rush <lb/>
the thing through; I'll get you organized in no time."</p>
<p>"<i>Will</i> you, Colonel?&#x2014;it's <i>too</i> good of you; but <lb/>
it's just your old sterling self, the same old ever-faithful <lb/>
friend," and the grateful tears welled up in Washing- <lb/>
ton's eyes.</p>
<p>"It's just as good as done, my boy, just as good as <lb/>
done. Shake hands. We'll hitch teams together, you <lb/>
and I, and we'll make things hum!"</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER III.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Mrs. Sellers</smcap> returned now with her composure <lb/>
restored, and began to ask after Hawkins' wife, <lb/>
and about his children, and the number of them, and <lb/>
so on, and her examination of the witness resulted in a <lb/>
circumstantial history of the family's ups and downs <lb/>
and driftings to and fro in the Far West during the <lb/>
previous fifteen years. There was a message now from <lb/>
out back, and Colonel Sellers went out there in answer <lb/>
to it. Hawkins took this opportunity to ask how the <lb/>
world had been using the Colonel during the past half- <lb/>
generation.</p>
<p>"Oh, its been using him just the same; it couldn't <lb/>
change its way of using him if it wanted to, for he <lb/>
wouldn't let it."</p>
<p>"I can easily believe that, Mrs. Sellers."</p>
<p>"Yes, you see, he doesn't change, himself&#x2014;not <lb/>
the least little bit in the world; he's always Mulberry <lb/>
Sellers."</p>
<p>"I can see <i>that</i> plain enough."</p>
<p>"Just the same old scheming, generous, good- <lb/>
hearted, moonshiny, hopeful, no-account failure he <lb/>
always was, and still everybody likes him just as well <lb/>
as if he was the shiningest success."</p>
<p>"They always did; and it was natural, because he <lb/>
was so obliging and accommodating, and had some- <lb/>
thing about him that made it kind of easy to ask help <lb/>
of him, or favors&#x2014;you didn't feel shy, you know, or <lb/>
<pb n="26"/>
have that wish-you-didn't-have-to-try feeling that you <lb/>
have with other people."</p>
<p>"It's just so yet; and a body wonders at it, too, <lb/>
because he's been shamefully treated, many times, by <lb/>
people that had used him for a ladder to climb up by, <lb/>
and then kicked him down when they didn't need him <lb/>
any more. For a time you can see he's hurt, his <lb/>
pride's wounded, because he shrinks away from that <lb/>
thing and don't want to talk about it&#x2014;and so I used <lb/>
to think <i>now</i> he's learned something and he'll be more <lb/>
careful hereafter&#x2014;but laws! in a couple of weeks he's <lb/>
forgotten all about it, and any selfish tramp out of <lb/>
nobody knows where can come and put up a poor <lb/>
mouth and walk right into his heart with his boots on."</p>
<p>"It must try your patience pretty sharply some- <lb/>
times."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I'm used to it; and I'd rather have him <lb/>
so than the other way. When I call him a failure, I <lb/>
mean to the world he's a failure; he isn't to me. I <lb/>
don't know as I want him different&#x2014;much different, <lb/>
anyway. I have to scold him some, snarl at him, you <lb/>
might even call it, but I reckon I'd do that just the <lb/>
same if he was different&#x2014;it's my make. But I'm a <lb/>
good deal less snarly and more contented when he's a <lb/>
failure than I am when he isn't."</p>
<p>"Then he isn't always a failure," said Hawkins, <lb/>
brightening.</p>
<p>"Him? Oh, bless you, no. He makes a strike, as <lb/>
he calls it, from time to time. Then's my time to fret <lb/>
and fuss. For the money just flies&#x2014;first come first <lb/>
served. Straight off, he loads up the house with crip- <lb/>
ples and idiots and stray cats and all the different kinds <lb/>
of poor wrecks that other people don't want and he <lb/>
<i>does</i>, and then when the poverty comes again I've <i>got</i> <lb/>
to clear the most of them out or we'd starve; and that <lb/>
distresses him, and me the same, of course. Here's <lb/>
<pb n="27"/>
old Dan'l and old Jinny, that the sheriff sold South <lb/>
one of the times that we got bankrupted before the <lb/>
war&#x2014;they came wandering back after the peace, worn <lb/>
out and used up on the cotton plantations, helpless, and <lb/>
not another lick of work left in their old hides for the <lb/>
rest of this earthly pilgrimage&#x2014;and we so pinched, <lb/>
<i>oh</i>, so pinched for the very crumbs to keep life in us, <lb/>
and he just flung the door wide, and the way he <lb/>
received them you'd have thought they had come <lb/>
straight down from heaven in answer to prayer. I <lb/>
took him one side and said, 'Mulberry, we can't have <lb/>
them&#x2014;we've nothing for ourselves&#x2014;we can't feed <lb/>
them.' He looked at me kind of hurt, and said, <lb/>
'Turn them out?&#x2014;and they've come to me just as <lb/>
confident and trusting as&#x2014;as&#x2014;why, Polly, I must <lb/>
have <i>bought</i> that confidence some time or other a long <lb/>
time ago, and given my note, so to speak&#x2014;you don't <lb/>
get such things as a <i>gift</i>&#x2014;and how am I going to go <lb/>
back on a debt like that? And you see, they're so <lb/>
poor, and old, and friendless, and&#x2014;' But I was <lb/>
ashamed by that time, and shut him off, and somehow <lb/>
felt a new courage in me, and so I said, softly, 'We'll <lb/>
keep them&#x2014;the Lord will provide.' He was glad, <lb/>
and started to blurt out one of those over-confident <lb/>
speeches of his, but checked himself in time, and said <lb/>
humbly, '<i>I</i> will, anyway.' It was years and years and <lb/>
years ago. Well, you see those old wrecks are here <lb/>
yet."</p>
<p>"But don't they do your housework?"</p>
<p>"Laws! The idea. They would if they could, poor <lb/>
old things, and perhaps they think they <i>do</i> do some of <lb/>
it. But its a superstition. Dan'l waits on the front <lb/>
door, and sometimes goes on an errand; and some- <lb/>
times you'll see one or both of them letting on to dust <lb/>
around in here&#x2014;but that's because there's something <lb/>
they want to hear about and mix their gabble into. <lb/>
<pb n="28"/>
And they're always around at meals, for the same <lb/>
reason. But the fact is, we have to keep a young <lb/>
negro girl just to take care of <i>them</i>, and a negro <lb/>
woman to do the housework and <i>help</i> take care of <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>"Well, they ought to be tolerably happy, I should <lb/>
think."</p>
<p>"It's no name for it. They quarrel together pretty <lb/>
much all the time&#x2014;most always about religion, be- <lb/>
cause Dan'l's a Dunker Baptist and Jinny's a shouting <lb/>
Methodist, and Jinny believes in special Providences <lb/>
and Dan'l don't, because he thinks he's a kind of a <lb/>
free-thinker&#x2014;and they play and sing plantation hymns <lb/>
together, and talk and chatter just eternally and for- <lb/>
ever, and are sincerely fond of each other and think the <lb/>
world of Mulberry, and he puts up patiently with all <lb/>
their spoiled ways and foolishness, and so&#x2014;ah, well, <lb/>
they're happy enough if it comes to that. And I don't <lb/>
mind&#x2014;I've got used to it. I can get used to any- <lb/>
thing, with Mulberry to help; and the fact is, I don't <lb/>
much care what happens, so long as he's spared to <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"Well, here's to him, and hoping he'll make an- <lb/>
other strike soon."</p>
<p>"And rake in the lame, the halt, and the blind, and <lb/>
turn the house into a hospital again? It's what he <lb/>
would do. I've seen a plenty of that and more. No, <lb/>
Washington, I want his strikes to be mighty moderate <lb/>
ones the rest of the way down the vale."</p>
<p>"Well, then, big strike or little strike, or no strike <lb/>
at all, here's hoping he'll never lack for friends&#x2014;and <lb/>
I don't reckon he ever will while there's people around <lb/>
who know enough to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Him lack for friends!" and she tilted her head <lb/>
up with a frank pride&#x2014;"why, Washington, you can't <lb/>
name a man that's anybody that isn't fond of him. <lb/>
<pb n="29"/>
I'll tell you privately that I've had Satan's own time <lb/>
to keep them from appointing him to some office or <lb/>
other. They knew he'd no business with an office, <lb/>
just as well as I did, but he's the hardest man to refuse <lb/>
anything to a body ever saw. Mulberry Sellers with <lb/>
an office! laws goodness, you know what that would <lb/>
be like. Why, they'd come from the ends of the <lb/>
earth to see a circus like that. I'd just as lieves be <lb/>
married to Niagara Falls, and done with it." After a <lb/>
reflective pause she added&#x2014;having wandered back, in <lb/>
the interval, to the remark that had been her text: <lb/>
"Friends?&#x2014;oh, indeed, no man ever had more; and <lb/>
<i>such</i> friends: Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston, <lb/>
Longstreet, Lee&#x2014;many's the time they've sat in that <lb/>
chair you're sitting in&#x2014;" Hawkins was out of it <lb/>
instantly, and contemplating it with a reverential sur- <lb/>
prise, and with the awed sense of having trodden shod <lb/>
upon holy ground:</p>
<p>"<i>They!</i>" he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed, yes, a many and a many a time."</p>
<p>He continued to gaze at the chair, fascinated, mag- <lb/>
netized; and for once in his life that continental stretch <lb/>
of dry prairie which stood for his imagination was afire, <lb/>
and across it was marching a slanting flame-front that <lb/>
joined its wide horizons together and smothered the <lb/>
skies with smoke. He was experiencing what one or <lb/>
another drowsing, geographically ignorant alien experi- <lb/>
ences every day in the year when he turns a dull and <lb/>
indifferent eye out of the car window and it falls upon <lb/>
a certain station-sign which reads, "Stratford-on- <lb/>
Avon!" Mrs. Sellers went gossiping comfortably <lb/>
along:</p>
<p>"Oh, they like to hear him talk, especially if their <lb/>
load is getting rather heavy on one shoulder and they <lb/>
want to shift it. He's all air, you know&#x2014;breeze, you <lb/>
may say&#x2014;and he freshens them up; it's a trip to the <lb/>
<pb n="30"/>
country, they say. Many a time he's made General <lb/>
Grant laugh&#x2014;and that's a tidy job, I can tell you; <lb/>
and as for Sheridan, his eye lights up and he listens to <lb/>
Mulberry Sellers the same as if he was artillery. You <lb/>
see, the charm about Mulberry is, he is so catholic and <lb/>
unprejudiced that he fits in anywhere and everywhere. <lb/>
It makes him powerful good company, and as popular <lb/>
as scandal. You go to the White House when the <lb/>
President's holding a general reception&#x2014;some time <lb/>
when Mulberry's there. Why, dear me, <i>you</i> can't tell <lb/>
which of them it is that's holding that reception."</p>
<p>"Well, he certainly is a remarkable man&#x2014;and he <lb/>
always was. Is he religious?"</p>
<p>"Clear to his marrow&#x2014;does more thinking and <lb/>
reading on that subject than any other, except Russia <lb/>
and Siberia; thrashes around over the whole field, too; <lb/>
nothing bigoted about him."</p>
<p>"What is his religion?"</p>
<p>"He&#x2014;" She stopped, and was lost for a moment <lb/>
or two in thinking; then she said, with simplicity, "I <lb/>
think he was a Mohammedan or something last week."</p>
<p>Washington started down town now to bring his <lb/>
trunk, for the hospitable Sellerses would listen to no <lb/>
excuses; their house must be his home during the <lb/>
session. The Colonel returned presently and resumed <lb/>
work upon his plaything. It was finished when Wash- <lb/>
ington got back.</p>
<p>"There it is," said the Colonel, "all finished."</p>
<p>"What is it for, Colonel?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's just a trifle. Toy to amuse the children."</p>
<p>Washington examined it.</p>
<p>"It seems to be a puzzle."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what it is. I call it Pigs in the Clover. <lb/>
Put them in&#x2014;see if you can put them in the pen."</p>
<p>After many failures Washington succeeded, and was <lb/>
as pleased as a child.</p>
<pb n="31"/>
<p>"It's wonderfully ingenious, Colonel&#x2014;it's ever so <lb/>
clever. And interesting&#x2014;why, I could play with it <lb/>
all day. What are you going to do with it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing. Patent it and throw it aside."</p>
<p>"Don't you do anything of the kind. There's <lb/>
money in that thing."</p>
<p>A compassionate look traveled over the Colonel's <lb/>
countenance, and he said:</p>
<p>"Money&#x2014;yes; pin money; a couple of hundred <lb/>
thousand, perhaps. Not more."</p>
<p>Washington's eyes blazed.</p>
<p>"A couple of hundred thousand dollars! Do you <lb/>
call that pin money?"</p>
<p>The Colonel rose and tiptoed his way across the <lb/>
room, closed a door that was slightly ajar, tiptoed his <lb/>
way to his seat again, and said, under his breath:</p>
<p>"You can keep a secret?"</p>
<p>Washington nodded his affirmative; he was too awed <lb/>
to speak.</p>
<p>"You have heard of materialization&#x2014;materializa- <lb/>
tion of departed spirits?"</p>
<p>Washington had heard of it.</p>
<p>"And probably didn't believe in it; and quite right, <lb/>
too. The thing as practiced by ignorant charlatans is <lb/>
unworthy of attention or respect&#x2014;where there's a dim <lb/>
light and a dark cabinet, and a parcel of sentimental <lb/>
gulls gathered together, with their faith and their shud- <lb/>
ders and their tears all ready, and one and the same <lb/>
fatty degeneration of protoplasm and humbug comes <lb/>
out and materializes himself into anybody you want, <lb/>
grandmother, grandchild, brother-in-law, Witch of <lb/>
Endor, John Milton, Siamese Twins, Peter the Great, <lb/>
and all such frantic nonsense&#x2014;no, that is all foolish <lb/>
and pitiful. But when a man that is competent brings <lb/>
the vast powers of <i>science</i> to bear, it's a different matter <lb/>
&#x2014;a totally different matter, you see. The specter that <lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
answers <i>that</i> call has come to stay. Do you note the <lb/>
commercial value of that detail?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&#x2014;the&#x2014;the truth is, that I don't quite <lb/>
know that I do. Do you mean that such, being per- <lb/>
manent, not transitory, would give more general satis- <lb/>
faction, and so enhance the price of tickets to the <lb/>
show&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Show? Folly&#x2014;listen to me; and get a good grip <lb/>
on your breath, for you are going to need it. Within <lb/>
three days I shall have completed my method, and <lb/>
then&#x2014;let the world stand aghast, for it shall see mar- <lb/>
vels. Washington, within three days&#x2014;ten at the out- <lb/>
side&#x2014;you shall see me call the dead of any century, <lb/>
and they will arise and walk. Walk?&#x2014;they shall <lb/>
walk forever, and never die again. Walk with all the <lb/>
muscle and spring of their pristine vigor."</p>
<p>"Colonel! Indeed, it does take one's breath away."</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i> do you see the money that's in it?"</p>
<p>"I'm&#x2014;well, I'm&#x2014;not really sure that I do."</p>
<p>"Great Scott, look here! I shall have a monopoly; <lb/>
they'll all belong to me, won't they? Two thousand <lb/>
policemen in the city of New York. Wages, four dol- <lb/>
lars a day. I'll replace them with dead ones at half <lb/>
the money."</p>
<p>"Oh, prodigious! I never thought of that. F-o-u-r <lb/>
thousand dollars a day. Now I do begin to see! But <lb/>
will dead policemen answer?"</p>
<p>"Haven't they&#x2014;up to this time?"</p>
<p>"Well, if you put it that way&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Put it any way you want to. Modify it to suit <lb/>
yourself, and my lads shall still be superior. They <lb/>
won't eat, they won't drink&#x2014;don't need those things; <lb/>
they won't wink for cash at gambling-dens and un- <lb/>
licensed rum-holes, they won't spark the scullery <lb/>
maids; and, moreover, the bands of toughs that ambus- <lb/>
cade them on lonely beats and cowardly shoot and <lb/>
<pb n="33"/>
knife them will only damage the uniforms, and not live <lb/>
long enough to get more than a momentary satisfaction <lb/>
out of that."</p>
<p>"Why, Colonel, if you can furnish policemen, then <lb/>
of course&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Certainly&#x2014;I can furnish any line of goods that's <lb/>
wanted. Take the army, for instance&#x2014;now twenty- <lb/>
five thousand men; expense, twenty-two millions a <lb/>
year. I will dig up the Romans, I will resurrect the <lb/>
Greeks, I will furnish the government, for ten millions <lb/>
a year, ten thousand veterans drawn from the victorious <lb/>
legions of all the ages&#x2014;soldiers that will chase Indians <lb/>
year in and year out on materialized horses, and cost <lb/>
never a cent for rations or repairs. The armies of <lb/>
Europe cost two billions a year now&#x2014;I will replace <lb/>
them all for a billion. I will dig up the trained states- <lb/>
men of all ages and all climes, and furnish this country <lb/>
with a Congress that knows enough to come in out of <lb/>
the rain&#x2014;a thing that's never happened yet since the <lb/>
Declaration of Independence, and never will happen <lb/>
till these practically dead people are replaced with the <lb/>
genuine article. I will re-stock the thrones of Europe <lb/>
with the best brains and the best morals that all the <lb/>
royal sepulchers of all the centuries can furnish&#x2014; <lb/>
which isn't promising very much&#x2014;and I'll divide the <lb/>
wages and the civil list, fair and square, merely taking <lb/>
my half and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Colonel, if the half of this is true, there's millions <lb/>
in it&#x2014;millions."</p>
<p>"Billions in it&#x2014;billions; that's what you mean. <lb/>
Why, look here; the thing is so close at hand, so <lb/>
imminent, so absolutely immediate, that if a man were <lb/>
to come to me now and say, Colonel, I am a little <lb/>
short, and if you could lend me a couple of billion <lb/>
dollars for&#x2014;come in!"</p>
<p>This in answer to a knock. An energetic-looking <lb/>
<pb n="34"/>
man bustled in with a big pocket-book in his hand, <lb/>
took a paper from it and presented it, with the curt <lb/>
remark:</p>
<p>"Seventeenth and last call&#x2014;you want to out with <lb/>
that three dollars and forty cents this time without fail, <lb/>
Colonel Mulberry Sellers."</p>
<p>The Colonel began to slap this pocket and that one, <lb/>
and feel here and there and everywhere, muttering:</p>
<p>"What <i>have</i> I done with that wallet?&#x2014;let me see <lb/>
&#x2014;um&#x2014;not here, not there&#x2014;oh, I must have left it <lb/>
in the kitchen; I'll just run and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No you won't&#x2014;you'll stay right where you are. <lb/>
And you are going to disgorge, too&#x2014;this time."</p>
<p>Washington innocently offered to go and look. <lb/>
When he was gone the Colonel said:</p>
<p>"The fact is, I've got to throw myself on your in- <lb/>
dulgence just this once more, Suggs; you see, the <lb/>
remittances I was expecting&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Hang the remittances&#x2014;it's too stale&#x2014;it won't <lb/>
answer. Come!"</p>
<p>The Colonel glanced about him in despair. Then <lb/>
his face lighted; he ran to the wall and began to dust <lb/>
off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with his handker- <lb/>
chief. Then he brought it reverently, offered it to the <lb/>
collector, averted his face, and said:</p>
<p>"Take it, but don't let me see it go. It's the sole <lb/>
remaining Rembrandt that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Rembrandt be damned; it's a chromo."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't speak of it so, I beg you. It's the <lb/>
only really great original, the only supreme example, <lb/>
of that mighty school of art which&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Art! It's the sickest looking thing I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The Colonel was already bringing another horror <lb/>
and tenderly dusting it.</p>
<p>"Take this one too&#x2014;the gem of my collection&#x2014; <lb/>
the only genuine Fra Angelico that&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="35"/>
<p>"Illuminated liver-pad, that's what it is. Give it <lb/>
here&#x2014;good day&#x2014;people will think I've robbed a <lb/>
nigger barber-shop."</p>
<p>As he slammed the door behind him the Colonel <lb/>
shouted, with an anguished accent:</p>
<p>"Do please cover them up&#x2014;don't let the damp <lb/>
get at them. The delicate tints in the Angelico&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But the man was gone.</p>
<p>Washington reappeared, and said he had looked <lb/>
everywhere, and so had Mrs. Sellers and the servants, <lb/>
but in vain; and went on to say he wished he could <lb/>
get his eye on a certain man about this time&#x2014;no <lb/>
need to hunt up that pocket-book then. The Colonel's <lb/>
interest was awake at once.</p>
<p>"What man?"</p>
<p>"One-armed Pete they call him out there&#x2014;out in <lb/>
the Cherokee country, I mean. Robbed the bank in <lb/>
Tahlequah."</p>
<p>"Do they have banks in Tahlequah?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;<i>a</i> bank, anyway. He was suspected of <lb/>
robbing it. Whoever did it got away with more than <lb/>
twenty thousand dollars. They offered a reward of <lb/>
five thousand. I believe I saw that very man on my <lb/>
way east."</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;is that so?"</p>
<p>"I certainly saw a man on the train the first day I <lb/>
struck the railroad that answered the description pretty <lb/>
exactly&#x2014;at least, as to clothes and a lacking arm."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you get him arrested and claim the <lb/>
reward?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't. I had to get a requisition, of course. <lb/>
But I meant to stay by him till I got my chance."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well, he left the train during the night some time."</p>
<p>"Oh, hang it, that's too bad!"</p>
<p>"Not so very bad, either."</p>
<pb n="36"/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because he came down to Baltimore in the very <lb/>
train I was in, though I didn't know it in time. As <lb/>
we moved out of the station I saw him going toward <lb/>
the iron gate with a satchel in his hand."</p>
<p>"Good; we'll catch him. Let's lay a plan."</p>
<p>"Send description to the Baltimore police?"</p>
<p>"Why, what are you talking about? No. Do you <lb/>
want them to get the reward?"</p>
<p>"What shall we do, then?"</p>
<p>The Colonel reflected.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you. Put a personal in the Baltimore <lb/>
<i>Sun</i>. Word it like this: <lb/>
<q><b>A.</b> <smcap>drop me a line, pete</smcap>&#x2014;</q></p>
<p>"Hold on. Which arm has he lost?"</p>
<p>"The right."</p>
<p>"Good. Now then: <lb/>
<q><b>A.</b> <smcap>drop me a line, pete, even if you have to</smcap> <lb/>
write with your left hand. Address <smcap>X. Y. Z.,</smcap> General Post- <lb/>
office, Washington. From <smcap>you know who.</smcap></q>
There&#x2014;that'll fetch him."</p>
<p>"But he <i>won't</i> know who&#x2014;will he?"</p>
<p>"No, but he'll want to know, won't he?"</p>
<p>"Why, certainly&#x2014;I didn't think of that. What <lb/>
made you think of it?"</p>
<p>"Knowledge of human curiosity. Strong trait, very <lb/>
strong trait."</p>
<p>"Now I'll go to my room and write it out and en- <lb/>
close a dollar and tell them to print it to the worth of <lb/>
that."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER IV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> day wore itself out. After dinner the two <lb/>
friends put in a long and harassing evening try- <lb/>
ing to decide what to do with the five thousand dollars <lb/>
reward which they were going to get when they should <lb/>
find One-Armed Pete, and catch him, and prove him <lb/>
to be the right person, and extradite him, and ship <lb/>
him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory. But there <lb/>
were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that <lb/>
they found it impossible to make up their minds and <lb/>
keep them made up. Finally, Mrs. Sellers grew very <lb/>
weary of it all, and said:</p>
<p>"What is the sense in cooking a rabbit before it's <lb/>
caught?"</p>
<p>Then the matter was dropped for the time being, <lb/>
and all went to bed. Next morning, being persuaded <lb/>
by Hawkins, the Colonel made drawings and specifica- <lb/>
tions, and went down and applied for a patent for his <lb/>
toy puzzle, and Hawkins took the toy itself and started <lb/>
out to see what chance there might be to do something <lb/>
with it commercially. He did not have to go far. In <lb/>
a small old wooden shanty which had once been occu- <lb/>
pied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he <lb/>
found a keen-eyed Yankee engaged in repairing cheap <lb/>
chairs and other second-hand furniture. This man <lb/>
examined the toy indifferently; attempted to do the <lb/>
puzzle; found it not so easy as he had expected; grew <lb/>
more interested, and finally emphatically so; achieved <lb/>
a success at last, and asked:</p>
<pb n="38"/>
<p>"Is it patented?"</p>
<p>"Patent applied for."</p>
<p>"That will answer. What do you want for it?"</p>
<p>"What will it retail for?"</p>
<p>"Well, twenty-five cents, I should think."</p>
<p>"What will you give for the exclusive right?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't give twenty dollars if I had to pay cash <lb/>
down; but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll make it and <lb/>
market it, and pay you five cents royalty on each one."</p>
<p>Washington sighed. Another dream disappeared; <lb/>
no money in the thing. So he said:</p>
<p>"All right; take it at that. Draw me a paper."</p>
<p>He went his way with the paper, and dropped the <lb/>
matter out of his mind&#x2014;dropped it out to make room <lb/>
for further attempts to think out the most promising <lb/>
way to invest his half of the reward in case a partner- <lb/>
ship investment satisfactory to both beneficiaries could <lb/>
not be hit upon.</p>
<p>He had not been very long at home when Sellers <lb/>
arrived sodden with grief and booming with glad excite- <lb/>
ment&#x2014;working both these emotions successfully, <lb/>
sometimes separately, sometimes together. He fell <lb/>
on Hawkins's neck sobbing, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, mourn with me, my friend, mourn for my <lb/>
desolate house; death has smitten my last kinsman, <lb/>
and I am Earl of Rossmore&#x2014;congratulate me!"</p>
<p>He turned to his wife, who had entered while this was <lb/>
going on, put his arms about her, and said: "You <lb/>
will bear up, for my sake, my lady&#x2014;it had to happen, <lb/>
it was decreed."</p>
<p>She bore up very well, and said:</p>
<p>"It's no great loss. Simon Lathers was a poor, <lb/>
well-meaning, useless thing and no account, and his <lb/>
brother never was worth shucks."</p>
<p>The rightful earl continued:</p>
<p>"I am too much prostrated by these conflicting <lb/>
<pb n="39"/>
griefs and joys to be able to concentrate my mind upon <lb/>
affairs; I will ask our good friend here to break the <lb/>
news by wire or post to the Lady Gwendolen, and <lb/>
instruct her to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> Lady Gwendolen?"</p>
<p>"Our poor daughter, who, alas!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Sally Sellers? Mulberry Sellers, are you losing <lb/>
your mind?"</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;please do not forget who you are, and <lb/>
who I am; remember your own dignity, be considerate <lb/>
also of mine. It were best to cease from using my <lb/>
family name now, Lady Rossmore."</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious! well, I never! What <i>am</i> I to <lb/>
call you, then?"</p>
<p>"In private, the ordinary terms of endearment will <lb/>
still be admissible, to some degree; but in public it <lb/>
will be more becoming if your ladyship will speak <i>to</i> <lb/>
me as my lord, or your lordship, and <i>of</i> me as Ross- <lb/>
more, or the Earl, or his Lordship, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, scat! I can't ever do it, Berry."</p>
<p>"But, indeed, you must, my love&#x2014;we must live up <lb/>
to our altered position, and submit with what grace we <lb/>
may to its requirements."</p>
<p>"Well, all right, have it your own way; I've never <lb/>
set my wishes against your commands yet, Mul&#x2014;my <lb/>
lord, and it's late to begin now, though to my mind <lb/>
it's the rottenest foolishness that ever was."</p>
<p>"Spoken like my own true wife! There, kiss and <lb/>
be friends again."</p>
<p>"But&#x2014;Gwendolen! I don't know how I am ever <lb/>
going to stand that name. Why, a body wouldn't <lb/>
<i>know</i> Sally Sellers in it. It's too large for her; kind <lb/>
of like a cherub in an ulster, and it's a most outlandish <lb/>
sort of a name anyway, to my mind."</p>
<p>"You'll not hear her find fault with it, my lady."</p>
<p>"That's a true word. She takes to any kind of <lb/>
<pb n="40"/>
romantic rubbish like she was born to it. She never <lb/>
got it from me, that's sure. And sending her to that <lb/>
silly college hasn't helped the matter any&#x2014;just the <lb/>
other way."</p>
<p>"Now hear her, Hawkins! Rowena-Ivanhoe Col- <lb/>
lege is the selectest and most aristocratic seat of <lb/>
learning for young ladies in our country. Under no <lb/>
circumstances can a girl get in there unless she is either <lb/>
very rich and fashionable or can prove four generations <lb/>
of what may be called American nobility. Castellated <lb/>
college-buildings&#x2014;towers and turrets and an imitation <lb/>
moat&#x2014;and everything about the place named out of <lb/>
Sir Walter Scott's books and redolent of royalty and <lb/>
state and style; and all the richest girls keep phaetons, <lb/>
and coachmen in livery, and riding-horses, with English <lb/>
grooms in plug hats and tight-buttoned coats, and top- <lb/>
boots, and a whip-handle without any whip to it, to <lb/>
ride sixty-three feet behind them&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And they don't learn a blessed thing, Washington <lb/>
Hawkins, not a single blessed thing but showy rubbish <lb/>
and un-American pretentiousness. But send for the <lb/>
Lady Gwendolen&#x2014;do; for I reckon the peerage regu- <lb/>
lations require that she must come home and let on to <lb/>
go into seclusion and mourn for those Arkansas <lb/>
blatherskites she's lost."</p>
<p>"My darling! Blatherskites? Remember&#x2014;<i>noblesse <lb/>
oblige</i>."</p>
<p>"There, there&#x2014;talk to me in your own tongue, <lb/>
Ross&#x2014;you don't know any other, and you only botch <lb/>
it when you try. Oh, don't stare&#x2014;it was a slip, and <lb/>
no crime; customs of a lifetime can't be dropped in a <lb/>
second. Ross<i>more</i>&#x2014;there now, be appeased, and go <lb/>
along with you and attend to Gwendolen. Are you <lb/>
going to write, Washington?&#x2014;or telegraph?"</p>
<p>"He will telegraph, dear."</p>
<p>"I thought as much," my lady muttered, as she <lb/>
<pb n="41"/>
left the room. "Wants it so the address will have to <lb/>
appear on the envelope. It will just make a fool of <lb/>
that child. She'll get it, of course, for if there are any <lb/>
other Sellerses there they'll not be able to claim it. <lb/>
And just leave her alone to show it around and make <lb/>
the most of it&#x2026; &#x2026; Well, maybe she's forgiveable for <lb/>
that. She's so poor and they're so rich, of course <lb/>
she's had her share of snubs from the livery-flunky <lb/>
sort, and I reckon it's only human to want to get <lb/>
even."</p>
<p>Uncle Dan'l was sent with the telegram; for al- <lb/>
though a conspicuous object in a corner of the drawing- <lb/>
room was a telephone hanging on a transmitter, <lb/>
Washington found all attempts to raise the central <lb/>
office vain. The Colonel grumbled something about <lb/>
its being <i>always</i> out of order when you've got particu- <lb/>
lar and especial use for it," but he didn't explain that <lb/>
one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only <lb/>
a dummy and hadn't any wire attached to it. And <lb/>
yet the Colonel often used it&#x2014;when visitors were <lb/>
present&#x2014;and seemed to get messages through it. <lb/>
Mourning-paper and a seal were ordered; then the <lb/>
friends took a rest.</p>
<p>Next afternoon, while Hawkins, by request, draped <lb/>
Andrew Jackson's portrait with crape, the rightful earl <lb/>
wrote off the family bereavement to the usurper in <lb/>
England&#x2014;a letter which we have already read. He <lb/>
also, by letter to the village authorities at Duffy's <lb/>
Corners, Arkansas, gave order that the remains of the <lb/>
late twins be embalmed by some St. Louis expert and <lb/>
shipped at once to the usurper&#x2014;with bill. Then he <lb/>
drafted out the Rossmore arms and motto on a great <lb/>
sheet of brown paper, and he and Hawkins took it to <lb/>
Hawkins's Yankee furniture-mender and at the end of <lb/>
an hour came back with a couple of stunning hatch- <lb/>
ments, which they nailed up on the front of the house <lb/>
<pb n="42"/>
&#x2014;attractions calculated to draw, and they did; for it <lb/>
was mainly an idle and shiftless negro neighborhood, <lb/>
with plenty of ragged children and indolent dogs to <lb/>
spare for a point of interest like that, and keep on <lb/>
sparing them for it, days and days together.</p>
<p>The new earl found&#x2014;without surprise&#x2014;this society <lb/>
item in the evening paper, and cut it out and scrap- <lb/>
booked it: <lb/>
<q>By a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow-citizen, Colonel Mulberry <lb/>
Sellers, Perpetual Member-at-large of the Diplomatic Body, succeeds, as <lb/>
rightful lord, to the great earldom of Rossmore, third by order of precedence <lb/>
in the earldoms of Great Britain, and will take early measures, by suit in <lb/>
the House of Lords, to wrest the title and estates from the present usurping <lb/>
holder of them. Until the season of mourning is past, the usual Thursday <lb/>
evening receptions at Rossmore Towers will be discontinued.</q></p>
<p>Lady Rossmore's comment&#x2014;to herself:</p>
<p>"Receptions! People who don't rightly know him <lb/>
may think he is commonplace, but to my mind he is <lb/>
one of the most unusual men I ever saw. As for sud- <lb/>
denness and capacity in imagining things, his beat <lb/>
don't exist, I reckon. As like as not it wouldn't have <lb/>
occurred to anybody else to name this poor old rat- <lb/>
trap Rossmore Towers, but it just comes natural to <lb/>
him. Well, no doubt it's a blessed thing to have an <lb/>
imagination that can always make you satisfied, no <lb/>
matter how you are fixed. Uncle Dave Hopkins used <lb/>
to always say, 'Turn me into John Calvin, and I want <lb/>
to know which place I'm going to; turn me into Mul- <lb/>
berry Sellers, and I don't care.'"</p>
<p>The rightful earl's comment&#x2014;to himself:</p>
<p>"It's a beautiful name, beautiful. Pity I didn't <lb/>
think of it before I wrote the usurper. But I'll be <lb/>
ready for him when he answers."</p>

<p><smcap>No</smcap> answer to that telegram; no arriving daughter. <lb/>
Yet nobody showed any uneasiness or seemed <lb/>
surprised; that is, nobody but Washington. After <lb/>
three days of waiting he asked Lady Rossmore what <lb/>
she supposed the trouble was. She answered tran- <lb/>
quilly:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's some notion of hers; you never can tell. <lb/>
She's a Sellers all through&#x2014;at least, in some of her <lb/>
ways; and a Sellers can't tell you beforehand what <lb/>
he's going to do, because he don't know himself till <lb/>
he's done it. <i>She's</i> all right; no occasion to worry <lb/>
about <i>her</i>. When she's ready she'll come or she'll <lb/>
write, and you can't tell which till it's happened."</p>
<p>It turned out to be a letter. It was handed in at <lb/>
that moment, and was received by the mother without <lb/>
trembling hands or feverish eagerness, or any other of <lb/>
the manifestations common in the case of long-delayed <lb/>
answers to imperative telegrams. She polished her <lb/>
glasses with tranquility and throughness, pleasantly <lb/>
gossiping along the while, then opened the letter and <lb/>
began to read aloud:</p>

</opener>
<p>Oh, the joy of it!&#x2014;you can't think. They had always turned up their <lb/>
noses at our pretensions, you know; and I had fought back as well as I <lb/>
could by turning up mine at theirs. They always said it might be some- <lb/>
<pb n="44"/>
thing great and fine to be the rightful Shadow of an earldom, but to merely <lb/>
be shadow <i>of</i> a shadow, and two or three times removed at that&#x2014;pooh- <lb/>
pooh! And I always retorted that not to be able to show four genera- <lb/>
tions of American-Colonial-Dutch-Peddler-and-Salt-Cod-McAllister-Nobility <lb/>
might be endurable, but to <i>have</i> to confess such an origin&#x2014;pfew-few! <lb/>
Well, the telegram, it was just a cyclone! The messenger came right into <lb/>
the great Rob Roy Hall of Audience, as excited as he could be, singing <lb/>
out, "Dispatch for Lady Gwendolen Sellers!" and you ought to have seen <lb/>
that simpering chattering assemblage of pinchbeck aristocrats turn to stone! <lb/>
I was off in the corner, of course, by myself&#x2014;it's where Cinderella belongs. <lb/>
I took the telegram and read, and tried to faint&#x2014;and I could have done it <lb/>
if I had had any preparation, but it was all so sudden, you know&#x2014;but no <lb/>
matter, I did the next best thing: I put my handkerchief to my eyes and <lb/>
fled sobbing to my room, dropping the telegram as I started. I released <lb/>
one corner of my eye a moment&#x2014;just enough to see the herd swarm for <lb/>
the telegram&#x2014;and then continued my broken-hearted flight just as happy <lb/>
as a bird.</p>
<p>Then the visits of condolence began, and I had to accept the loan of <lb/>
Miss Augusta-Templeton-Ashmore Hamilton's quarters because the press <lb/>
was so great and there isn't room for three and a cat in mine. And I've <lb/>
been holding a Lodge of Sorrow ever since and defending myself against <lb/>
people's attempts to claim kin. And do you know, the very first girl to <lb/>
fetch her tears and sympathy to my market was that foolish Skimperton girl <lb/>
who has always snubbed me so shamefully and claimed lordship and prece- <lb/>
dence of the whole college because some ancestor of hers, some time or <lb/>
other, was a McAllister. Why, it was like the bottom bird in the menagerie <lb/>
putting on airs because its head ancestor was a pterodactyl.</p>
<p>But the ger-reatest triumph of all was&#x2014;guess. But you'll never. This <lb/>
is it. That little fool and two others have always been fussing and fretting <lb/>
over which was entitled to precedence&#x2014;by rank, you know. They've <lb/>
nearly starved themselves at it; for each claimed the right to take prece- <lb/>
dence of all the college in leaving the table, and so neither of them ever <lb/>
finished her dinner, but broke off in the middle and tried to get out ahead of <lb/>
the others. Well, after my first day's grief and seclusion&#x2014;I was fixing up <lb/>
a mourning dress, you see&#x2014;I appeared at the public table again, and then <lb/>
&#x2014;what do you think? Those three fluffy goslings sat there contentedly, <lb/>
and squared up the long famine&#x2014;lapped and lapped, munched and <lb/>
munched, ate and ate, till the gravy appeared in their eyes&#x2014;humbly wait- <lb/>
ing for the Lady Gwendolen to take precedence and move out first, you see!</p>
<p>Oh, yes, I've been having a darling good time. And do you know, not <lb/>
<pb n="45"/>
one of these collegians has had the cruelty to ask me how I came by my <lb/>
new name. With some, this is due to charity, but with the others it isn't. <lb/>
They refrain, not from native kindness but from educated discretion. I <lb/>
educated them.</p>
<p>Well, as soon as I shall have settled up what's left of the old scores and <lb/>
snuffed up a few more of those pleasantly intoxicating clouds of incense, I <lb/>
shall pack and depart homeward. Tell papa I am as fond of him as I <lb/>
am of my new name. I couldn't put it stronger than that. What an <lb/>
inspiration it was! But inspirations come easy to him.</p>

<p>Hawkins reached for the letter and glanced over it.</p>
<p>"Good hand," he said, "and full of confidence and <lb/>
animation, and goes racing right along. She's bright <lb/>
&#x2014;that's plain."</p>
<p>"Oh, they're all bright&#x2014;the Sellerses. Anyway, <lb/>
they would be, if there were any. Even those poor <lb/>
Latherses would have been bright if they had been <lb/>
Sellerses; I mean full blood. Of course, they had a <lb/>
Sellers strain in them&#x2014;a big strain of it, too&#x2014;but <lb/>
being a Bland dollar don't make it a <i>dollar</i> just the <lb/>
same."</p>
<p>The seventh day after the date of the telegram <lb/>
Washington came dreaming down to breakfast and was <lb/>
set wide awake by an electrical spasm of pleasure. <lb/>
Here was the most beautiful young creature he had <lb/>
ever seen in his life. It was Sally Sellers, Lady Gwen- <lb/>
dolen; she had come in the night. And it seemed to <lb/>
him that her clothes were the prettiest and the daintiest <lb/>
he had ever looked upon, and the most exquisitely <lb/>
contrived and fashioned and combined, as to decorative <lb/>
trimmings, and fixings, and melting harmonies of color. <lb/>
It was only a morning dress, and inexpensive, but he <lb/>
confessed to himself, in the English common to <lb/>
Cherokee Strip, that it was a "corker." And now, <lb/>
as he perceived, the reason why the Sellers household <lb/>
<pb n="46"/>
poverties and sterilities had been made to blossom like <lb/>
the rose, and charm the eye and satisfy the spirit, stood <lb/>
explained; here was the magician; here in the midst <lb/>
of her works, and furnishing in her own person the <lb/>
proper accent and climaxing finish of the whole.</p>
<p>"My daughter, Major Hawkins&#x2014;come home to <lb/>
mourn; flown home at the call of affliction to help the <lb/>
authors of her being bear the burden of bereavement. <lb/>
She was very fond of the late earl&#x2014;idolized him, sir, <lb/>
idolized him&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, father, I've never seen him."</p>
<p>"True&#x2014;she's right, I was thinking of another&#x2014; <lb/>
er&#x2014;of her mother&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> idolized that smoked haddock?&#x2014;that senti- <lb/>
mental, spiritless&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I was thinking of myself! Poor noble fellow, we <lb/>
were inseparable com&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Hear the man! Mulberry Sel&#x2014;Mul&#x2014;Ross- <lb/>
more!&#x2014;hang the troublesome name, I can never&#x2014; <lb/>
if I've heard you say once I've heard you say a thou- <lb/>
sand times that if that poor sheep&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I was thinking of&#x2014;of&#x2014;I don't know who I was <lb/>
thinking of, and it doesn't make any difference any <lb/>
way; <i>some</i>body idolized him, I recollect it as if it were <lb/>
yesterday; and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Father, I am going to shake hands with Major <lb/>
Hawkins, and let the introduction work along and <lb/>
catch up at its leisure. I remember you very well, <lb/>
indeed, Major Hawkins, although I was a little child <lb/>
when I saw you last; and I am very, very glad, in- <lb/>
deed, to see you again and have you in our house as <lb/>
one of us;" and beaming in his face she finished her <lb/>
cordial shake with the hope that he had not forgotten <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>He was prodigiously pleased by her outspoken hearti- <lb/>
ness, and wanted to repay her by assuring her that he <lb/>
<pb n="47"/>
remembered her, and not only that but better even <lb/>
than he remembered his own children, but the facts <lb/>
would not quite warrant this; still, he stumbled through <lb/>
a tangled sentence which answered just as well, since <lb/>
the purport of it was an awkward and unintentional <lb/>
confession that her extraordinary beauty had so stupe- <lb/>
fied him that he hadn't got back to his bearings yet, <lb/>
and therefore couldn't be certain as to whether he <lb/>
remembered her at all or not. The speech made him <lb/>
her friend; it couldn't well help it.</p>
<p>In truth, the beauty of this fair creature was of a <lb/>
rare type, and may well excuse a moment of our time <lb/>
spent in its consideration. It did not consist in the <lb/>
<i>fact</i> that she had eyes, nose, mouth, chin, hair, ears; <lb/>
it consisted in their arrangement. In true beauty, <lb/>
more depends upon right location and judicious distri- <lb/>
bution of feature than upon multiplicity of them. So <lb/>
also as regards color. The very combination of colors <lb/>
which in a volcanic irruption would add beauty to a <lb/>
landscape might detach it from a girl. Such was <lb/>
Gwendolen Sellers.</p>
<p>The family circle being completed by Gwendolen's <lb/>
arrival, it was decreed that the official mourning should <lb/>
now begin; that it should begin at six o'clock every <lb/>
evening (the dinner hour) and end with the dinner.</p>
<p>"It's a grand old line, Major, a sublime old line, <lb/>
and deserves to be mourned for almost royally; almost <lb/>
imperially, I may say. Er&#x2014;Lady Gwendolen&#x2014;but <lb/>
she's gone; never mind; I wanted my Peerage; I'll <lb/>
fetch it myself, presently, and show you a thing or two <lb/>
that will give you a realizing idea of what our house <lb/>
is. I've been glancing through <i>Burke</i>, and I find that <lb/>
of William the Conqueror's sixty-four natural ch&#x2014;my <lb/>
dear, would you mind getting me that book? It's on <lb/>
the escritoire in our boudoir. Yes, as I was saying, <lb/>
there's only St. Albans, Buccleuch, and Grafton ahead <lb/>
<pb n="48"/>
of us on the list&#x2014;all the rest of the British nobility <lb/>
are in procession behind us. Ah, thanks, my lady. <lb/>
Now then, we turn to William, and we find&#x2014;letter for <lb/>
XYZ? Oh, splendid&#x2014;when'd you get it?"</p>
<p>"Last night; but I was asleep before you came, <lb/>
you were out so late; and when I came to breakfast <lb/>
Miss Gwendolen&#x2014;well, she knocked everything out <lb/>
of me, you know&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wonderful girl, wonderful; her great origin is <lb/>
detectable in her step, her carriage, her features&#x2014;but <lb/>
what does he <i>say?</i> Come, this is exciting."</p>
<p>"I haven't read it&#x2014;er&#x2014;Rossm&#x2014;Mr. Rossm&#x2014; <lb/>
er&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"M'lord! Just cut it short like that. It's the <lb/>
English way. I'll open it. Ah, now let's see.</p>
<q><b>A.</b> <smcap>to you know who.</smcap> Think I know you. Wait ten days. <lb/>
Coming to Washington.</q>
<p>The excitement died out of both men's faces. There <lb/>
was a brooding silence for a while; then the younger <lb/>
one said, with a sigh:</p>
<p>"Why, <i>we</i> can't wait ten days for the money."</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;the man's unreasonable; we are down to <lb/>
the bed rock, financially speaking."</p>
<p>"If we could explain to him in some way that we <lb/>
are so situated that time is of the utmost importance <lb/>
to us&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Yes-yes, that's it&#x2014;and so if it would be as con- <lb/>
venient for him to come at once it would be a great <lb/>
accommodation to us, and one which we&#x2014;which we <lb/>
&#x2014;which we&#x2014;wh&#x2014;well, which we should sincerely <lb/>
appreciate&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That's it&#x2014;and most gladly reciprocate&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Certainly&#x2014;that'll fetch him. Worded right, if <lb/>
he's a <i>man</i>&#x2014;got any of the <i>feelings</i> of a man, <lb/>
<i>sympathies</i> and all that, he'll be here inside of twenty- <lb/>
<pb n="49"/>
four hours. Pen and paper&#x2014;come, we'll get right <lb/>
at it."</p>
<p>Between them they framed twenty-two different ad- <lb/>
vertisements, but none was satisfactory. A main fault <lb/>
in all of them was urgency. That feature was very <lb/>
troublesome: if made prominent, it was calculated to <lb/>
excite Pete's suspicion; if modified below the suspicion- <lb/>
point it was flat and meaningless. Finally the Colonel <lb/>
resigned, and said:</p>
<p>"I have noticed, in such literary experiences as I <lb/>
have had, that one of the most taking things to do is <lb/>
to conceal your meaning when you are <i>trying</i> to con- <lb/>
ceal it. Whereas, if you go at literature with a free <lb/>
conscience and nothing to conceal, you can turn out a <lb/>
book, every time, that the very elect can't under- <lb/>
stand. They all do."</p>
<p>Then Hawkins resigned also, and the two agreed <lb/>
that they must manage to wait the ten days somehow <lb/>
or other. Next, they caught a ray of cheer; since <lb/>
they had something definite to go upon now they could <lb/>
probably borrow money on the reward&#x2014;enough, at <lb/>
any rate, to tide them over till they got it; and mean- <lb/>
time the materializing recipe would be perfected, and <lb/>
then good-bye to trouble for good and all.</p>
<p>The next day, May the 10th, a couple of things <lb/>
happened&#x2014;among others. The remains of the noble <lb/>
Arkansas twins left our shores for England, consigned <lb/>
to Lord Rossmore, and Lord Rossmore's son, Kirk- <lb/>
cudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount <lb/>
Berkeley, sailed from Liverpool for America to place <lb/>
the reversion of the earldom in the hands of the right- <lb/>
ful peer, Mulberry Sellers, of Rossmore Towers in the <lb/>
District of Columbia, U. S. A.</p>
<p>These two impressive shipments would meet and <lb/>
part in mid-Atlantic five days later, and give no sign.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VI">
<pb n="50"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER VI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> the course of time the twins arrived and were de- <lb/>
livered to their great kinsman. To try to describe <lb/>
the rage of that old man would profit nothing, the <lb/>
attempt would fall so far short of the purpose. How- <lb/>
ever, when he had worn himself out and got quiet <lb/>
again, he looked the matter over and decided that the <lb/>
twins had some moral rights, although they had no <lb/>
legal ones; they were of his blood, and it could not <lb/>
be decorous to treat them as common clay. So he <lb/>
laid them with their majestic kin in the Cholmondeley <lb/>
church, with imposing state and ceremony, and added <lb/>
the supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner <lb/>
himself. But he drew the line at hatchments.</p>
<p>Our friends in Washington watched the weary days <lb/>
go by while they waited for Pete and covered his name <lb/>
with reproaches because of his calamitous procrastina- <lb/>
tions. Meantime, Sally Sellers, who was as practical <lb/>
and democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was <lb/>
romantic and aristocratic, was leading a life of intense <lb/>
interest and activity, and getting the most she could <lb/>
out of her double personality. All day long in the <lb/>
privacy of her work-room Sally Sellers earned bread <lb/>
for the Sellers family, and all the evening Lady Gwen- <lb/>
dolen Sellers supported the Rossmore dignity. All <lb/>
day she was American, practically, and proud of the <lb/>
work of her head and hands and its commercial result; <lb/>
all the evening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich <lb/>
<pb n="51"/>
shadowland peopled with titled and coroneted fictions. <lb/>
By day, to her, the place was a plain, unaffected, ram- <lb/>
shackle old trap&#x2014;just that, and nothing more; by <lb/>
night it was Rossmore Towers. At college she had <lb/>
learned a trade without knowing it. The girls had <lb/>
found out that she was the designer of her own gowns. <lb/>
She had no idle moments after that, and wanted none; <lb/>
for the exercise of an extraordinary gift is the <lb/>
supremest pleasure in life, and it was manifest that <lb/>
Sally Sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the matter <lb/>
of costume designing. Within three days after reach- <lb/>
ing home she had hunted up some work; before Pete <lb/>
was yet due in Washington, and before the twins were <lb/>
fairly asleep in English soil, she was already nearly <lb/>
swamped with work, and the sacrificing of the family <lb/>
chromos for debt had got an effective check.</p>
<p>"She's a brick," said Rossmore to the Major; <lb/>
"just her father all over; prompt to labor with head <lb/>
or hands, and not ashamed of it; capable, always <lb/>
capable, let the enterprise be what it may; successful <lb/>
by nature&#x2014;don't know what defeat is; thus, intensely <lb/>
and practically American by inhaled nationalism, and <lb/>
at the same time intensely and aristocratically European <lb/>
by inherited nobility of blood. Just me, exactly; Mul- <lb/>
berry Sellers in matter of finance and invention; after <lb/>
office hours, what do you find? The same clothes, <lb/>
yes, but what's in them? Rossmore of the peerage."</p>
<p>The two friends had haunted the general post-office <lb/>
daily. At last they had their reward. Toward even- <lb/>
ing on the 20th of May they got a letter for XYZ. It <lb/>
bore the Washington postmark; the note itself was not <lb/>
dated. It said: <lb/>
<q>Ash barrel back of lamp post Black horse Alley. If you are playing <lb/>
square go and set on it to-morrow morning 21st 10.22 not sooner not later <lb/>
wait till I come.</q></p>
<pb n="52"/>
<p>The friends cogitated over the note profoundly. <lb/>
Presently the earl said:</p>
<p>"Don't you reckon he's afraid we are a sheriff with <lb/>
a requisition?"</p>
<p>"Why, m'lord?"</p>
<p>"Because that's no place for a s&#x00E9;ance. Nothing <lb/>
friendly, nothing sociable about it. And at the same <lb/>
time, a body that wanted to know who was roosting on <lb/>
that ash-barrel without exposing himself by going near <lb/>
it, or seeming to be interested in it, could just stand <lb/>
on the street corner and take a glance down the alley <lb/>
and satisfy himself, don't you see?"</p>
<p>"Yes, his idea is plain now. He seems to be a <lb/>
man that can't <i>be</i> candid and straightforward. He acts <lb/>
as if he thought we&#x2014;shucks, I wish he had come out <lb/>
like a man and told us what hotel he&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Now you've struck it! you've struck it sure, <lb/>
Washington; he has told us."</p>
<p>"Has he?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he has; but he didn't mean to. That alley <lb/>
is a lonesome little pocket that runs along one side of <lb/>
the New Gadsby. That's his hotel."</p>
<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>
<p>"Why, I just know it. He's got a room that's just <lb/>
across from that lamppost. He's going to sit there <lb/>
perfectly comfortable behind his shutters at 10.22 to- <lb/>
morrow, and when he sees us sitting on the ash-barrel, <lb/>
he'll say to himself, 'I saw <i>one</i> of those fellows on the <lb/>
train'&#x2014;and then he'll pack his satchel in half a minute <lb/>
and ship for the ends of the earth."</p>
<p>Hawkins turned sick with disappointment.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, it's all up, Colonel&#x2014;it's exactly what <lb/>
he'll do."</p>
<p>"Indeed, he won't!"</p>
<p>"Won't he? Why?"</p>
<p>"Because <i>you</i> won't be holding the ash-barrel down; <lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
it'll be me. You'll be coming in with an officer and a <lb/>
requisition in plain clothes&#x2014;the officer, I mean&#x2014;the <lb/>
minute you see him arrive and open up a talk with <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"Well, what a head you have got, Colonel Sellers! <lb/>
I never should have thought of that in the world."</p>
<p>"Neither would any earl of Rossmore, betwixt <lb/>
William's contribution and Mulberry&#x2014;<i>as</i> earl; but <lb/>
it's office hours now, you see, and the earl in me <lb/>
sleeps. Come&#x2014;I'll show you his very room."</p>
<p>They reached the neighborhood of the New Gadsby <lb/>
about nine in the evening, and passed down the alley <lb/>
to the lamp-post.</p>
<p>"There you are," said the Colonel, triumphantly, <lb/>
with a wave of his hand which took in the whole side <lb/>
of the hotel. "There it is&#x2014;what did I tell you?"</p>
<p>"Well, but&#x2014;why, Colonel, it's six stories high. I <lb/>
don't quite make out which window you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"All the windows, all of them. Let him have his <lb/>
choice&#x2014;I'm indifferent now that I have located him. <lb/>
You go and stand on the corner and wait; I'll prospect <lb/>
the hotel."</p>
<p>The earl drifted here and there through the swarm- <lb/>
ing lobby, and finally took a waiting position in the <lb/>
neighborhood of the elevator. During an hour crowds <lb/>
went up and crowds came down; and all complete as <lb/>
to limbs; but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a <lb/>
figure that was satisfactory&#x2014;got a glimpse of the <lb/>
back of it, though he had missed his chance at the face <lb/>
through waning alertness. The glimpse revealed a <lb/>
cowboy hat and below it a plaided sack of rather loud <lb/>
pattern, and an empty sleeve pinned up to the shoul- <lb/>
der. Then the elevator snatched the vision aloft, and <lb/>
the watcher fled away in joyful excitement and rejoined <lb/>
the fellow-conspirator.</p>
<p>"We've got him, Major&#x2014;got him sure! I've seen <lb/>
<pb n="54"/>
him&#x2014;seen him good; and I don't care where or <lb/>
when that man approaches me backwards, I'll recog- <lb/>
nize him every time. We're all right. Now for the <lb/>
requisition."</p>
<p>They got it, after the delays usual in such cases. <lb/>
By half-past eleven they were at home and happy, and <lb/>
went to bed full of dreams of the morrow's great <lb/>
promise.</p>
<p>Among the elevator load which had the suspect for <lb/>
fellow-passengers was a young kinsman of Mulberry <lb/>
Sellers, but Mulberry was not aware of it and didn't <lb/>

<head><b>CHAPTER VII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Arrived</smcap> in his room Lord Berkeley made prepara- <lb/>
tions for that first and last and all-the-time duty <lb/>
of the visiting Englishman&#x2014;the jotting down in his <lb/>
diary of his "impressions" to date. His preparations <lb/>
consisted in ransacking his "box" for a pen. There <lb/>
was a plenty of steel pens on his table with the ink <lb/>
bottle, but he was English. The English people manu- <lb/>
facture steel pens for nineteen-twentieths of the globe, <lb/>
but they never use any themselves. They use exclu- <lb/>
sively the prehistoric quill. My lord not only found a <lb/>
quill pen, but the best one he had seen in several years <lb/>
&#x2014;and after writing diligently for some time, closed <lb/>
with the following entry: <lb/>
<q>But in one thing I have made an immense mistake. I ought to have <lb/>
sunk my title and changed my name before I started.</q></p>
<p>He sat admiring that pen awhile, and then went on: <lb/>
<q>All attempts to mingle with the common people and become permanently <lb/>
one of them are going to fail, unless I can get rid of it, disappear from it, <lb/>
and reappear with the solid protection of a new name. I am astonished <lb/>
and pained to see how eager the most of these Americans are to get <lb/>
acquainted with a lord, and how dilligent they are in pushing attentions <lb/>
upon him. They lack English servility, it is true&#x2014;but they could acquire <lb/>
it, with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the most mysterious <lb/>
way. I write my family name without additions, on the register of this <lb/>
hotel, and imagine that I am going to pass for an obscure and unknown <lb/>
wanderer, but the clerk promptly calls out, "Front! show his lordship to <lb/>
four-eighty-two!" and before I can get to the lift there is a reporter trying <lb/>
<pb n="56"/>
to interview me, as they call it. This sort of thing shall cease at once. I <lb/>
will hunt up the American Claimant the first thing in the morning, accom- <lb/>
plish my mission, then change my lodging and vanish from scrutiny under <lb/>
a fictitious name.</q></p>
<p>He left his diary on the table, where it would be <lb/>
handy in case any new "impressions" should wake <lb/>
him up in the night, then he went to bed and presently <lb/>
fell asleep. An hour or two passed, and then he came <lb/>
slowly to consciousness with a confusion of mysterious <lb/>
and augmenting sounds hammering at the gates of his <lb/>
brain for admission; the next moment he was sharply <lb/>
awake, and those sounds burst with the rush and roar <lb/>
and boom of an undammed freshet into his ears. <lb/>
Banging and slamming of shutters; smashing of win- <lb/>
dows and the ringing clash of falling glass; clatter of <lb/>
flying feet along the halls; shrieks, supplications, dumb <lb/>
moanings of despair within, hoarse shouts of command <lb/>
outside; cracklings and snappings, and the windy roar <lb/>
of victorious flames!</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang! on the door, and a cry:</p>
<p>"Turn out&#x2014;the house is on fire!"</p>
<p>The cry passed on, and the banging. Lord Berkeley <lb/>
sprang out of bed and moved with all possible speed <lb/>
toward the clothespress in the darkness and the gather- <lb/>
ing smoke, but fell over a chair and lost his bearings. <lb/>
He groped desperately about on his hands, and pres- <lb/>
ently struck his head against the table and was deeply <lb/>
grateful, for it gave him his bearings again, since it <lb/>
stood close by the door. He seized his most precious <lb/>
possession, his journaled Impressions of America, and <lb/>
darted from the room.</p>
<p>He ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp <lb/>
which he knew indicated the place of a fire-escape. <lb/>
The door of the room beside it was open. In the <lb/>
room the gas was burning full head; on a chair was a <lb/>
pile of clothing. He ran to the window, could not get <lb/>
<pb n="57"/>
it up, but smashed it with a chair, and stepped out on <lb/>
the landing of the fire-escape; below him was a crowd <lb/>
of men, with a sprinkling of women and youth, massed <lb/>
in a ruddy light. Must he go down in his spectral <lb/>
night-dress? No&#x2014;this side of the house was not yet <lb/>
on fire except at the farther end; he would snatch on <lb/>
those clothes. Which he did. They fitted well enough, <lb/>
though a trifle loosely, and they were just a shade loud <lb/>
as to pattern. Also as to hat&#x2014;which was of a new <lb/>
breed to him, Buffalo Bill not having been to England <lb/>
yet. One side of the coat went on, but the other side <lb/>
refused; one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched <lb/>
to the shoulder. He started down without waiting to <lb/>
get it loose, made the trip successfully, and was <lb/>
promptly hustled outside the limit-rope by the police.</p>
<p>The cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him <lb/>
too much of a center of attraction for comfort, al- <lb/>
though nothing could be more profoundly respectful, <lb/>
not to say deferential, than was the manner of the <lb/>
crowd toward him. In his mind he framed a discour- <lb/>
aged remark for early entry in his diary: "It is of no <lb/>
use; they know a lord through any disguise, and show <lb/>
awe of him&#x2014;even something very like fear, indeed."</p>
<p>Presently one of the gaping and adoring half-circle <lb/>
of boys ventured a timid question. My lord answered <lb/>
it. The boys glanced wonderingly at each other, and <lb/>
from somewhere fell the comment:</p>
<p>"<i>English</i> cowboy! Well, if that ain't curious."</p>
<p>Another mental note to be preserved for the diary: <lb/>
"Cowboy. Now what might a cowboy be? Per- <lb/>
haps&#x2014;" But the viscount perceived that some more <lb/>
questions were about to be asked; so he worked his <lb/>
way out of the crowd, released the sleeve, put on the <lb/>
coat, and wandered away to seek a humble and obscure <lb/>
lodging. He found it, and went to bed and was soon <lb/>
asleep.</p>
<pb n="58"/>
<p>In the morning he examined his clothes. They were <lb/>
rather assertive, it seemed to him, but they were new <lb/>
and clean, at any rate. There was considerable prop- <lb/>
erty in the pockets. Item, five one hundred dollar <lb/>
bills. Item, near fifty dollars in small bills and silver. <lb/>
Plug of tobacco. Hymn-book, which refuses to open; <lb/>
found to contain whisky. Memorandum-book bearing <lb/>
no name. Scattering entries in it, recording in a <lb/>
sprawling, ignorant hand, appointments, bets, horse- <lb/>
trades, and so on, with people of strange, hyphenated <lb/>
name&#x2014;Six-Fingered Jake, Young-Man-afraid-of-his- <lb/>
Shadow, and the like. No letters, no documents.</p>
<p>The young man muses&#x2014;maps out his course. His <lb/>
letter of credit is burned; he will borrow the small bills <lb/>
and the silver in these pockets, apply part of it to <lb/>
advertising for the owner, and use the rest for sus- <lb/>
tenance while he seeks work. He sends out for the <lb/>
morning paper next, and proceeds to read about the <lb/>
fire. The biggest line in the display-head announces <lb/>
his own death! The body of the account furnishes all <lb/>
the particulars; and tells how, with the inherited hero- <lb/>
ism of his caste, he went on saving women and children <lb/>
until escape for himself was impossible; then with the <lb/>
eyes of weeping multitudes upon him, he stood with <lb/>
folded arms and sternly awaited the approach of the <lb/>
devouring fiend; "and so standing, amid a tossing sea <lb/>
of flame and on-rushing billows of smoke, the noble <lb/>
young heir of the great house of Rossmore was caught <lb/>
up in a whirlwind of fiery glory, and disappeared for- <lb/>
ever from the vision of men."</p>
<p>The thing was so fine and generous and knightly <lb/>
that it brought the moisture to his eyes. Presently he <lb/>
said to himself: "What to do is as plain as day now. <lb/>
My Lord Berkeley is dead&#x2014;let him stay so. Died <lb/>
creditably, too; that will make the calamity the easier for <lb/>
my father. And I don't have to report to the Ameri- <lb/>
<pb n="59"/>
can Claimant now. Yes, nothing could be better than <lb/>
the way matters have turned out. I have only to <lb/>
furnish myself with a new name, and take my new <lb/>
start in life totally untrammeled. Now I breathe my <lb/>
first breath of real freedom; and how fresh and breezy <lb/>
and inspiring it is! At last I am a man! a man on <lb/>
equal terms with my neighbor; and by my manhood, <lb/>
and by it alone, I shall rise and be seen of the world, <lb/>
or I shall sink from sight and deserve it. This <i>is</i> the <lb/>
gladdest day, and the proudest, that ever poured its <lb/>
sun upon my head!"</p>
</div2>

<head><b>CHAPTER VIII.</b></head>
<p>"<smcap>God</smcap> bless my soul, Hawkins!"</p>
<p>The morning paper dropped from the Col- <lb/>
onel's nerveless grasp.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"He's gone!&#x2014;the bright, the young, the gifted, <lb/>
the noblest of his illustrious race&#x2014;gone! gone up in <lb/>
flames and unimaginable glory!"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"My precious, precious young kinsman&#x2014;Kirkcud- <lb/>
bright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley, <lb/>
son and heir of usurping Rossmore."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"It is true&#x2014;too true."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Last night."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Right here in Washington, where he arrived from <lb/>
England last night, the papers say."</p>
<p>"You don't say!"</p>
<p>"Hotel burned down."</p>
<p>"What hotel?"</p>
<p>"The New Gadsby!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my goodness! And have we lost <i>both</i> of <lb/>
them?"</p>
<p>"Both <i>who?</i>"</p>
<p>"One-Arm Pete."</p>
<p>"Oh, great guns! I forgot all about him. Oh, I <lb/>
hope not!"</p>
<pb n="61"/>
<p>"Hope! Well, I should say! Oh, we <i>can't</i> spare <lb/>
<i>him!</i> We can better afford to lose a million viscounts <lb/>
than our only support and stay."</p>
<p>They searched the paper diligently, and were ap- <lb/>
palled to find that a one-armed man had been seen <lb/>
flying along one of the halls of the hotel in his under- <lb/>
clothing and apparently out of his head with fright, <lb/>
and as he would listen to no one and persisted in <lb/>
making for a stairway which would carry him to certain <lb/>
death, his case was given over as a hopeless one.</p>
<p>"Poor fellow," sighed Hawkins; "and he had <lb/>
friends so near. I wish we hadn't come away from <lb/>
there&#x2014;maybe we could have saved him."</p>
<p>The earl looked up and said, calmly:</p>
<p>"His being dead doesn't matter. He was uncertain <lb/>
before. We've got him sure, this time."</p>
<p>"Got him? How?"</p>
<p>"I will materialize him."</p>
<p>"Rossmore, don't&#x2014;don't trifle with me. Do you <lb/>
mean that? Can you do it?"</p>
<p>"I can do it, just as sure as you are sitting there. <lb/>
And I will."</p>
<p>"Give me your hand, and let me have the comfort <lb/>
of shaking it. I was perishing, and you have put new <lb/>
life into me. Get at it, oh, get at it right away."</p>
<p>"It will take a little time, Hawkins, but there's no <lb/>
hurry, none in the world&#x2014;in the circumstances. And <lb/>
of course certain duties have devolved upon me now <lb/>
which necessarily claim my first attention. This poor <lb/>
young nobleman&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, I am sorry for my heartlessness, and <lb/>
you smitten with this new family affliction. Of course <lb/>
you must materialize him first&#x2014;I quite understand <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;I&#x2014;well, I wasn't meaning just that, but&#x2014; <lb/>
why, what am I thinking of! Of course I must <lb/>
<pb n="62"/>
materialize him. Oh, Hawkins, selfishness is the bot- <lb/>
tom trait in human nature; I was only thinking that <lb/>
now, with the usurper's heir out of the way&#x2014;But <lb/>
you'll forgive that momentary weakness, and forget it. <lb/>
Don't ever remember it against me that Mulberry Sel- <lb/>
lers was once mean enough to think the thought that I <lb/>
was thinking. I'll materialize him&#x2014;I will, on my <lb/>
honor&#x2014;and I'd do it were he a thousand heirs <lb/>
jammed into one and stretching in a solid rank from <lb/>
here to the stolen estates of Rossmore, and barring the <lb/>
road forever to the rightful earl!"</p>
<p>"There spoke the real Sellers&#x2014;the other had a <lb/>
false ring, old friend."</p>
<p>"Hawkins, my boy, it just occurs to me&#x2014;a thing <lb/>
I keep forgetting to mention&#x2014;a matter that we've got <lb/>
to be mighty careful about."</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"We must keep absolutely still about these material- <lb/>
izations. Mind, not a hint of them must escape&#x2014;not <lb/>
a hint. To say nothing of how my wife and daughter <lb/>
&#x2014;high-strung, sensitive organizations&#x2014;might feel <lb/>
about them, the negroes wouldn't stay on the place a <lb/>
minute."</p>
<p>"That's true, they wouldn't. It's well you spoke, <lb/>
for I'm not naturally discreet with my tongue when <lb/>
I'm not warned."</p>
<p>Sellers reached out and touched a bell button in the <lb/>
wall, set his eye upon the rear door and waited; <lb/>
touched it again and waited; and just as Hawkins was <lb/>
remarking admiringly that the Colonel was the most <lb/>
progressive and most alert man he had ever seen, in <lb/>
the matter of impressing into his service every modern <lb/>
convenience the moment it was invented, and always <lb/>
keeping breast to breast with the drum-major in the <lb/>
great work of material civilization, he forsook the but- <lb/>
ton (which hadn't any wire attached to it), rang a vast <lb/>
<pb n="63"/>
dinner-bell which stood on the table, and remarked that <lb/>
he had tried that new-fangled dry battery now to his <lb/>
entire satisfaction, and had got enough of it; and added:</p>
<p>"Nothing would do Graham Bell but I must try it; <lb/>
said the mere <i>fact</i> of my trying it would secure public <lb/>
confidence, and get it a chance to show what it could <lb/>
do. I <i>told</i> him that in theory a dry battery was just a <lb/>
curled darling and no mistake, but when it come to <lb/>
<i>practice</i>, sho!&#x2014;and here's the result. Was I right? <lb/>
What should <i>you</i> say, Washington Hawkins? You've <lb/>
seen me try that button twice. Was I right?&#x2014;that's <lb/>
the idea. Did I know what I was talking about, or <lb/>
didn't I?"</p>
<p>"Well, you know how I feel about you, Colonel <lb/>
Sellers, and always have felt. It seems to me that you <lb/>
always know everything about <i>every</i>thing. If that <lb/>
man had known you as I know you he would have <lb/>
taken your judgment at the start, and dropped his dry <lb/>
battery where it was."</p>
<p>"Did you ring, Marse Sellers?"</p>
<p>"No, Marse Sellers didn't."</p>
<p>"Den it was you, Marse Washington. I's heah, <lb/>
suh."</p>
<p>"No, it wasn't Marse Washington, either."</p>
<p>"De good lan'! who did ring her, den?"</p>
<p>"Lord Rossmore rang it!"</p>
<p>The old negro flung up his hands and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Blame my skin if I hain't gone en forgit dat name <lb/>
agin! Come heah, Jinny&#x2014;run heah, honey."</p>
<p>Jinny arrived.</p>
<p>"You take dish-yer order de lord gwine to give you. <lb/>
I's gwine down suller and study dat name tell I git it."</p>
<p>"I take de order! Who's yo' nigger las' year? <lb/>
De bell rung for <i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"Dat don't make no diffunce. When a bell ring <lb/>
for anybody, en old marster tell me to&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="64"/>
<p>"Clear out, and settle it in the kitchen!"</p>
<p>The noise of the quarreling presently sank to a mur- <lb/>
mur in the distance, and the earl added: "That's a <lb/>
trouble with old house-servants that were your slaves <lb/>
once and have been your personal friends always."</p>
<p>"Yes, and members of the family."</p>
<p>"Members of the family is just what they become&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>the</i> members of the family, in fact. And sometimes <lb/>
master and mistress of the household. These two are <lb/>
mighty good and loving and faithful and honest, but, <lb/>
hang it, they do just about as they please, they chip <lb/>
into a conversation whenever they want to, and the <lb/>
plain fact is they ought to be killed."</p>
<p>It was a random remark, but it gave him an idea&#x2014; <lb/>
however, nothing could happen without that result.</p>
<p>"What I wanted, Hawkins, was to send for the <lb/>
family and break the news to them."</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind bothering with the servants, then. <lb/>
I will go and bring them down."</p>
<p>While he was gone the earl worked his idea.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said to himself, "when I've got the <lb/>
materializing down to a certainty, I will get Hawkins <lb/>
to kill them, and after that they will be under better <lb/>
control. Without doubt a materialized negro could <lb/>
easily be hypnotized into a state resembling silence. <lb/>
And this could be made permanent&#x2014;yes, and also <lb/>
modifiable, at will&#x2014;sometimes <i>very</i> silent, sometimes <lb/>
turn on more talk, more action, more emotion, accord- <lb/>
ing to what you want. It's a prime good idea. Make <lb/>
it adjustable&#x2014;with a screw or something."</p>
<p>The two ladies entered now with Hawkins, and the <lb/>
two negroes followed, uninvited, and fell to brushing <lb/>
and dusting around, for they perceived that there was <lb/>
matter of interest to the fore, and were willing to find <lb/>
out what it was.</p>
<p>Sellers broke the news with stateliness and ceremony, <lb/>
<pb n="65"/>
first warning the ladies, with gentle art, that a pang of <lb/>
peculiar sharpness was about to be inflicted upon their <lb/>
hearts&#x2014;hearts still sore from a like hurt, still lament- <lb/>
ing a like loss&#x2014;then he took the paper, and with <lb/>
trembling lips and with tears in his voice he gave them <lb/>
that heroic death-picture.</p>
<p>The result was a very genuine outbreak of sorrow <lb/>
and sympathy from all the hearers. The elder lady <lb/>
cried, thinking how proud that great-hearted young <lb/>
hero's mother would be, if she were living, and how <lb/>
unappeasable her grief; and the two old servants cried <lb/>
with her, and spoke out their applauses and their pity- <lb/>
ing lamentations with the eloquent sincerity and sim- <lb/>
plicity native to their race. Gwendolen was touched, <lb/>
and the romantic side of her nature was strongly <lb/>
wrought upon. She said that such a nature as that <lb/>
young man's was rarely and truly noble, and nearly <lb/>
perfect; and that with nobility of birth added it was <lb/>
entirely perfect. For such a man she could endure all <lb/>
things, suffer all things, even to the sacrificing of her <lb/>
life. She wished she could have seen him; the slight- <lb/>
est, the most momentary contact with such a spirit <lb/>
would have ennobled her whole character, and made <lb/>
ignoble thoughts and ignoble acts thereafter impossible <lb/>
to her forever.</p>
<p>"Have they found the body, Rossmore?" asked <lb/>
the wife.</p>
<p>"Yes; that is, they've found several. It must be <lb/>
one of them, but none of them are recognizable."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"I am going down there and identify one of them, <lb/>
and send it home to the stricken father."</p>
<p>"But, papa, did you ever see the young man?"</p>
<p>"No, Gwendolen&#x2014;why?"</p>
<p>"How will you identify it?"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;well, you know, it says none of them are <lb/>
<pb n="66"/>
recognizable. I'll send his father one of them&#x2014; <lb/>
there's probably no choice."</p>
<p>Gwendolen knew it was not worth while to argue the <lb/>
matter further, since her father's mind was made up, <lb/>
and there was a chance for him to appear upon that <lb/>
sad scene down yonder in an authentic and official way. <lb/>
So she said no more&#x2014;till he asked for a basket.</p>
<p>"A basket, papa? What for?"</p>
<p>"It might be ashes."</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> earl and Washington started on the sorrowful <lb/>
errand, talking as they walked.</p>
<p>"And as <i>usual!</i>"</p>
<p>"What, Colonel?"</p>
<p>"Seven of them in that hotel. Actresses. And all <lb/>
burnt out, of course."</p>
<p>"Any of them burnt <i>up?</i>"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, they escaped; they always do; but there's <lb/>
never a one of them that knows enough to fetch out <lb/>
her jewelry with her."</p>
<p>"That's strange."</p>
<p>"Strange&#x2014;it's the most unaccountable thing in <lb/>
the world. Experience teaches them nothing; they <lb/>
can't seem to learn anything except out of a book. <lb/>
In some cases there's manifestly a fatality about it. <lb/>
For instance, take What's-her-name, that plays those <lb/>
sensational thunder and lightning parts. She's got a <lb/>
perfectly immense reputation&#x2014;draws like a dog-fight <lb/>
&#x2014;and it all came from getting burnt out in hotels."</p>
<p>"Why, how could that give her a reputation as an <lb/>
actress?"</p>
<p>"It didn't&#x2014;it only made her name familiar. <lb/>
People want to see her play because her name is <lb/>
familiar, but they don't know what made it familiar, <lb/>
because they don't remember. First, she was at the <lb/>
bottom of the ladder, and absolutely obscure&#x2014;wages <lb/>
thirteen dollars a week and find her own pads."</p>
<pb n="68"/>
<p>"Pads?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;things to fat up her spindles with so as to <lb/>
be plump and attractive. Well, she got burnt out in a <lb/>
hotel and lost &#x0024;30,000 worth of diamonds&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"She? Where'd she get them?"</p>
<p>"Goodness knows&#x2014;given to her, no doubt, by <lb/>
spoony young flats and sappy old baldheads in the <lb/>
front row. All the papers were full of it. She struck <lb/>
for higher pay and got it. Well, she got burnt out <lb/>
again and lost all her diamonds, and it gave her such a <lb/>
lift that she went starring."</p>
<p>"Well, if hotel fires are all she's got to depend on <lb/>
to keep up her name, it's a pretty precarious kind of a <lb/>
reputation, I should think."</p>
<p>"Not with her. No, anything but that. Because <lb/>
she's so lucky; born lucky, I reckon. Every time <lb/>
there's a hotel fire she's in it. She's always there&#x2014; <lb/>
and if she can't be there herself, her diamonds are. <lb/>
Now you can't make anything out of that but just <lb/>
sheer luck."</p>
<p>"I never heard of such a thing. She must have lost <lb/>
quarts of diamonds."</p>
<p>"Quarts! she's lost bushels of them. It's got so <lb/>
that the hotels are superstitious about her. They <lb/>
won't let her in. They think there will be a fire; and, <lb/>
besides, if she's there it cancels the insurance. She's <lb/>
been waning a little lately, but this fire will set her up. <lb/>
She lost &#x0024;60,000 worth last night."</p>
<p>"I think she's a fool. If I had &#x0024;60,000 worth of <lb/>
diamonds I wouldn't trust them in a hotel."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't either; but you can't teach an actress <lb/>
that. This one's been burnt out thirty-five times. <lb/>
And yet if there's a hotel fire in San Francisco to- <lb/>
night she's got to bleed again, you mark my words. <lb/>
Perfect ass; they say she's got diamonds in every <lb/>
hotel in the country."</p>
<pb n="69"/>
<p>When they arrived at the scene of the fire the poor <lb/>
old earl took one glimpse at the melancholy morgue <lb/>
and turned away his face, overcome by the spectacle. <lb/>
He said:</p>
<p>"It is too true, Hawkins&#x2014;recognition is impossi- <lb/>
ble; not one of the five could be identified by its near- <lb/>
est friend. You make the selection; I can't bear it."</p>
<p>"Which one had I better&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, take any of them. Pick out the best one."</p>
<p>However, the officers assured the earl&#x2014;for they <lb/>
knew him, everybody in Washington knew him&#x2014;that <lb/>
the position in which these bodies were found made it <lb/>
impossible that any one of them could be that of his <lb/>
noble young kinsman. They pointed out the spot <lb/>
where, if the newspaper account was correct, he must <lb/>
have sunk down to destruction; and at a wide distance <lb/>
from this spot they showed him where the young man <lb/>
must have gone down in case he was suffocated in his <lb/>
room; and they showed still a third place, quite re- <lb/>
mote, where he might possibly have found his death if <lb/>
perchance he tried to escape by the side exit toward <lb/>
the rear. The old Colonel brushed away a tear, and <lb/>
said to Hawkins:</p>
<p>"As it turns out, there was something prophetic in <lb/>
my fears. Yes, it's a matter of ashes. Will you <lb/>
kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple more <lb/>
baskets?"</p>
<p>Reverently they got a basket of ashes from each of <lb/>
those now hallowed spots, and carried them home to <lb/>
consult as to the best manner of forwarding them to <lb/>
England, and also to give them an opportunity to "lie <lb/>
in state"&#x2014;a mark of respect which the Colonel <lb/>
deemed obligatory, considering the high rank of the <lb/>
deceased.</p>
<p>They set the baskets on the table in what was <lb/>
formerly the library, drawing-room, and work-shop&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="70"/>
now the Hall of Audience&#x2014;and went upstairs to the <lb/>
lumber-room to see if they could find a British flag to <lb/>
use as a part of the outfit proper to the lying in state. <lb/>
A moment later Lady Rossmore came in from the street <lb/>
and caught sight of the baskets just as old Jinny crossed <lb/>
her field of vision. She quite lost her patience, and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Well, what will you do next? What in the world <lb/>
possessed you to clutter up the parlor table with these <lb/>
baskets of ashes?"</p>
<p>"Ashes?" And she came to look. She put up <lb/>
her hands in pathetic astonishment. "Well, I <i>never</i> <lb/>
see de like!"</p>
<p>"Didn't you do it?"</p>
<p>"Who? me? Clah to goodness it's de fust time I've <lb/>
sot eyes on 'em, Miss Polly. Dat's Dan'l. Dat ole <lb/>
moke is losin' his mine."</p>
<p>But it wasn't Dan'l, for he was called, and denied it.</p>
<p>"Dey ain't no way to 'splain dat. Wen hit's one <lb/>
er dese-yer common 'currences, a body kin reckon <lb/>
maybe de cat&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh!" and a shudder shook Lady Rossmore to <lb/>
her foundations. "I see it all. Keep away from <lb/>
them&#x2014;they're <i>his</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>His</i>, m'lady?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;your young Marse Sellers from England <lb/>
that's burnt up."</p>
<p>"She was alone with the ashes&#x2014;alone before she <lb/>
could take half a breath. Then she went after Mul- <lb/>
berry Sellers, purposing to make short work of his <lb/>
programme, whatever it might be; "for," said she, <lb/>
"when his sentimentals are up he's a numskull, and <lb/>
there's no knowing what extravagance he'll contrive if <lb/>
you let him alone." She found him. He had found <lb/>
the flag and was bringing it. When she heard that his <lb/>
idea was to have the remains "lie in state, and invite <lb/>
<pb n="71"/>
the government and the public," she broke it up. She <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Your intentions are all right&#x2014;they always are&#x2014; <lb/>
you want to do honor to the remains, and surely <lb/>
nobody can find any fault with that, for he was your <lb/>
kin; but you are going the wrong way about it, and <lb/>
you will see it yourself if you stop and think. You <lb/>
can't file around a basket of ashes trying to look sorry <lb/>
for it and make a sight that is really solemn, because <lb/>
the solemner it is, the more it isn't&#x2014;anybody can see <lb/>
that. It would be so with one basket; it would be <lb/>
three times so with three. Well, it stands to reason <lb/>
that if it wouldn't be solemn with one mourner, it <lb/>
wouldn't be with a procession&#x2014;and there would be <lb/>
five thousand people here. I don't know but it would <lb/>
be pretty near ridiculous; I think it would. No, Mul- <lb/>
berry, they can't lie in state&#x2014;it would be a mistake. <lb/>
Give that up and think of something else."</p>
<p>So he gave it up; and not reluctantly, when he had <lb/>
thought it over and realized how right her instinct was. <lb/>
He concluded to merely sit up with the remains&#x2014;just <lb/>
himself and Hawkins. Even this seemed a doubtful <lb/>
attention to his wife, but she offered no objection, for <lb/>
it was plain that he had a quite honest and simple- <lb/>
hearted desire to do the friendly and honorable thing <lb/>
by these forlorn poor relics which could command no <lb/>
hospitality in this far-off land of strangers but his. He <lb/>
draped the flag about the baskets, put some crape on <lb/>
the doorknob, and said, with satisfaction:</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;he is as comfortable now as we can make <lb/>
him in the circumstances. Except&#x2014;yes, we must <lb/>
strain a point there&#x2014;one must do as one would wish <lb/>
to be done by&#x2014;he must have it."</p>
<p>"Have what, dear?"</p>
<p>"Hatchment."</p>
<p>The wife felt that the house-front was standing about <lb/>
<pb n="72"/>
all it could well stand in that way; the prospect of <lb/>
another stunning decoration of that nature distressed <lb/>
her, and she wished the thing had not occurred to him. <lb/>
She said, hesitatingly:</p>
<p>"But I thought such an honor as that wasn't allowed <lb/>
to any but very <i>very</i> near relations, who&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Right, you are quite right, my lady, perfectly <lb/>
right; but there aren't any nearer relatives than relatives <lb/>
by usurpation. We cannot avoid it; we are slaves of <lb/>
aristocratic custom, and must submit."</p>
<p>The hatchments were unnecessarily generous, each <lb/>
being as large as a blanket, and they were unnecessarily <lb/>
volcanic, too, as to variety and violence of color, but <lb/>
they pleased the earl's barbaric eye, and they satisfied <lb/>
his taste for symmetry and completeness, too, for they <lb/>
left no waste room to speak of on the house-front.</p>
<p>Lady Rossmore and her daughter assisted at the <lb/>
sitting-up till near midnight, and helped the gentlemen <lb/>
to consider what ought to be done next with the re- <lb/>
mains. Rossmore thought they ought to be sent <lb/>
home&#x2014;with a committee and resolutions&#x2014;at once. <lb/>
But the wife was doubtful. She said:</p>
<p>"Would you send all of the baskets?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, all."</p>
<p>"All at once?"</p>
<p>"To his father? Oh, no&#x2014;by no means. Think <lb/>
of the shock. No&#x2014;one at a time; break it to him <lb/>
by degrees."</p>
<p>"Would <i>that</i> have that effect, father?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my daughter. Remember, you are young <lb/>
and elastic, but he is old. To send him the whole at <lb/>
once might well be more than he could bear. But <lb/>
mitigated&#x2014;one basket at a time, with restful intervals <lb/>
between, he would be used to it by the time he got all <lb/>
of him. And sending him in three ships is safer any- <lb/>
way. On account of wrecks and storms."</p>
<pb n="73"/>
<p>"I don't like the idea, father. If I were his father <lb/>
it would be dreadful to have him coming in that&#x2014;in <lb/>
that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"On the installment plan," suggested Hawkins; <lb/>
gravely, and proud of being able to help.</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;dreadful to have him coming in that inco- <lb/>
herent way. There would be the strain of suspense <lb/>
upon me all the time. To have so depressing a thing <lb/>
as a funeral impending, delayed, waiting, unaccom- <lb/>
plished&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, my child," said the earl, reassuringly, <lb/>
"there would be nothing of that kind; so old a gentle- <lb/>
man could not endure a long-drawn suspense like that. <lb/>
There will be three funerals."</p>
<p>Lady Rossmore looked up surprised, and said:</p>
<p>"How is <i>that</i> going to make it easier for him? It's <lb/>
a total mistake, to my mind. He ought to be buried <lb/>
all at once; I'm sure of it."</p>
<p>"I should think so, too," said Hawkins.</p>
<p>"And certainly <i>I</i> should," said the daughter.</p>
<p>"You are all wrong," said the earl. "You will see <lb/>
it yourselves if you think. Only one of these baskets <lb/>
has got him in it."</p>
<p>"Very well, then," said Lady Rossmore, "the <lb/>
thing is perfectly simple&#x2014;bury <i>that</i> one."</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Lady Gwendolen.</p>
<p>"But it is <i>not</i> simple," said the earl, "because we <lb/>
do not know which basket he is in. We know he is in <lb/>
<i>one</i> of them, but that is all we <i>do</i> know. You see now, <lb/>
I reckon, that I was right; it takes three funerals, there <lb/>
is no other way."</p>
<p>"And three graves and three monuments and three <lb/>
inscriptions?" asked the daughter.</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;yes&#x2014;to do it right. That is what I <lb/>
should do."</p>
<p>"It could not be done so, father. Each of the in- <lb/>
<pb n="74"/>
scriptions would give the same name and the same facts <lb/>
and say he was under each and all of these monuments, <lb/>
and that would not answer at all."</p>
<p>The earl nestled uncomfortably in his chair.</p>
<p>"No," he said, "that <i>is</i> an objection. That is a <lb/>
serious objection. I see no way out."</p>
<p>There was a general silence for a while. Then <lb/>
Hawkins said:</p>
<p>"It seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifica- <lb/>
tions together&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The earl grasped him by the hand and shook it <lb/>
gratefully.</p>
<p>"It solves the whole problem," he said. "One <lb/>
ship, one funeral, one grave, one monument&#x2014;it is <lb/>
admirably conceived. It does you honor, Major Haw- <lb/>
kins, it has relieved me of a most painful embarrass- <lb/>
ment and distress, and it will save that poor stricken <lb/>
old father much suffering. Yes, he shall go over in <lb/>
one basket."</p>
<p>"When?" asked the wife.</p>
<p>"To-morrow&#x2014;immediately, of course."</p>
<p>"I would wait, Mulberry."</p>
<p>"Wait? Why?"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> don't want to break that childless old man's <lb/>
heart."</p>
<p>"God knows I don't."</p>
<p>"Then wait till he sends for his son's remains. If <lb/>
you do that you will never have to give him the last <lb/>
and sharpest pain a parent can know&#x2014;I mean, the <lb/>
<i>certainty</i> that his son is dead. For he will never <lb/>
send."</p>
<p>"Why won't he?"</p>
<p>"Because to send&#x2014;and find out the truth&#x2014;would <lb/>
rob him of the one precious thing left him: the <i>uncer- <lb/>
tainty</i>, the dim hope that maybe, after all, his boy <lb/>
escaped, and he will see him again some day."</p>
<pb n="75"/>
<p>"Why, Polly, he'll know by the <i>papers</i> that he was <lb/>
burnt up."</p>
<p>"He won't let himself <i>believe</i> the papers; he'll <lb/>
argue against anything and everything that proves his <lb/>
son is dead; and he will keep that up and live on it, <lb/>
and on nothing else till he dies. But if the <i>remains</i> <lb/>
should actually come, and be put before that poor old <lb/>
dim-hoping soul&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, my God, they never shall! Polly, you've <lb/>
saved me from a crime, and I'll bless you for it always. <lb/>
<i>Now</i> we know what to do. We'll place them reverently <lb/>
away, and he shall never know."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER X.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> young Lord Berkeley, with the fresh air of <lb/>
freedom in his nostrils, was feeling invincibly <lb/>
strong for his new career; and yet&#x2014;and yet&#x2014;if the <lb/>
fight should prove a very hard one at first, very dis- <lb/>
couraging, very taxing on untoughened moral sinews, <lb/>
he might in some weak moment want to retreat. Not <lb/>
likely, of course, but possibly that might happen. <lb/>
And so, on the whole, it might be pardonable caution <lb/>
to burn his bridges behind him. Oh, without doubt. <lb/>
He must not stop with advertising for the owner of that <lb/>
money, but must put it where he could not borrow <lb/>
from it himself, meantime, under stress of circum- <lb/>
stances. So he went down town and put in his adver- <lb/>
tisement, then went to a bank and handed in &#x0024;500 for <lb/>
deposit.</p>
<p>"What name?"</p>
<p>He hesitated and colored a little; he had forgotten <lb/>
to make a selection. He now brought out the first <lb/>
one that suggested itself:</p>
<p>"Howard Tracy."</p>
<p>When he was gone, the clerks, marveling, said:</p>
<p>"The cowboy blushed."</p>
<p>The first step was accomplished. The money was <lb/>
still under his command and at his disposal, but the <lb/>
next step would dispose of that difficulty. He went to <lb/>
another bank and drew upon the first bank for the <lb/>
&#x0024;500 by check. The money was collected and de- <lb/>
<pb n="77"/>
posited a second time to the credit of Howard Tracy. <lb/>
He was asked to leave a few samples of his signature, <lb/>
which he did. Then he went away, once more proud <lb/>
and of perfect courage, saying:</p>
<p>"No help for me now, for henceforth I couldn't <lb/>
draw that money without identification, and that is be- <lb/>
come legally impossible. No resources to fall back <lb/>
on. It is work or starve from now to the end. I am <lb/>
ready&#x2014;and not afraid!"</p>
<p>Then he sent this cablegram to his father: <lb/>
<q>Escaped unhurt from burning hotel. Have taken fictitious name. <lb/>
Good-bye.</q></p>
<p>During the evening, while he was wandering about in <lb/>
one of the outlying districts of the city, he came across <lb/>
a small brick church, with a bill posted there with these <lb/>
words printed on it: "<smcap>Mechanics' Club Debate. <lb/>
All Invited</smcap>." He saw people, apparently mainly <lb/>
of the working class, entering the place, and he fol- <lb/>
lowed and took his seat. It was a humble little church, <lb/>
quite bare as to ornamentation. It had painted pews <lb/>
without cushions, and no pulpit, properly speaking, <lb/>
but it had a platform. On the platform sat the chair- <lb/>
man, and by his side sat a man who held a manuscript <lb/>
in his hand and had the waiting look of one who is <lb/>
going to perform the principal part. The church was <lb/>
soon filled with a quiet and orderly congregation of <lb/>
decently dressed and modest people. This is what the <lb/>
chairman said:</p>
<p>"The essayist for this evening is an old member of <lb/>
our club whom you all know, Mr. Parker, assistant <lb/>
editor of the <i>Daily Democrat</i>. The subject of his essay <lb/>
is the American Press, and he will use as his text a <lb/>
couple of paragraphs taken from Mr. Matthew Arnold's <lb/>
new book. He asks me to read these texts for him. <lb/>
The first is as follows: <lb/>
<pb n="78"/>
<q>"Goethe says somewhere that 'the thrill of awe,' that is to say, <lb/>
<smcap>reverence</smcap>, is the best thing humanity has.</q></p>
<p>"Mr. Arnold's other paragraph is as follows: <lb/>
<q>"I should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface <lb/>
and kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect, one could not do better <lb/>
than take the American newspapers."</q></p>
<p>Mr. Parker rose and bowed, and was received with <lb/>
warm applause. He then began to read in a good, <lb/>
round, resonant voice, with clear enunciation and care- <lb/>
ful attention to his pauses and emphases. His points <lb/>
were received with approval as he went on.</p>
<p>The essayist took the position that the most important <lb/>
function of a public journal in any country was the <lb/>
propagating of national feeling and pride in the national <lb/>
name&#x2014;the keeping the people "in love with <i>their</i> <lb/>
country and <i>its</i> institutions, and shielded from the <lb/>
allurements of alien and inimical systems." He <lb/>
sketched the manner in which the reverent Turkish or <lb/>
Russian journalist fulfilled this function&#x2014;the one <lb/>
assisted by the prevalent "discipline of respect" for <lb/>
the bastinado, the other for Siberia. Continuing, he <lb/>
said: <lb/>
<q>The chief function of an English journal is that of all other journals the <lb/>
world over: it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon certain things, <lb/>
and keep it diligently diverted from certain others. For instance, it must <lb/>
keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon the glories of England, a pro- <lb/>
cessional splendor stretching its receding line down the hazy vistas of time, <lb/>
with the mellowed lights of a thousand years glinting from its banners; and <lb/>
it must keep it diligently diverted from the fact that all these glories were <lb/>
for the enrichment and aggrandizement of the petted and privileged few, at <lb/>
cost of the blood and sweat and poverty of the unconsidered masses who <lb/>
achieved them, but might not enter in and partake of them. It must keep <lb/>
the public eye fixed in loving and awful reverence upon the throne as a <lb/>
sacred thing, and diligently divert it from the fact that no throne was ever <lb/>
set up by the unhampered vote of a majority of any nation; and that <lb/>
hence no throne exists that has a right to exist, and no symbol of it, flying <lb/>
<pb n="79"/>
from any flagstaff, is righteously entitled to wear any device but the skull <lb/>
and crossbones of that kindred industry which differs from royalty only <lb/>
business-wise&#x2014;merely as retail differs from wholesale. It must keep the <lb/>
citizen's eye fixed in reverent docility upon that curious invention of machine <lb/>
politics, an Established Church, and upon that bald contradiction of com- <lb/>
mon justice, a hereditary nobility; and diligently divert it from the fact <lb/>
that the one damns him if he doesn't wear its collar, and robs him under <lb/>
the gentle name of taxation whether he wears it or not, and the other gets <lb/>
all the honors while he does all the work.</q></p>
<p>The essayist thought that Mr. Arnold, with his <lb/>
trained eye and intelligent observation, ought to have <lb/>
perceived that the very quality which he so regretfully <lb/>
missed from our press&#x2014;respectfulness, reverence&#x2014; <lb/>
was exactly the thing which would make our press <lb/>
useless to us if it had it&#x2014;rob it of the very thing <lb/>
which differentiates it from all other journalism in the <lb/>
world and makes it distinctively and preciously Ameri- <lb/>
can, its frank and cheerful irreverence being by all <lb/>
odds the most valuable of all its qualities. "For its <lb/>
mission&#x2014;overlooked by Mr. Arnold&#x2014;is to stand <lb/>
guard over a nation's liberties, not its humbugs and <lb/>
shams." He thought that if during fifty years the <lb/>
institutions of the old world could be exposed to the <lb/>
fire of a flouting and scoffing press like ours, "mon- <lb/>
archy and its attendant crimes would disappear from <lb/>
Christendom." Monarchists might doubt this; then <lb/>
"why not persuade the Czar to give it a trial in <lb/>
Russia?" Concluding, he said: <lb/>
<q>Well, the charge is, that our press has but little of that old world <lb/>
quality, reverence. Let us be candidly grateful that it is so. With its <lb/>
limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation reveres, as <lb/>
a rule, and that is sufficient: what other people revere is fairly and properly <lb/>
matter of light importance to us. Our press does not reverence kings, it <lb/>
does not reverence so-called nobilities; it does not reverence established <lb/>
ecclesiastical slaveries, it does not reverence laws which rob a younger son <lb/>
to fatten an elder one, it does not reverence any fraud or sham or infamy, <lb/>
howsoever old or rotten or holy, which sets one citizen above his neighbor <lb/>
<pb n="80"/>
by accident of birth; it does not reverence any law or custom, howsoever <lb/>
old or decayed or sacred, which shuts against the best man in the land the <lb/>
best place in the land and the divine right to prove property and go up and <lb/>
occupy it. In the sense of the poet Goethe&#x2014;that meek idolater of pro- <lb/>
vincial three carat royalty and nobility&#x2014;our press is certainly bankrupt in <lb/>
the "thrill of awe"&#x2014;otherwise reverence; reverence for nickel plate and <lb/>
brummagem. Let us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact for- <lb/>
ever; for to my mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and pro- <lb/>
tector of human liberty&#x2014;even as the other thing is the creator, nurse, and <lb/>
steadfast protector of all forms of human slavery, bodily and mental.</q></p>
<p>Tracy said to himself, almost shouted to himself, <lb/>
"I'm glad I came to this country. I was right. I <lb/>
was right to seek out a land where such healthy prin- <lb/>
ciples and theories are in men's hearts and minds. <lb/>
Think of the innumerable slaveries imposed by mis- <lb/>
placed reverence! How well he brought that out, and <lb/>
how true it is. There's manifestly prodigious force in <lb/>
reverence. If you can get a man to reverence your <lb/>
ideals, he's your slave. Oh, yes; in all the ages the <lb/>
peoples of Europe have been diligently taught to avoid <lb/>
reasoning about the shams of monarchy and nobility, <lb/>
been taught to avoid examining them, been taught to <lb/>
reverence them; and now, as a natural result, to rever- <lb/>
ence them is a second nature. In order to shock them <lb/>
it is sufficient to inject a thought of the opposite kind <lb/>
into their dull minds. For ages, any expression of so- <lb/>
called irreverence from their lips has been sin and <lb/>
crime. The sham and swindle of all this is apparent <lb/>
the moment one reflects that he is himself the only <lb/>
legitimately qualified judge of what <i>is</i> entitled to rever- <lb/>
ence and what is not. Come, I hadn't thought of that <lb/>
before, but it is true, absolutely true. What right has <lb/>
Goethe, what right has Arnold, what right has any dic- <lb/>
tionary, to define the word Irreverence for me? What <lb/>
their ideals are is nothing to me. So long as I rever- <lb/>
ence my own ideals my whole duty is done, and I <lb/>
<pb n="81"/>
commit no profanation if I laugh at theirs. I may <lb/>
scoff at other people's ideals as much as I want to. It <lb/>
is my right and my privilege. No man has any right <lb/>
to deny it."</p>
<p>Tracy was expecting to hear the essay debated, but <lb/>
this did not happen. The chairman said, by way of <lb/>
explanation:</p>
<p>"I would say, for the information of the strangers <lb/>
present here, that in accordance with our custom the <lb/>
subject of this meeting will be debated at the next <lb/>
meeting of the club. This is in order to enable our <lb/>
members to prepare what they may wish to say upon <lb/>
the subject with pen and paper, for we are mainly <lb/>
mechanics and unaccustomed to speaking. We are <lb/>
obliged to write down what we desire to say."</p>
<p>Many brief papers were now read, and several off- <lb/>
hand speeches made in discussion of the essay read at <lb/>
the last meeting of the club, which had been a lauda- <lb/>
tion, by some visiting professor, of college culture, and <lb/>
the grand results flowing from it to the nation. One <lb/>
of the papers was read by a man approaching middle <lb/>
age, who said he hadn't had a college education, that <lb/>
he had got his education in a printing office, and had <lb/>
graduated from there into the patent office, where he <lb/>
had been a clerk now for a great many years. Then <lb/>
he continued to this effect: <lb/>
<q>The essayist contrasted the America of to-day with the America of <lb/>
bygone times, and certainly the result is the exhibition of a mighty progress. <lb/>
But I think he a little overrated the college-culture share in the production <lb/>
of that result. It can no doubt be easily shown that the colleges have con- <lb/>
tributed the intellectual part of this progress, and that that part is vast; but <lb/>
that the material progress has been immeasurably vaster, I think you will <lb/>
concede. Now I have been looking over a list of inventors&#x2014;the creators <lb/>
of this amazing material development&#x2014;and I find that they were not <lb/>
college-bred men. Of course there are exceptions&#x2014;like Professor Henry <lb/>
of Princeton, the inventor of Mr. Morse's system of telegraphy&#x2014;but these <lb/>
<pb n="82"/>
exceptions are few. It is not overstatement to say that the imagination- <lb/>
stunning material development of this century, the only century worth <lb/>
living in since time itself was invented, is the creation of men not college- <lb/>
bred. We think we see what these inventors have done: no, we see only <lb/>
the visible vast frontage of their work; behind it is their far vaster work, <lb/>
and it is invisible to the careless glance. They have reconstructed this <lb/>
nation&#x2014;made it over, that is&#x2014;and, metaphorically speaking, have multi- <lb/>
plied its numbers almost beyond the power of figures to express. I will <lb/>
explain what I mean. What constitutes the population of a land? Merely <lb/>
the numberable packages of meat and bones in it called by courtesy men and <lb/>
women? Shall a million ounces of brass and a million ounces of gold be <lb/>
held to be of the same value? Take a truer standard: the measure of a <lb/>
man's contributing capacity to his time and his people&#x2014;the work he can <lb/>
do&#x2014;and then number the population of this country to-day, as multiplied <lb/>
by what a man can now do more than his grandfather could do. By this <lb/>
standard of measurement, this nation, two or three generations ago, con- <lb/>
sisted of mere cripples, paralytics, dead men, as compared with the men of <lb/>
to-day. In 1840 our population was 17,000,000. By the way of rude but <lb/>
striking illustration, let us consider, for argument's sake, that four of these <lb/>
millions consisted of aged people, little children, and other incapables, and <lb/>
that the remaining 13,000,000 were divided and employed as follows:</q>
<list>
<item>2,000,000 as ginners of cotton.</item>
<item>6,000,000 (women) as stocking-knitters.</item>
<item>2,000,000 (women) as thread-spinners.</item>
<item>500,000 as screw-makers.</item>
<item>400,000 as reapers, binders, etc.</item>
<item>1,000,000 as corn-shellers.</item>
<item>40,000 as weavers.</item>
<item>1,000 as stitchers of shoe soles.</item>
</list>
<q>Now the deductions which I am going to append to these figures may <lb/>
sound extravagant, but they are not. I take them from Miscellaneous <lb/>
Documents No. 50, second session 45th Congress, and they are official and <lb/>
trustworthy. To-day the work of those 2,000,000 cotton-ginners is done <lb/>
by 2,000 men; that of the 6,000,000 stocking-knitters is done by 3,000 <lb/>
boys; that of the 2,000,000 thread-spinners is done by 1,000 girls; that of <lb/>
the 500,000 screw-makers is done by 500 girls; that of the 400,000 reapers, <lb/>
binders, etc., is done by 4,000 boys; that of the 1,000,000 corn-shellers is <lb/>
done by 7,500 men; that of the 40,000 weavers is done by 1,200 men, and <lb/>
that of the 1,000 stitchers of shoe soles is done by 6 men. To bunch the <lb/>
figures, 17,000 persons to-day do the above work, whereas fifty years ago it <lb/>
<pb n="83"/>
would have taken thirteen millions of persons to do it. Now then, how <lb/>
many of that ignorant race&#x2014;our fathers and grandfathers&#x2014;with their <lb/>
ignorant methods, would it take to do our work to-day? It would take <lb/>
forty thousand millions&#x2014;a hundred times the swarming population of <lb/>
China&#x2014;twenty times the present population of the globe. You look <lb/>
around you and you see a nation of sixty millions&#x2014;apparently; but secreted <lb/>
in their hands and brains, and invisible to your eyes, is the true population <lb/>
of this Republic, and it numbers forty billions! It is the stupendous <lb/>
creation of those humble, unlettered, un-college-bred inventors&#x2014;all honor <lb/>
to their name.</q></p>
<p>"How grand that is!" said Tracy, as he wended <lb/>
homeward. "What a civilization it is, and what pro- <lb/>
digious results these are! and brought about almost <lb/>
wholly by common men; not by Oxford-trained aristo- <lb/>
crats, but men who stand shoulder to shoulder in the <lb/>
humble ranks of life and earn the bread that they eat. <lb/>
Again, I'm glad I came. I have found a country at <lb/>
last where one may start fair, and, breast to breast with <lb/>
his fellow-man, rise by his own efforts, and be some- <lb/>
thing in the world and be proud of that something; <lb/>
not be something created by an ancestor three hundred <lb/>
years ago."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>During</smcap> the first few days he kept the fact diligently <lb/>
before his mind that he was in a land where there <lb/>
was "work and bread for all." In fact, for con- <lb/>
venience's sake he fitted it to a little tune and hummed <lb/>
it to himself; but as time wore on the fact itself began <lb/>
to take on a doubtful look, and next the tune got <lb/>
fatigued and presently ran down and stopped. His <lb/>
first effort was to get an upper clerkship in one of the <lb/>
departments, where his Oxford education could come <lb/>
into play and do him service. But he stood no chance <lb/>
whatever. There competency was no recommenda- <lb/>
tion; political backing, without competency, was worth <lb/>
six of it. He was glaringly English, and that was <lb/>
necessarily against him in the political center of a <lb/>
nation where both parties prayed for the Irish cause on <lb/>
the house-top and blasphemed it in the cellar. By his <lb/>
dress he was a cowboy; that won him respect&#x2014;when <lb/>
his back was not turned&#x2014;but it couldn't get a clerk- <lb/>
ship for him. But he had said, in a rash moment, that <lb/>
he would wear those clothes till the owner or the <lb/>
owner's friends caught sight of them and asked for that <lb/>
money, and his conscience would not let him retire <lb/>
from that engagement now.</p>
<p>At the end of a week things were beginning to wear <lb/>
rather a startling look. He had hunted everywhere <lb/>
for work, descending gradually the scale of quality, <lb/>
until apparently he had sued for all the various kinds <lb/>
<pb n="85"/>
of work a man without a special calling might hope <lb/>
to be able to do, except ditching and the other <lb/>
coarse manual sorts&#x2014;and had got neither work nor <lb/>
the promise of it.</p>
<p>He was mechanically turning over the leaves of his <lb/>
diary meanwhile, and now his eye fell upon the first <lb/>
record made after he was burnt out: <lb/>
<q>I myself did not doubt my stamina before; nobody could doubt it now, <lb/>
if they could see how I am housed, and realize that I feel absolutely no <lb/>
disgust with these quarters, but am as serenely content with them as any <lb/>
dog would be in a similar kennel. Terms, twenty-five dollars a week. I <lb/>
said I would start at the bottom. I have kept my word.</q></p>
<p>A shudder went quaking through him, and he ex- <lb/>
claimed:</p>
<p>"What have I been thinking of! <i>This</i> the bottom! <lb/>
Mooning along a whole week, and these terrific ex- <lb/>
penses climbing and climbing all the time! I must end <lb/>
this folly straightway."</p>
<p>He settled up at once and went forth to find less <lb/>
sumptuous lodgings. He had to wander far and seek <lb/>
with diligence, but he succeeded. They made him pay <lb/>
in advance&#x2014;four dollars and a half; this secured <lb/>
both bed and food for a week. The good-natured, <lb/>
hard-worked landlady took him up three flights of <lb/>
narrow, uncarpeted stairs and delivered him into his <lb/>
room. There were two double bedsteads in it and <lb/>
one single one. He would be allowed to sleep alone <lb/>
in one of the double beds until some new boarder <lb/>
should come, but he wouldn't be charged extra.</p>
<p>So he would presently be required to sleep with some <lb/>
stranger! The thought of it made him sick. Mrs. <lb/>
Marsh, the landlady, was very friendly, and hoped he <lb/>
would like her house&#x2014;they all liked it, she said.</p>
<p>"And they're a very nice set of boys. They carry <lb/>
on a good deal, but that's their fun. You see, this <lb/>
<pb n="86"/>
room opens right into this back one, and sometimes <lb/>
they're all in one and sometimes in the other; and hot <lb/>
nights they all sleep on the roof when it don't rain. <lb/>
They get out there the minute it's hot enough. The <lb/>
season's so early that they've already had a night or <lb/>
two up there. If you'd like to go up and pick out a <lb/>
place, you can. You'll find chalk in the side of the <lb/>
chimney where there's a brick wanting. You just take <lb/>
the chalk and&#x2014;but, of course, you've done it before."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I haven't."</p>
<p>"Why, of course, you haven't&#x2014;what am I think- <lb/>
ing of? Plenty of room on the Plains without chalk- <lb/>
ing, I'll be bound. Well, you just chalk out a place <lb/>
the size of a blanket anywhere on the tin that ain't <lb/>
already marked off, you know, and that's your prop- <lb/>
erty. You and your bed-mate take turn-about carry- <lb/>
ing up the blanket and pillows and fetching them down <lb/>
again; or one carries them up and the other fetches <lb/>
them down; you fix it the way you like, you know. <lb/>
You'll like the boys; they're everlasting sociable&#x2014; <lb/>
except the printer. He's the one that sleeps in that <lb/>
single bed&#x2014;the strangest creature; why, I don't be- <lb/>
lieve you could get that man to sleep with another <lb/>
man, not if the house was afire. Mind you, I'm not <lb/>
just talking, I <i>know</i>. The boys tried him to see. <lb/>
They took his bed out one night, and so when he got <lb/>
home about three in the morning&#x2014;he was on a morn- <lb/>
ing paper then, but he's on an evening one now&#x2014; <lb/>
there wasn't any place for him but with the iron <lb/>
moulder; and if you'll believe me, he just set up the <lb/>
rest of the night&#x2014;he did, honest. They say he's <lb/>
cracked, but it ain't so, he's English&#x2014;they're awful <lb/>
particular. You won't mind my saying that. You&#x2014; <lb/>
you're English?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I thought so. I could tell it by the way you mis- <lb/>
<pb n="87"/>
pronounce the words that's got <i>a</i>'s in them, you know; <lb/>
such as say loff when you mean laff&#x2014;but you'll get <lb/>
over that. He's a right down good fellow, and a little <lb/>
sociable with the photographer's boy and the caulker <lb/>
and the blacksmith that work in the navy yard, but not <lb/>
so much with the others. The fact is, though it's <lb/>
private, and the others don't know it, he's a kind of <lb/>
an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and <i>you</i> know <lb/>
what style <i>that</i> is&#x2014;in England, I mean, because in <lb/>
this country a doctor ain't so <i>very</i> much, even if he's <lb/>
<i>that</i>. But over there, of course, it's different. So <lb/>
this chap had a falling out with his father, and was <lb/>
pretty high strung, and just cut for this country, and <lb/>
the first he knew he had to get to work or starve. <lb/>
Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged <lb/>
<i>he</i> was all right&#x2014;did you say anything?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;I only sighed."</p>
<p>"And there's where he was mistaken. Why, he <lb/>
mighty near starved. And I reckon he would have <lb/>
starved sure enough if some jour' printer or other <lb/>
hadn't took pity on him and got him a place as ap- <lb/>
prentice. So he learned the trade, and then he was all <lb/>
right&#x2014;but it was a close call. Once he thought he <lb/>
had <i>got</i> to haul in his pride and holler for his father, <lb/>
and&#x2014;why, you're sighing again. Is anything the <lb/>
matter with you?&#x2014;does my clatter&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>dear</i>-no. Pray go on&#x2014;I like it."</p>
<p>"Yes, you see, he's been over here ten years; he's <lb/>
twenty-eight now, and he ain't pretty well satisfied in <lb/>
his mind, because he can't get reconciled to being a <lb/>
mechanic and associating with mechanics, he being, as <lb/>
he says to me, a <i>gentleman</i>, which is a pretty plain <lb/>
letting-on that the boys ain't, but of course I know <lb/>
enough not to let <i>that</i> cat out of the bag."</p>
<p>"Why&#x2014;would there be any harm in it?"</p>
<p>"Harm in it? They'd lick him, wouldn't they? <lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
Wouldn't <i>you?</i> Of course you would. Don't you ever <lb/>
let a man say you ain't a gentleman in <i>this</i> country. <lb/>
But laws, what am I thinking about? I reckon a body <lb/>
would think twice before he said a cowboy wasn't a <lb/>
gentleman."</p>
<p>A trim, active, slender, and very pretty girl of <lb/>
about eighteen walked into the room now, in the most <lb/>
satisfied and unembarrassed way. She was cheaply <lb/>
but smartly and gracefully dressed, and the mother's <lb/>
quick glance at the stranger's face as he rose was of <lb/>
the kind which inquires what effect has been produced, <lb/>
and expects to find indications of surprise and admira- <lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>"This is my daughter Hattie&#x2014;we call her Puss. <lb/>
It's the new boarder, Puss." This without rising.</p>
<p>The young Englishman made the awkward bow <lb/>
common to his nationality and time of life in circum- <lb/>
stances of delicacy and difficulty, and these were of <lb/>
that sort; for, being taken by surprise, his natural, <lb/>
lifelong self sprang to the front, and that self, of <lb/>
course, would not know just how to act when intro- <lb/>
duced to a chambermaid, or to the heiress of a <lb/>
mechanics' boarding house. His other self&#x2014;the self <lb/>
which recognized the equality of all men&#x2014;would have <lb/>
managed the thing better if it hadn't been caught off <lb/>
guard and robbed of its chance. The young girl paid <lb/>
no attention to the bow, but put out her hand frankly <lb/>
and gave the stranger a friendly shake, and said:</p>
<p>"How do you do?"</p>
<p>Then she marched to the one washstand in the <lb/>
room, tilted her head this way and that before the <lb/>
wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it, dampened <lb/>
her fingers with her tongue, perfected the circle of a <lb/>
little lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, <lb/>
then began to busy herself with the slops.</p>
<p>"Well, I must be going&#x2014;it's getting toward supper <lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
time. Make yourself at home, Mr. Tracy; you'll hear <lb/>
the bell when it's ready."</p>
<p>The landlady took her tranquil departure without <lb/>
commanding either of the young people to vacate the <lb/>
room. The young man wondered a little that a mother <lb/>
who seemed so honest and respectable should be so <lb/>
thoughtless, and was reaching for his hat, intending to <lb/>
disembarrass the girl of his presence; but she said:</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;nowhere in particular, but as I am only in <lb/>
the way here&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, who said you were in the way? Sit down&#x2014; <lb/>
I'll move you when you are in the way."</p>
<p>She was making the beds now. He sat down and <lb/>
watched her deft and diligent performance.</p>
<p>"What gave you that notion? Do you reckon I <lb/>
need a whole room just to make up a bed or two in?"</p>
<p>"Well, no, it wasn't that, exactly. We are away <lb/>
up here in an empty house, and your mother being <lb/>
gone&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The girl interrupted him with an amused laugh, and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Nobody to protect me? Bless you, I don't need <lb/>
it. I'm not afraid. I might be if I was alone, because <lb/>
I do hate ghosts, and I don't deny it. Not that I <lb/>
believe in them, for I don't. I'm only just afraid of <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>"How can you be afraid of them if you don't be- <lb/>
lieve in them?"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> don't know the <i>how</i> of it&#x2014;that's too many <lb/>
for <i>me;</i> I only know it's <i>so</i>. It's the same with Maggie <lb/>
Lee."</p>
<p>"Who is that?"</p>
<p>"One of the boarders; young lady that works in <lb/>
the factry."</p>
<p>"She works in a factory?"</p>
<pb n="90"/>
<p>"Yes. Shoe factry."</p>
<p>"In a shoe factory; and you call her a young <lb/>
lady?"</p>
<p>"Why, she's only twenty-two; what should you <lb/>
call her?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't thinking of her age; I was thinking of the <lb/>
title. The fact is, I came away from England to get <lb/>
away from artificial forms&#x2014;for artificial forms suit <lb/>
artificial people only&#x2014;and here you've got them, too. <lb/>
I'm sorry. I hoped you had only men and women; <lb/>
everybody equal; no differences in rank."</p>
<p>The girl stopped with a pillow in her teeth and the <lb/>
case spread open below it, contemplating him from <lb/>
under her brows with a slightly puzzled expression. <lb/>
She released the pillow, and said:</p>
<p>"Why, they <i>are</i> all equal. Where's any difference <lb/>
in rank?"</p>
<p>"If you call a factory girl a young <i>lady</i>, what do <lb/>
you call the President's wife?"</p>
<p>"Call her an <i>old</i> one."</p>
<p>"Oh, you make age the only distinction?"</p>
<p>"There ain't any other to make as far as I can see."</p>
<p>"Then <i>all</i> women are ladies?"</p>
<p>"Certainly they are. All the respectable ones."</p>
<p>"Well, that puts a better face on it. Certainly <lb/>
there is no harm in a title when it is given to every- <lb/>
body. It is only an offense and a wrong when it is <lb/>
restricted to a favored few. But Miss&#x2014;er&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Hattie."</p>
<p>"Miss Hattie, be frank; confess that that title <i>isn't</i> <lb/>
accorded by everybody to everybody. The rich <lb/>
American doesn't call her cook a lady&#x2014;isn't that <lb/>
so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's so. What of it?"</p>
<p>He was surprised and a little disappointed to see that <lb/>
his admirable shot had produced no perceptible effect.</p>
<pb n="91"/>
<p>"What <i>of</i> it?" he said. "Why, this: equality is <lb/>
<i>not</i> conceded here, after all, and the Americans are no <lb/>
better off then the English. In fact, there's no differ- <lb/>
ence."</p>
<p>"Now <i>what</i> an idea. There's nothing in a title <lb/>
except what is <i>put</i> into it&#x2014;you've said that yourself. <lb/>
Suppose the title is <i>clean</i>, instead of lady. You get <lb/>
that?"</p>
<p>"I believe so. Instead of speaking of a woman as a <lb/>
<i>lady</i>, you substitute clean and say she's a clean person."</p>
<p>"That's it. In England the swell folks don't speak <lb/>
of the working people as gentlemen and ladies?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no."</p>
<p>"And the working people don't call <i>themselves</i> <lb/>
gentlemen and ladies?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"So if you used the other word there wouldn't be <lb/>
any change. The swell people wouldn't call anybody <lb/>
but themselves 'clean,' and those others would drop <lb/>
sort of meekly into their way of talking and <i>they</i> <lb/>
wouldn't call themselves clean. We don't do that way <lb/>
here. Everybody calls himself a lady or gentleman, <lb/>
and thinks he <i>is</i>, and don't care what anybody else <lb/>
thinks him, so long as he don't say it out loud. You <lb/>
think there's no difference. You <i>knuckle down</i> and <lb/>
we <i>don't</i>. Ain't that a difference?"</p>
<p>"It is a difference I hadn't thought of; I admit that. <lb/>
Still&#x2014;<i>calling</i> one's self a lady doesn't&#x2014;er&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't go on if I were you."</p>
<p>Howard Tracy turned his head to see who it might <lb/>
be that had introduced this remark. It was a short <lb/>
man about forty years old, with sandy hair, no beard, <lb/>
and a pleasant face badly freckled but alive and intelli- <lb/>
gent, and he wore slop-shop clothing which was neat <lb/>
but showed wear. He had come from the front room <lb/>
beyond the hall, where he had left his hat, and he had <lb/>
<pb n="92"/>
a chipped and cracked white wash-bowl in his hand. <lb/>
The girl came and took the bowl.</p>
<p>"I'll get it for you. You go right ahead and <i>give</i> <lb/>
it to him, Mr. Barrow. He's the new boarder&#x2014;Mr. <lb/>
Tracy&#x2014;and I'd just got to where it was getting too <lb/>
deep for me."</p>
<p>"Much obliged if you will, Hattie. I was coming <lb/>
to borrow of the boys." He sat down at his ease on <lb/>
an old trunk, and said, "I've been listening and got <lb/>
interested; and as I was saying, I wouldn't go on if I <lb/>
were you. You see where you are coming to, don't <lb/>
you? <i>Calling</i> yourself a lady doesn't elect you; that <lb/>
is what you were going to say; and you saw that if <lb/>
you said it you were going to run right up against <lb/>
another difference that you hadn't thought of: to wit, <lb/>
Whose <i>right</i> is it to do the electing? Over there, <lb/>
twenty thousand people in a million elect themselves <lb/>
gentleman and ladies, and the nine hundred and eighty <lb/>
thousand <i>accept</i> that decree and swallow the affront <lb/>
which it puts upon them. Why, if they didn't accept <lb/>
it it wouldn't <i>be</i> an election; it would be a dead letter, <lb/>
and have no force at all. Over here the twenty thou- <lb/>
sand would-be exclusives come up to the polls and <lb/>
vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen. But the <lb/>
thing doesn't stop there. The nine hundred and eighty <lb/>
thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and <lb/>
gentlemen <i>too</i>, and that elects the whole nation. Since <lb/>
the whole million vote themselves ladies and gentlemen, <lb/>
there is no question about that election. It <i>does</i> make <lb/>
absolute equality, and there is no fiction about it; <lb/>
while over yonder the <i>inequality</i> (by decree of the <lb/>
infinitely feeble, and consent of the infinitely strong) <lb/>
is also absolute&#x2014;as real and absolute as our equality."</p>
<p>Tracy had shrunk promptly into his English shell <lb/>
when this speech began, notwithstanding he had now <lb/>
been in severe training several weeks for contact and <lb/>
<pb n="93"/>
intercourse with the common herd on the common <lb/>
herd's terms; but he lost no time in pulling himself out <lb/>
again, and so by the time the speech was finished his <lb/>
valves were open once more, and he was forcing him- <lb/>
self to accept without resentment the common herd's <lb/>
frank fashion of dropping sociably into other people's <lb/>
conversations unembarrassed and uninvited. The pro- <lb/>
cess was not very difficult this time, for the man's <lb/>
smile and voice and manner were persuasive and win- <lb/>
ning. Tracy would even have liked him on the spot <lb/>
but for the fact&#x2014;fact which he was not really aware <lb/>
of&#x2014;that the equality of men was not yet a reality to <lb/>
him; it was only a theory; the <i>mind</i> perceived, but <lb/>
the <i>man</i> failed to feel it. It was Hattie's ghost over <lb/>
again, merely turned around. Theoretically Barrow <lb/>
was his equal, but it was distinctly distasteful to see <lb/>
him exhibit it. He presently said:</p>
<p>"I hope in all sincerity that what you have said is <lb/>
true as regards the Americans, for doubts have crept <lb/>
into my mind several times. It seemed that the equality <lb/>
must be ungenuine where the sign-names of castes were <lb/>
still in vogue; but those sign-names have certainly lost <lb/>
their offense and are wholly neutralized, nullified, and <lb/>
harmless if they are the undisputed property of every <lb/>
individual in the nation. I think I realize that caste does <lb/>
not exist and cannot exist except by common consent <lb/>
of the masses outside of its limits. I thought caste <lb/>
created itself and perpetuated itself; but it seems quite <lb/>
true that it only creates itself, and is perpetuated by <lb/>
the people whom it despises, and who can dissolve it <lb/>
at any time by assuming its mere sign-names them- <lb/>
selves."</p>
<p>"It's what I think. There isn't any power on earth <lb/>
that can prevent England's thirty millions from elect- <lb/>
ing themselves dukes and duchesses to-morrow and <lb/>
calling themselves so. And within six months all the <lb/>
<pb n="94"/>
former dukes and duchesses would have retired from <lb/>
the business. I wish they'd try that. Royalty itself <lb/>
couldn't survive such a process. A handful of frowners <lb/>
against thirty million laughers in a state of irruption: <lb/>
Why, it's Herculaneum against Vesuvius; it would <lb/>
take another eighteen centuries to find that Hercu- <lb/>
laneum after the cataclysm. What's a Colonel in our <lb/>
South? He's a nobody; because they're all colonels <lb/>
down there. No, Tracy" (shudder from Tracy), <lb/>
"nobody in England would call you a gentleman, and <lb/>
you wouldn't call yourself one; and I tell you it's a <lb/>
state of things that makes a man put himself into most <lb/>
unbecoming attitudes sometimes&#x2014;the broad and gen- <lb/>
eral recognition and acceptance of caste <i>as</i> caste does, I <lb/>
mean. Makes him do it unconsciously&#x2014;being bred <lb/>
in him, you see, and never thought over and reasoned <lb/>
out. You couldn't conceive of the Matterhorn being <lb/>
flattered by the notice of one of your comely little <lb/>
English hills, could you?"</p>
<p>"Why, no."</p>
<p>"Well, then, let a man in his right mind try to con- <lb/>
ceive of Darwin feeling flattered by the notice of a <lb/>
princess. It's so grotesque that it&#x2014;well, it paralyzes <lb/>
the imagination. Yet that Memnon <i>was</i> flattered by <lb/>
the notice of that statuette; he <i>says</i> so&#x2014;says so him- <lb/>
self. The system that can make a god disown his <lb/>
godship and profane it&#x2014;oh, well, it's all wrong, it's <lb/>
all wrong and ought to be abolished, I should say."</p>
<p>The mention of Darwin brought on a literary dis- <lb/>
cussion, and this topic roused such enthusiasm in <lb/>
Barrow that he took off his coat and made himself the <lb/>
more free and comfortable for it, and detained him so <lb/>
long that he was still at it when the noisy proprietors <lb/>
of the room came shouting and skylarking in, and <lb/>
began to romp, scuffle, wash, and otherwise entertain <lb/>
themselves. He lingered yet a little longer to offer <lb/>
<pb n="95"/>
the hospitalities of his room and his bookshelf to <lb/>
Tracy, and ask him a personal question or two:</p>
<p>"What is your trade?"</p>
<p>"They&#x2014;well, they call me a cowboy, but that is a <lb/>
fancy; I'm not that. I haven't any trade."</p>
<p>"What do you work at for your living?"</p>
<p>"Oh, anything&#x2014;I mean I <i>would</i> work at anything <lb/>
I could get to do, but thus far I haven't been able to <lb/>
find an occupation."</p>
<p>"Maybe I can help you; I'd like to try."</p>
<p>"I shall be very glad. I've tried, myself, to weari- <lb/>
ness."</p>
<p>"Well, of course, where a man hasn't a regular <lb/>
trade he's pretty bad off in this world. What you <lb/>
needed, I reckon, was less book-learning and more <lb/>
bread-and-butter-learning. I don't know what your <lb/>
father could have been thinking of. You ought to <lb/>
have had a trade, you ought to have had a trade, by <lb/>
<i>all</i> means. But never mind about that; we'll stir up <lb/>
<i>something</i> to do, I guess. And don't you get home- <lb/>
sick; that's a bad business. We'll talk the thing over <lb/>
and look around a little. You'll come out all right. <lb/>
Wait for me&#x2014;I'll go down to supper with you."</p>
<p>By this time Tracy had achieved a very friendly feel- <lb/>
ing for Barrow, and would have <i>called</i> him a friend, <lb/>
maybe, if not taken too suddenly on a straight-out re- <lb/>
quirement to realize on his theories. He was glad of his <lb/>
society, anyway, and was feeling lighter hearted than <lb/>
before. Also he was pretty curious to know what <lb/>
vocation it might be which had furnished Barrow such <lb/>
a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed him <lb/>
so much time to read.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Presently</smcap> the supper-bell began to ring in the <lb/>
depths of the house, and the sound proceeded <lb/>
steadily upward, growing in intensity all the way up <lb/>
toward the upper floors. The higher it came the more <lb/>
maddening was the noise, until at last what it lacked of <lb/>
being absolutely deafening was made up of the sudden <lb/>
crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders down the <lb/>
uncarpeted stairway. The peerage did not go to meals <lb/>
in this fashion; Tracy's training had not fitted him to <lb/>
enjoy this hilarious zo&#x00F6;logical clamor and enthusiasm. <lb/>
He had to confess that there was something about this <lb/>
extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which he <lb/>
would have to get inured to before he could accept it. <lb/>
No doubt in time he would prefer it; but he wished <lb/>
the process might be modified and made just a little <lb/>
more gradual, and not quite so pronounced and violent. <lb/>
Barrow and Tracy followed the avalanche down through <lb/>
an ever increasing and ever more and more aggressive <lb/>
stench of bygone cabbage and kindred smells; smells <lb/>
which are to be found nowhere but in a cheap private <lb/>
boarding house; smells which once encountered can <lb/>
never be forgotten; smells which encountered genera- <lb/>
tions later are instantly recognizable, but never recog- <lb/>
nizable with pleasure. To Tracy these odors were <lb/>
suffocating, horrible, almost unendurable; but he held <lb/>
his peace and said nothing. Arrived in the basement, <lb/>
they entered a large dining-room where thirty-five or <lb/>
<pb n="97"/>
forty people sat at a long table. They took their <lb/>
places. The feast had already begun, and the conver- <lb/>
sation was going on in the liveliest way from one end <lb/>
of the table to the other. The tablecloth was of very <lb/>
coarse material, and was liberally spotted with coffee- <lb/>
stains and grease. The knives and forks were iron, <lb/>
with bone handles. The spoons appeared to be iron <lb/>
or sheet iron, or something of the sort. The tea and <lb/>
coffee cups were of the commonest and heaviest and <lb/>
most durable stoneware. All the furniture of the table <lb/>
was of the commonest and cheapest sort. There was <lb/>
a single large, thick slice of bread by each boarder's <lb/>
plate, and it was observable that he economized it as if <lb/>
he were not expecting it to be duplicated. Dishes of <lb/>
butter were distributed along the table within reach of <lb/>
people's arms, if they had long ones, but there were <lb/>
no private butter-plates. The butter was perhaps good <lb/>
enough, and was quiet and well behaved; but it had <lb/>
more bouquet than was necessary, though nobody <lb/>
commented upon that fact or seemed in any way dis- <lb/>
turbed by it. The main feature of the feast was a <lb/>
piping hot Irish stew made of the potatoes and meat <lb/>
left over from a procession of previous meals. Every- <lb/>
body was liberally supplied with this dish. On the <lb/>
table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham, and <lb/>
there were some other eatables of minor importance&#x2014; <lb/>
preserves and New Orleans molasses and such things. <lb/>
There was also plenty of tea and coffee of an infernal <lb/>
sort, with brown sugar and condensed milk, but the <lb/>
milk and sugar supply was not left at the discretion of <lb/>
the boarders, but was rationed out at headquarters&#x2014; <lb/>
one spoonful of sugar and one of condensed milk to <lb/>
each cup, and no more. The table was waited upon <lb/>
by two stalwart negro women who raced back and <lb/>
forth from the bases of supplies with splendid dash and <lb/>
clatter and energy. Their labors were supplemented <lb/>
<pb n="98"/>
after a fashion by the young girl Puss. She carried <lb/>
coffee and tea back and forth among the boarders, but <lb/>
she made pleasure excursions rather than business ones <lb/>
in this way, to speak strictly. She made jokes with <lb/>
various people. She chaffed the young men pleasantly <lb/>
&#x2014;and wittily, as she supposed, and as the rest also <lb/>
supposed, apparently, judging by the applause and <lb/>
laughter which she got by her efforts. Manifestly she <lb/>
was a favorite with most of the young fellows and <lb/>
sweetheart of the rest of them. Where she conferred <lb/>
notice she conferred happiness, as was seen by the <lb/>
face of the recipient; and at the same time she con- <lb/>
ferred unhappiness&#x2014;one could see it fall and dim the <lb/>
faces of the other young fellows like a shadow. She <lb/>
never "Mistered" these friends of hers, but called <lb/>
them "Billy," "Tom," "John," and they called her <lb/>
"Puss" or "Hattie."</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh sat at the head of the table, his wife sat <lb/>
at the foot. Marsh was a man of sixty, and was an <lb/>
American; but if he had been born a month earlier he <lb/>
would have been a Spaniard. He was plenty good <lb/>
enough Spaniard as it was; his face was very dark, his <lb/>
hair very black, and his eyes were not only exceed- <lb/>
ingly black but were very intense, and there was some- <lb/>
thing about them that indicated that they could burn <lb/>
with passion upon occasion. He was stoop-shouldered <lb/>
and lean-faced, and the general aspect of him was dis- <lb/>
agreeable; he was evidently not a very companionable <lb/>
person. If looks went for anything, he was the very <lb/>
opposite of his wife, who was all motherliness and <lb/>
charity, good-will and good-nature. All the young <lb/>
men and the women called her Aunt Rachel, which <lb/>
was another sign. Tracy's wandering and interested <lb/>
eye presently fell upon one boarder who had been <lb/>
overlooked in the distribution of the stew. He was <lb/>
very pale, and looked as if he had but lately come out <lb/>
<pb n="99"/>
of a sick-bed, and also as if he ought to get back into <lb/>
it again as soon as possible. His face was very melan- <lb/>
choly. The waves of laughter and conversation broke <lb/>
upon it without affecting it any more than if it had <lb/>
been a rock in the sea, and the words and the laughter <lb/>
veritable waters. He held his head down and looked <lb/>
ashamed. Some of the women cast glances of pity <lb/>
toward him from time to time in a furtive and half- <lb/>
afraid way, and some of the youngest of the men <lb/>
plainly had compassion on the young fellow&#x2014;a com- <lb/>
passion exhibited in their faces, but not in any more <lb/>
active or compromising way. But the great majority <lb/>
of the people present showed entire indifference to the <lb/>
youth and his sorrows. Marsh sat with his head down, <lb/>
but one could catch the malicious gleam of his eyes <lb/>
through his shaggy brows. He was watching that <lb/>
young fellow with evident relish. He had not neg- <lb/>
lected him through carelessness, and apparently the <lb/>
table understood that fact. The spectacle was making <lb/>
Mrs. Marsh very uncomfortable. She had the look of <lb/>
one who hopes against hope that the impossible may <lb/>
happen; but as the impossible did not happen, she <lb/>
finally ventured to speak up and remind her husband <lb/>
that Nat Brady hadn't been helped to the Irish stew.</p>
<p>Marsh lifted his head and gasped out, with mock <lb/>
courtliness, "Oh, he hasn't, hasn't he? What a pity <lb/>
that is. I don't know how I came to overlook him. <lb/>
Ah, he must pardon me. You must, indeed, Mr.&#x2014; <lb/>
er&#x2014;Baxter&#x2014;Barker, you must pardon me. I&#x2014;er <lb/>
&#x2014;my attention was directed to some other matter, I <lb/>
don't know what. The thing that grieves me mainly is <lb/>
that it happens every meal now. But you must try to <lb/>
overlook these little things, Mr. Bunker, these little <lb/>
neglects on my part. They're always likely to happen <lb/>
with me in any case, and they are especially likely to <lb/>
happen where a person has&#x2014;er&#x2014;well, where a per- <lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
son is, say, about three weeks in arrears for his board. <lb/>
You get my meaning?&#x2014;you get my idea? Here is <lb/>
your Irish stew, and&#x2014;er&#x2014;it gives me the greatest <lb/>
pleasure to send it to you, and I hope that you will <lb/>
enjoy the charity as much as I enjoy conferring it."</p>
<p>A blush rose in Brady's white cheeks and flowed <lb/>
slowly backward to his ears and upward toward his <lb/>
forehead, but he said nothing and began to eat his food <lb/>
under the embarrassment of a general silence and the <lb/>
sense that all eyes were fastened upon him. Barrow <lb/>
whispered to Tracy:</p>
<p>"The old man's been waiting for that. He wouldn't <lb/>
have missed that chance for anything."</p>
<p>"It's a brutal business," said Tracy. Then he said <lb/>
to himself, purposing to set the thought down in his <lb/>
diary later:</p>
<p>"Well, here in this very house is a republic where <lb/>
all are free and equal, if men are free and equal any- <lb/>
where in the earth; therefore I have arrived at the <lb/>
place I started to find, and I am a man among men, <lb/>
and on the strictest equality possible to men, no doubt. <lb/>
Yet here on the threshold I find an inequality. There <lb/>
are people at this table who are looked up to for some <lb/>
reason or another, and here is a poor devil of a boy <lb/>
who is looked down upon, treated with indifference and <lb/>
shamed by humiliations, when he has committed no <lb/>
crime but that common one of being poor. Equality <lb/>
ought to make men noble-minded. In fact, I had sup- <lb/>
posed it did do that."</p>
<p>After supper Barrow proposed a walk, and they <lb/>
started. Barrow had a purpose. He wanted Tracy to <lb/>
get rid of that cowboy hat. He didn't see his way to <lb/>
finding mechanical or manual employment for a person <lb/>
rigged in that fashion. Barrow presently said:</p>
<p>"As I understand it, you're not a cowboy."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not."</p>
<pb n="101"/>
<p>"Well, now if you will not think me too curious, <lb/>
how did you come to mount that hat? Where'd you <lb/>
get it?"</p>
<p>Tracy didn't know quite how to reply to this, but <lb/>
presently said:</p>
<p>"Well, without going into particulars, I exchanged <lb/>
clothes with a stranger under stress of weather, and I <lb/>
would like to find him and re-exchange."</p>
<p>"Well, why don't you find him? Where is he?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I supposed the best way to find <lb/>
him would be to continue to wear his clothes, which <lb/>
are conspicuous enough to attract his attention if I <lb/>
should meet him on the street."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well," said Barrow; "the rest of the <lb/>
outfit is well enough, and while it's not too conspicu- <lb/>
ous, it isn't quite like the clothes that anybody else <lb/>
wears. Suppress the hat. When you meet your man <lb/>
he'll recognize the rest of his suit. That's a mighty <lb/>
embarrassing hat, you know, in a center of civilization <lb/>
like this. I don't believe an angel could get employ- <lb/>
ment in Washington in a halo like that."</p>
<p>Tracy agreed to replace the hat with something of a <lb/>
modester form, and they stepped aboard a crowded car <lb/>
and stood with others on the rear platform. Presently, <lb/>
as the car moved swiftly along the rails, two men <lb/>
crossing the street caught sight of the backs of Barrow <lb/>
and Tracy, and both exclaimed at once, "There he <lb/>
is!" It was Sellers and Hawkins. Both were so <lb/>
paralyzed with joy that before they could pull them- <lb/>
selves together and make an effort to stop the car it <lb/>
was gone too far, and they decided to wait for the next <lb/>
one. They waited a while; then it occurred to Wash- <lb/>
ington that there could be no use in chasing one horse- <lb/>
car with another, and he wanted to hunt up a hack. <lb/>
But the Colonel said:</p>
<p>"When you come to think of it, there's no occasion <lb/>
<pb n="102"/>
for that at all. Now that I've got him materialized, I <lb/>
can command his motions. I'll have him at the house <lb/>
by the time we get there."</p>
<p>Then they hurried off home in a state of great and <lb/>
joyful excitement.</p>
<p>The hat exchange accomplished, the two new friends <lb/>
started to walk back leisurely to the boarding house. <lb/>
Barrow's mind was full of curiosity about this young <lb/>
fellow. He said:</p>
<p>"You've never been to the Rocky Mountains?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You've never been out on the plains?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"How long have you been in this country?"</p>
<p>"Only a few days."</p>
<p>"You've never been in America before?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Then Barrow communed with himself. "Now what <lb/>
odd shapes the notions of romantic people take. <lb/>
Here's a fellow who's read in England about cowboys <lb/>
and adventures on the plains. He comes here and <lb/>
buys a cowboy's suit. Thinks he can play himself on <lb/>
folks for a cowboy, all inexperienced as he is. Now <lb/>
the minute he's caught in this poor little game, he's <lb/>
ashamed of it and ready to retire from it. It is that <lb/>
exchange that he has put up as an explanation. It's <lb/>
rather thin, too thin altogether. Well, he's young, <lb/>
never been anywhere, knows nothing about the world, <lb/>
sentimental, no doubt. Perhaps it was the natural <lb/>
thing for him to do, but it was a most singular choice, <lb/>
curious freak, altogether."</p>
<p>Both men were busy with their thoughts for a time; <lb/>
then Tracy heaved a sigh and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Barrow, the case of that young fellow troubles <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"You mean Nat Brady?"</p>
<pb n="103"/>
<p>"Yes, Brady, or Baxter, or whatever it was. The <lb/>
old landlord called him by several different names."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, he has been very liberal with names for <lb/>
Brady, since Brady fell into arrears for his board. <lb/>
Well, that's one of his sarcasms&#x2014;the old man thinks <lb/>
he's great on sarcasm."</p>
<p>"Well, what is Brady's difficulty? What is Brady <lb/>
&#x2014;who is he?"</p>
<p>"Brady is a tinner. He's a young journeyman <lb/>
tinner who was getting along all right till he fell sick <lb/>
and lost his job. He was very popular before he lost <lb/>
his job; everybody in the house liked Brady. The old <lb/>
man was rather especially fond of him, but you know <lb/>
that when a man loses his job and loses his ability to <lb/>
support himself and to pay his way as he goes, it <lb/>
makes a great difference in the way people look at him <lb/>
and feel about him."</p>
<p>"Is that so! <i>Is</i> it so?"</p>
<p>Barrow looked at Tracy in a puzzled way. "Why, <lb/>
of course it's so. Wouldn't you know that, naturally? <lb/>
Don't you know that the wounded deer is always <lb/>
attacked and killed by its companions and friends?"</p>
<p>Tracy said to himself, while a chilly and boding dis- <lb/>
comfort spread itself through his system, "In a republic <lb/>
of deer and men, where all are free and equal, mis- <lb/>
fortune is a crime, and the prosperous gore the unfor- <lb/>
tunate to death." Then he said aloud, "Here in the <lb/>
boarding house, if one would have friends and be <lb/>
popular, instead of having the cold shoulder turned <lb/>
upon him, he must be prosperous."</p>
<p>"Yes," Barrow said, "that is so. It's their human <lb/>
nature. They do turn against Brady, now that he's <lb/>
unfortunate, and they don't like him as well as they <lb/>
did before; but it isn't because of any lack in Brady&#x2014; <lb/>
he's just as he was before, has the same nature and the <lb/>
same impulses, but they&#x2014;well, Brady is a thorn in <lb/>
<pb n="104"/>
their conscience, you see. They know they ought to <lb/>
help him and they're too stingy to do it, and they're <lb/>
ashamed of themselves for that, and they ought also to <lb/>
hate themselves on that account, but instead of that <lb/>
they hate Brady because he makes them ashamed of <lb/>
themselves. I say that's human nature; that occurs <lb/>
everywhere; this boarding house is merely the world <lb/>
in little; it's the case all over&#x2014;they're all alike. In <lb/>
prosperity we are popular; popularity comes easy in <lb/>
that case, but when the other thing comes our friends <lb/>
are pretty likely to turn against us."</p>
<p>Tracy's noble theories and high purposes were be- <lb/>
ginning to feel pretty damp and clammy. He won- <lb/>
dered if by any possibility he had made a mistake in <lb/>
throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking <lb/>
up the cross of other people's unprosperity. But he <lb/>
wouldn't listen to that sort of thing; he cast it out of <lb/>
his mind, and resolved to go ahead resolutely along <lb/>
the course he had mapped out for himself.</p>
<p>Extracts from his diary: <lb/>
<q>Have now spent several days in this singular hive. I don't know quite <lb/>
what to make out of these people. They have merits and virtues, but they <lb/>
have some other qualities, and some ways that are hard to get along with. <lb/>
I can't enjoy them. The moment I appeared in a hat of the period I <lb/>
noticed a change. The respect which had been paid me before passed <lb/>
suddenly away, and the people became friendly&#x2014;more than that, they <lb/>
became familiar, and I'm not used to familiarity, and can't take to it right <lb/>
off; I find that out. These people's familiarity amounts to impudence, <lb/>
sometimes. I suppose it's all right; no doubt I can get used to it, but it's <lb/>
not a satisfactory process at all. I have accomplished my dearest wish; I <lb/>
am a man among men, on an equal footing with Tom, Dick, and Harry, <lb/>
and yet it isn't just exactly what I thought it was going to be. I&#x2014;I miss <lb/>
home. Am obliged to say I am homesick. Another thing&#x2014;and this is a <lb/>
confession&#x2014;a reluctant one, but I will make it: The thing I miss most, <lb/>
and most severely, is the respect, the deference, with which I was treated <lb/>
all my life in England, and which seems to be somehow necessary to me. <lb/>
I get along very well without the luxury and the wealth and the sort of <lb/>
<pb n="105"/>
society I've been accustomed to, but I do miss the respect, and can't seem <lb/>
to get reconciled to the absence of it. There is respect, there is deference <lb/>
here, but it doesn't fall to my share. It is lavished on two men. One of <lb/>
them is a portly man of middle age who is a retired plumber. Everybody <lb/>
is pleased to have that man's notice. He's full of pomp and circumstance <lb/>
and self-complacency and bad grammar, and at table he is Sir Oracle, and <lb/>
when he opens his mouth not any dog in the kennel barks. The other <lb/>
person is a policeman at the capitol building. He represents the govern- <lb/>
ment. The deference paid to these two men is not so very far short of that <lb/>
paid to an earl in England, though the method of it differs. Not so much <lb/>
courtliness, but the deference is all there.</q>
<q>Yes, and there is obsequiousness, too.</q>
<q>It does rather look as if in a republic where all are free and equal <lb/>
prosperity and position constitute <i>rank</i>.</q></p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> days drifted by, and they grew ever more <lb/>
dreary. For Barrow's efforts to find work for <lb/>
Tracy were unavailing. Always the first question asked <lb/>
was, "What Union do you belong to?"</p>
<p>Tracy was obliged to reply that he didn't belong to <lb/>
any trade union.</p>
<p>"Very well, then, it's impossible to employ you. <lb/>
My men wouldn't stay with me if I should employ a <lb/>
'scab,' or 'rat,'" or whatever the phrase was.</p>
<p>Finally, Tracy had a happy thought. He said, <lb/>
"Why, the thing for me to do, of course, is to <i>join</i> a <lb/>
trade union."</p>
<p>"Yes," Barrow said; "that is the thing for you to <lb/>
do&#x2014;if you can."</p>
<p>"If I <i>can?</i> Is it difficult?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes," Barrow said, "it's sometimes difficult <lb/>
&#x2014;in fact, very difficult. But you can try, and of <lb/>
course it will be best to try."</p>
<p>Therefore Tracy tried; but he did not succeed. He <lb/>
was refused admission with a good deal of promptness, <lb/>
and was advised to go back home, where he belonged, <lb/>
not come here taking honest men's bread out of their <lb/>
mouths. Tracy began to realize that the situation was <lb/>
desperate, and the thought made him cold to the <lb/>
marrow. He said to himself, "So there is an aris- <lb/>
tocracy of position here, and an aristocracy of pros- <lb/>
perity, and apparently there is also an aristocracy of <lb/>
<pb n="107"/>
the ins as opposed to the outs, and I am with the outs. <lb/>
So the ranks grow daily here. Plainly there are all <lb/>
kinds of castes here, and only one that I belong to&#x2014; <lb/>
the outcasts." But he couldn't even smile at his small <lb/>
joke, although he was obliged to confess that he had a <lb/>
rather good opinion of it. He was feeling so defeated <lb/>
and miserable by this time that he could no longer <lb/>
look with philosophical complacency on the horse-play <lb/>
of the young fellows in the upper rooms at night. At <lb/>
first it had been pleasant to see them unbend and have <lb/>
a good time after having so well earned it by the labors <lb/>
of the day, but now it all rasped upon his feelings <lb/>
and his dignity. He lost patience with the specta- <lb/>
cle. When they were feeling good they shouted, they <lb/>
scuffled, they sang songs, they romped about the place <lb/>
like cattle, and they generally wound up with a pillow- <lb/>
fight, in which they banged each other over the head, <lb/>
and threw the pillows in all directions, and every now <lb/>
and then he got a buffet himself; and they were always <lb/>
inviting him to join in. They called him "Johnny <lb/>
Bull," and invited him with excessive familiarity to <lb/>
take a hand. At first he had endured all this with <lb/>
good nature, but latterly he had shown by his manner <lb/>
that it was distinctly distasteful to him, and very soon <lb/>
he saw a change in the manner of these young people <lb/>
toward him. They were souring on him, as they <lb/>
would have expressed it in their language. He had <lb/>
never been what might be called popular. That was <lb/>
hardly the phrase for it; he had merely been liked, <lb/>
but now dislike for him was growing. His case was <lb/>
not helped by the fact that he was out of luck, couldn't <lb/>
get work, didn't belong to a union, and couldn't gain <lb/>
admission to one. He got a good many slights of that <lb/>
small, ill-defined sort that you can't quite put your <lb/>
finger on, and it was manifest that there was only one <lb/>
thing which protected him from open insult, and that <lb/>
<pb n="108"/>
was his muscle. These young people had seen him <lb/>
exercising mornings, after his cold sponge bath, and <lb/>
they had perceived by his performance and the build <lb/>
of his body that he was athletic, and also versed in <lb/>
boxing. He felt pretty naked now, recognizing that <lb/>
he was shorn of all respect except respect for his fists. <lb/>
One night when he entered his room he found about a <lb/>
dozen of the young fellows there carrying on a very <lb/>
lively conversation punctuated with horse-laughter. <lb/>
The talking ceased instantly, and the frank affront of a <lb/>
dead silence followed. He said:</p>
<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," and sat down.</p>
<p>There was no response. He flushed to the temples, <lb/>
but forced himself to maintain silence. He sat there <lb/>
in this uncomfortable stillness some time, then got <lb/>
up and went out.</p>
<p>The moment he had disappeared he heard a pro- <lb/>
digious shout of laughter break forth. He saw that <lb/>
their plain purpose had been to insult him. He <lb/>
ascended to the flat roof, hoping to be able to cool <lb/>
down his spirit there and get back his tranquility. He <lb/>
found the young tinner up there, alone and brooding, <lb/>
and entered into conversation with him. They were <lb/>
pretty fairly matched now in unpopularity and general <lb/>
ill-luck and misery, and they had no trouble in meeting <lb/>
upon this common ground with advantage and some- <lb/>
thing of comfort to both. But Tracy's movements <lb/>
had been watched, and in a few minutes the tormentors <lb/>
came straggling one after another to the roof, where <lb/>
they began to stroll up and down in an apparently <lb/>
purposeless way. But presently they fell to dropping <lb/>
remarks that were evidently aimed at Tracy, and some <lb/>
of them at the tinner. The ringleader of this little <lb/>
mob was a short-haired bully and amateur prize-fighter <lb/>
named Allen, who was accustomed to lording it over <lb/>
the upper floor, and had more than once shown a dis- <lb/>
<pb n="109"/>
position to make trouble with Tracy. Now there was <lb/>
an occasional cat-call, and hootings, and whistlings, <lb/>
and finally the diversion of an exchange of connected <lb/>
remarks was introduced:</p>
<p>"How many does it take to make a pair?"</p>
<p>"Well, two generally makes a pair, but sometimes <lb/>
there ain't stuff enough in them to make a whole pair." <lb/>
General laugh.</p>
<p>"What were you saying about the English a while <lb/>
ago?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing; the English are all right, only&#x2014; <lb/>
I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What was it you <i>said</i> about them?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I only said they swallow well."</p>
<p>"Swallow better than other people?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; the English swallow a good deal better <lb/>
than other people."</p>
<p>"What is it they swallow best?"</p>
<p>"Oh, insults." Another general laugh.</p>
<p>"Pretty hard to make 'em fight, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"No, 'tain't hard to make 'em fight."</p>
<p>"Ain't it, really?"</p>
<p>"No, 'tain't hard. It's impossible." Another <lb/>
laugh.</p>
<p>"This one's kind of spiritless, that's certain."</p>
<p>"<i>Couldn't</i> be the other way&#x2014;in his case."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know the secret of his birth?"</p>
<p>"No! Has <i>he</i> got a secret of his birth?"</p>
<p>"You bet he has."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"His father was a wax-figger."</p>
<p>Allen came strolling by where the pair was sitting; <lb/>
stopped, and said to the tinner:</p>
<p>"How are you off for friends these days?"</p>
<p>"Well enough off."</p>
<pb n="110"/>
<p>"Got a good many?"</p>
<p>"Well, as many as I need.'</p>
<p>"A friend is valuable, sometimes&#x2014;as a protector, <lb/>
you know. What do you reckon would happen if I <lb/>
was to snatch your cap off and slap you in the face <lb/>
with it?"</p>
<p>"Please don't trouble me, Mr. Allen, I ain't doing <lb/>
anything to you."</p>
<p>"You answer me! What do you reckon would <lb/>
happen?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know."</p>
<p>Tracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation, <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"Don't trouble the young fellow. I can tell you <lb/>
what would happen."</p>
<p>"Oh, you can, can you? Boys, Johnny Bull can <lb/>
tell us what would happen if I was to snatch this <lb/>
chump's cap off and slap him in the face with it. Now <lb/>
you'll see."</p>
<p>He snatched the cap and struck the youth in the <lb/>
face, and before he could inquire what was going to <lb/>
happen it had already happened, and he was warming <lb/>
the tin with the broad of his back. Instantly there <lb/>
was a rush, and shouts of "A ring! a ring! make a <lb/>
ring! Fair play all round! Johnny's grit; give him <lb/>
a chance."</p>
<p>The ring was quickly chalked on the tin, and Tracy <lb/>
found himself as eager to begin as he could have been <lb/>
if his antagonist had been a prince instead of a <lb/>
mechanic. At bottom he was a little surprised at this, <lb/>
because although his theories had been all in that direc- <lb/>
tion for some time, he was not prepared to find himself <lb/>
actually eager to measure strength with quite so com- <lb/>
mon a man as this ruffian. In a moment all the win- <lb/>
dows in the neighborhood were filled with people, and <lb/>
the roofs also. The men squared off, and the fight <lb/>
<pb n="111"/>
began. But Allen stood no chance whatever against <lb/>
the young Englishman. Neither in muscle nor in <lb/>
science was he his equal. He measured his length on <lb/>
the tin time and again; in fact, as fast as he could get <lb/>
up he went down again, and the applause was kept up <lb/>
in liberal fashion from all the neighborhood around. <lb/>
Finally, Allen had to be helped up. Then Tracy de- <lb/>
clined to punish him further and the fight was at an <lb/>
end. Allen was carried off by some of his friends in a <lb/>
very much humbled condition, his face black-and-blue <lb/>
and bleeding, and Tracy was at once surrounded by <lb/>
the young fellows, who congratulated him, and told <lb/>
him that he had done the whole house a service, and <lb/>
that from this out Mr. Allen would be a little more <lb/>
particular about how he handled slights and insults and <lb/>
maltreatment around among the boarders.</p>
<p>Tracy was a hero now, and exceedingly popular. <lb/>
Perhaps nobody had ever been quite so popular on <lb/>
that upper floor before. But if being discountenanced <lb/>
by these young fellows had been hard to bear, their <lb/>
lavish commendations and approval and hero-worship <lb/>
were harder still to endure. He felt degraded, but <lb/>
he did not allow himself to analyze the reasons why <lb/>
too closely. He was content to satisfy himself with <lb/>
the suggestion that he looked upon himself as degraded <lb/>
by the public spectacle which he had made of himself, <lb/>
fighting on a tin roof for the delectation of everybody <lb/>
a block or two around. But he wasn't entirely satis- <lb/>
fied with that explanation of it. Once he went a little <lb/>
too far, and wrote in his diary that his case was worse <lb/>
than that of the prodigal son. He said the prodigal <lb/>
son merely fed swine; he didn't have to chum with <lb/>
them. But he struck that out, and said, "All men <lb/>
are equal. I will not disown my principles. These <lb/>
men are as good as I am."</p>
<p>Tracy was become popular on the lower floors also. <lb/>
<pb n="112"/>
Everybody was grateful for Allen's reduction to the <lb/>
ranks, and for his transformation from a doer of out- <lb/>
rages to a mere threatener of them. The young girls, <lb/>
of whom there were half a dozen, showed many atten- <lb/>
tions to Tracy, particularly that boarding house pet <lb/>
Hattie, the landlady's daughter. She said to him, <lb/>
very sweetly:</p>
<p>"I think you're ever so nice."</p>
<p>And when he said, "I'm glad you think so, Miss <lb/>
Hattie," she said, still more sweetly:</p>
<p>"Don't call me Miss Hattie&#x2014;call me Puss."</p>
<p>Ah, here was promotion! He had struck the sum- <lb/>
mit. There were no higher heights to climb in that <lb/>
boarding house. His popularity was complete.</p>
<p>In the presence of people Tracy showed a tranquil <lb/>
outside, but his heart was being eaten out of him by <lb/>
distress and despair.</p>
<p>In a little while he should be out of money, and then <lb/>
what should he do? He wished now that he had bor- <lb/>
rowed a little more liberally from that stranger's store. <lb/>
He found it impossible to sleep. A single torturing, <lb/>
terrifying thought went racking round and round in <lb/>
his head, wearing a groove in his brain: What should <lb/>
he do&#x2014;what was to become of him? And along with <lb/>
it began to intrude a something presently which was <lb/>
very like a wish that he had not joined the great and <lb/>
noble ranks of martyrdom, but had stayed at home <lb/>
and been content to be merely an earl and nothing <lb/>
better, with nothing more to do in this world of a use- <lb/>
ful sort than an earl finds to do. But he smothered <lb/>
that part of his thought as well as he could; he made <lb/>
every effort to drive it away, and with fair success, but <lb/>
he couldn't keep it from intruding a little now and <lb/>
then, and when it intruded it came suddenly and <lb/>
nipped him like a bite, a sting, a burn. He recognized <lb/>
that thought by the peculiar sharpness of its pang. <lb/>
<pb n="113"/>
The others were painful enough, but that one cut to <lb/>
the quick when it came. Night after night he lay toss- <lb/>
ing to the music of the hideous snoring of the honest <lb/>
bread-winners until two and three o'clock in the morn- <lb/>
ing, then got up and took refuge on the roof, where <lb/>
he sometimes got a nap and sometimes failed entirely. <lb/>
His appetite was leaving him, and the zest of life was <lb/>
going along with it. Finally, one day, being near the <lb/>
imminent verge of total discouragement, he said to <lb/>
himself&#x2014;and took occasion to blush privately when <lb/>
he said it, "If my father knew what my American <lb/>
name is&#x2014;he&#x2014;well, my duty to my father rather <lb/>
<i>requires</i> that I furnish him my name. I have no right <lb/>
to make his days and nights unhappy, I can do enough <lb/>
unhappiness for the family all by myself. Really he <lb/>
ought to know what my American name is." He <lb/>
thought over it a while, and framed a cablegram in his <lb/>
mind to this effect:</p>
<p>"My American name is Howard Tracy."</p>
<p>That wouldn't be suggesting anything. His father <lb/>
could understand that as he chose, and doubtless he <lb/>
would understand it as it was meant, as a dutiful and <lb/>
affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his old <lb/>
father happy for a moment. Continuing his train of <lb/>
thought, Tracy said to himself, "Ah, but if he should <lb/>
cable me to come home! I&#x2014;I&#x2014;couldn't do that&#x2014; <lb/>
I <i>mustn't</i> do that. I've started out on a mission, and <lb/>
I mustn't turn my back on it in cowardice. No, no, I <lb/>
couldn't go home, at&#x2014;at&#x2014;least I shouldn't want to <lb/>
go home." After a reflective pause: "Well, maybe <lb/>
&#x2014;perhaps&#x2014;it would be my <i>duty</i> to go in the circum- <lb/>
stances; he's very old, and he does need me by him <lb/>
to stay his footsteps down the long hill that inclines <lb/>
westward toward the sunset of his life. Well, I'll <lb/>
think about that. Yes, of course it wouldn't be right <lb/>
to stay here. I&#x2014;if I&#x2014;well, perhaps I could just <lb/>
<pb n="114"/>
drop him a line and put it off a little while and satisfy <lb/>
him in that way. It would be&#x2014;well, it would mar <lb/>
everything to have him require me to come instantly." <lb/>
Another reflective pause&#x2014;then: "And yet if he <lb/>
should do that I don't know but&#x2014;oh, dear me&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>home!</i> how good it sounds! and a body is excusable <lb/>
for wanting to see his home again, now and then, <lb/>
anyway."</p>
<p>He went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue <lb/>
and got the first end of what Barrow called the "usual <lb/>
Washington courtesy," where "they treat you as a <lb/>
tramp until they find out you're a Congressman, and <lb/>
then they slobber all over you." There was a boy of <lb/>
seventeen on duty there, tying his shoe. He had his <lb/>
foot on a chair and his back turned towards the wicket. <lb/>
He glanced over his shoulder, took Tracy's measure, <lb/>
turned back, and went on tying his shoe. Tracy <lb/>
finished writing his telegram and waited, still waited, <lb/>
and still waited, for that performance to finish, but <lb/>
there didn't seem to be any finish to it; so finally <lb/>
Tracy said:</p>
<p>"Can't you take my telegram?"</p>
<p>The youth looked over his shoulder and said, by his <lb/>
manner, not his words:</p>
<p>"Don't you think you could wait a minute if you <lb/>
tried?"</p>
<p>However, he got the shoe tied at last, and came and <lb/>
took the telegram, glanced over it, then looked up sur- <lb/>
prised at Tracy. There was something in his look that <lb/>
bordered upon respect, almost reverence, it seemed to <lb/>
Tracy, although he had been so long without anything of <lb/>
this kind he was not sure that he knew the signs of it.</p>
<p>The boy read the address aloud with pleased expres- <lb/>
sion in face and voice.</p>
<p>"The Earl of Rossmore! Cracky! Do you know <lb/>
him?"</p>
<pb n="115"/>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is that so? Does he know you?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;yes."</p>
<p>"Well, I swear! Will he answer you?"</p>
<p>"I think he will."</p>
<p>"Will he, though? Where'll you have it sent?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nowhere. I'll call here and get it. When <lb/>
shall I call?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know&#x2014;I'll send it to you. Where <lb/>
shall I send it? Give me your address; I'll send it to <lb/>
you soon's it comes."</p>
<p>But Tracy didn't propose to do this. He had ac- <lb/>
quired the boy's admiration and deferential respect, <lb/>
and he wasn't willing to throw these precious things <lb/>
away, a result sure to follow if he should give the ad- <lb/>
dress of that boarding house. So he said again that <lb/>
he would call and get the telegram, and went his way.</p>
<p>He idled along, reflecting. He said to himself, <lb/>
"There <i>is</i> something pleasant about being respected. <lb/>
I have acquired the respect of Mr. Allen and some of <lb/>
those others, and almost the deference of some of <lb/>
them on pure merit, for having thrashed Allen. While <lb/>
their respect and their deference&#x2014;if it is deference&#x2014; <lb/>
is pleasant, a deference based upon a sham, a shadow, <lb/>
does really seem pleasanter still. It's no real merit to <lb/>
be in correspondene with an earl, and yet, after all, <lb/>
that boy makes me feel as if there was."</p>
<p>The cablegram was actually gone home! The <lb/>
thought of it gave him an immense uplift. He walked <lb/>
with a lighter tread. His heart was full of happiness. <lb/>
He threw aside all hesitancies, and confessed to himself <lb/>
that he was glad through and through that he was <lb/>
going to give up this experiment and go back to his <lb/>
home again. His eagerness to get his father's answer <lb/>
began to grow now, and it grew with marvelous celerity <lb/>
after it began. He waited an hour, walking about, <lb/>
<pb n="116"/>
putting in his time as well as he could, but interested <lb/>
in nothing that came under his eye, and at last he <lb/>
presented himself at the office again and asked if any <lb/>
answer had come yet. The boy said:</p>
<p>"No, no answer yet;" then glanced at the clock <lb/>
and added, "I don't think it's likely you'll get one <lb/>
to-day."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Well, you see it's getting pretty late. You can't <lb/>
always tell where 'bouts a man is when he's on the <lb/>
other side, and you can't always find him just the <lb/>
minute you want him, and you see it's getting about <lb/>
six o'clock now, and over there it's pretty late at <lb/>
night."</p>
<p>"Why, yes," said Tracy, "I hadn't thought of <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>"Yes, pretty late now&#x2014;half past ten or eleven. <lb/>
Oh, yes, you probably won't get any answer to-night."</p>

<pb n="117"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XIV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>So</smcap> Tracy went home to supper. The odors in that <lb/>
supper-room seemed more strenuous and more <lb/>
horrible that ever before, and he was happy in the <lb/>
thought that he was so soon to be free from them <lb/>
again. When the supper was over he hardly knew <lb/>
whether he had eaten any of it or not, and he certainly <lb/>
hadn't heard any of the conversation. His heart had <lb/>
been dancing all the time, his thoughts had been far <lb/>
away from these things, and in the visions of his mind <lb/>
the sumptuous appointments of his father's castle had <lb/>
risen before him without rebuke. Even the plushed <lb/>
flunky, that walking symbol of a sham inequality, had <lb/>
not been unpleasant to his dreaming view. After the <lb/>
meal Barrow said:</p>
<p>"Come with me. I'll give you a jolly evening."</p>
<p>"Very good. Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"To my club."</p>
<p>"What club is that?"</p>
<p>"Mechanics' Debating Club."</p>
<p>Tracy shuddered slightly. He didn't say anything <lb/>
about having visited that place himself. Somehow he <lb/>
didn't quite relish the memory of that time. The <lb/>
sentiments which had made his former visit there so <lb/>
enjoyable, and filled him with such enthusiasm, had <lb/>
undergone a gradual change, and they had rotted away <lb/>
to such a degree that he couldn't contemplate another <lb/>
visit there with anything strongly resembling delight; <lb/>
<pb n="118"/>
in fact, he was a little ashamed to go. He didn't want <lb/>
to go there and find out by the rude impact of the <lb/>
thought of those people upon his reorganized condition <lb/>
of mind, how sharp the change had been. He would <lb/>
have preferred to stay away. He expected that now <lb/>
he should hear nothing except sentiments which would <lb/>
be a reproach to him in his changed mental attitude, <lb/>
and he rather wished he might be excused. And yet <lb/>
he didn't quite want to say that; he didn't want to <lb/>
show how he did feel, or show any disinclination to <lb/>
go; and so he forced himself to go along with Barrow, <lb/>
privately purposing to take an early opportunity to get <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>After the essayist of the evening had read his paper, <lb/>
the chairman announced that the debate would now be <lb/>
upon the subject of the previous meeting, "The <lb/>
American Press." It saddened the backsliding dis- <lb/>
ciple to hear this anouncement. It brought up too <lb/>
many reminiscences. He wished he had happened <lb/>
upon some other subject. But the debate began, and <lb/>
he sat still and listened.</p>
<p>In the course of the discussion one of the speakers&#x2014; <lb/>
a blacksmith named Tompkins&#x2014;arraigned all monarchs <lb/>
and all lords in the earth for their cold selfishness in <lb/>
retaining their unearned dignities. He said that no <lb/>
monarch and no son of a monarch, no lord and no son <lb/>
of a lord, ought to be able to look his fellow-man in <lb/>
the face without shame. Shame for consenting to <lb/>
keep his unearned titles, property, and privileges at <lb/>
the expense of other people; shame for consenting to <lb/>
remain, on any terms, in dishonorable possession of <lb/>
these things, which represented bygone robberies and <lb/>
wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the nation. <lb/>
He said: "If there were a lord or the son of a lord <lb/>
here I would like to reason with him, and try to show <lb/>
him how unfair and how selfish his position is. I <lb/>
<pb n="119"/>
would try to persuade him to relinquish it, take his <lb/>
place among men on equal terms, earn the bread he <lb/>
eats, and hold of slight value all deference paid him <lb/>
because of artificial position, all reverence not the just <lb/>
due of his own personal merits."</p>
<p>Tracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his <lb/>
own made in talks with his radical friends in England. <lb/>
It was as if some eavesdropping phonograph had <lb/>
treasured up his words and brought them across the <lb/>
Atlantic to accuse him with them in the hour of his <lb/>
defection and retreat. Every word spoken by this <lb/>
stranger seemed to leave a blister on Tracy's con- <lb/>
science, and by the time the speech was finished he <lb/>
felt that he was all conscience and one blister. This <lb/>
man's deep compassion for the enslaved and oppressed <lb/>
millions in Europe who had to bear with contempt of <lb/>
that small class above them, throned upon shining <lb/>
heights whose paths were shut against them, was the <lb/>
very thing he had often uttered himself. The pity in <lb/>
this man's voice and words was the very twin of the <lb/>
pity that used to reside in his own heart and come <lb/>
from his own lips when he thought of these oppressed <lb/>
peoples.</p>
<p>The homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding <lb/>
silence. It was a silence most grateful to Tracy's <lb/>
feelings. He wouldn't have broken it for anything; <lb/>
for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to <lb/>
his spine. He kept saying to himself:</p>
<p>"How unanswerable it all is&#x2014;how absolutely un- <lb/>
answerable! It <i>is</i> basely, degradingly selfish to keep <lb/>
those unearned honors, and&#x2014;and&#x2014;oh, hang it, no- <lb/>
body but a cur&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What an idiotic damned speech that Tompkins <lb/>
made!"</p>
<p>This outburst was from Barrow. It flooded Tracy's <lb/>
demoralized soul with waters of refreshment. These <lb/>
<pb n="120"/>
were the darlingest words the poor vacillating young <lb/>
apostate had ever heard for they whitewashed his <lb/>
shame for him, and that is a good service to have <lb/>
when you can't get the best of all verdicts: self- <lb/>
acquittal.</p>
<p>"Come up to my room and smoke a pipe, Tracy."</p>
<p>Tracy had been expecting this invitation, and had <lb/>
had his declination all ready; but he was glad enough <lb/>
to accept now. Was it possible that a reasonable <lb/>
argument could be made against that man's desolating <lb/>
speech? He was burning to hear Barrow try it. He <lb/>
knew how to start him and keep him going; it was to <lb/>
seem to combat his positions&#x2014;a process effective with <lb/>
most people.</p>
<p>"What is it you object to in Tompkins's speech, <lb/>
Barrow?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the leaving out of the factor of human nature; <lb/>
requiring another man to do what you wouldn't do <lb/>
yourself."</p>
<p>"Do you mean&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, here's what I mean; it's very simple. <lb/>
Tompkins is a blacksmith; has a family; works for <lb/>
wages; and hard, too&#x2014;fooling around won't furnish <lb/>
the bread. Suppose it should turn out that by the <lb/>
death of somebody in England he is suddenly an earl <lb/>
&#x2014;income, half a million dollars a year. What would <lb/>
he do?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&#x2014;I suppose he would have to decline <lb/>
to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Man, he would grab it in a second!"</p>
<p>"Do you really think he would?"</p>
<p>"Think?&#x2014;I don't think anything about it, I know <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Why? Because he's not a fool."</p>
<p>"So you think that if he were a fool, he&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="121"/>
<p>"No, I don't. Fool or <i>no</i> fool, he would grab it. <lb/>
Anybody would. Anybody that's alive. And I've <lb/>
seen dead people that would get up and go for it. I <lb/>
would myself."</p>
<p>This was balm, this was healing, this was rest and <lb/>
peace and comfort.</p>
<p>"But I thought you were opposed to nobilities?"</p>
<p>"Transmissible ones, yes. But that's nothing. I'm <lb/>
opposed to millionaires, but it would be dangerous to <lb/>
offer me the position."</p>
<p>"You'd take it?"</p>
<p>"I would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to <lb/>
go and assume its burdens and responsibilities."</p>
<p>Tracy thought a while, then said:</p>
<p>"I don't know that I quite get the bearings of your <lb/>
position. You say you are opposed to hereditary <lb/>
nobilities, and yet if you had the chance you <lb/>
would&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Take one? In a minute I would. And there <lb/>
isn't a mechanic in that entire club that wouldn't. <lb/>
There isn't a lawyer, doctor, editor, author, tinker, <lb/>
loafer, railroad president, saint&#x2014;land, there isn't a <lb/>
human <i>being</i> in the United States that wouldn't jump <lb/>
at the chance!"</p>
<p>"Except me," said Tracy, softly.</p>
<p>"Except you!" Barrow could hardly get the words <lb/>
out, his scorn so choked him. And he couldn't get <lb/>
any further than that form of words; it seemed to dam <lb/>
his flow utterly. He got up and came and glared <lb/>
upon Tracy in a kind of outraged and unappeasable <lb/>
way, and said again, "Except <i>you!</i>" He walked <lb/>
around him&#x2014;inspecting him from one point of view <lb/>
and then another, and relieving his soul now and then <lb/>
by exploding that formula at him: "Except <i>you!</i>" <lb/>
Finally he slumped down into his chair with the air of <lb/>
one who gives it up, and said:</p>
<pb n="122"/>
<p>"He's straining his viscera and he's breaking his <lb/>
heart trying to get some low-down job that a good dog <lb/>
wouldn't have, and yet wants to let on that if he had a <lb/>
chance to scoop an earldom he wouldn't do it. Tracy, <lb/>
don't put this kind of a strain on me. Lately I'm not <lb/>
as strong as I was."</p>
<p>"Well, I wasn't meaning to put a strain on you, <lb/>
Barrow; I was only meaning to intimate that if an <lb/>
earldom ever does fall in my way&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;I wouldn't give myself any worry about <lb/>
<i>that</i> if I was you. And, besides, I can settle what you <lb/>
would do. Are you any different from me?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;no."</p>
<p>"Are you any better than me?"</p>
<p>"Oh&#x2014;er&#x2014;why, certainly not."</p>
<p>"Are you as <i>good?</i> Come!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I&#x2014;the fact is you take me so sud- <lb/>
denly&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Suddenly? What is there sudden about it? It <lb/>
isn't a difficult question, is it? Or doubtful? Just <lb/>
measure us on the only fair lines&#x2014;the lines of merit <lb/>
&#x2014;and of course you'll admit that a journeyman chair- <lb/>
maker that earns his twenty dollars a week, and has had <lb/>
the good and genuine culture of contact with men, and <lb/>
care, and hardship, and failure, and success, and downs <lb/>
and ups and ups and downs, is just a trifle the superior <lb/>
of a young fellow like you, who doesn't know how to <lb/>
do anything that's valuable, can't earn his living in <lb/>
any secure and steady way, hasn't had any experience <lb/>
of life and its seriousness, hasn't any culture but the <lb/>
artificial culture of books, which adorns but doesn't <lb/>
really educate&#x2014;come! if <i>I</i> wouldn't scorn an earl- <lb/>
dom, what the devil right have <i>you</i> to do it?"</p>
<p>Tracy dissembled his joy, though he wanted to thank <lb/>
the chair-maker for that last remark. Presently a <lb/>
thought struck him, and he spoke up briskly and said:</p>
<pb n="123"/>
<p>"But look here, I really can't quite get the hang of <lb/>
your notions&#x2014;your principles, if they are principles. <lb/>
You are inconsistent. You are opposed to aristocra- <lb/>
cies, yet you'd take an earldom if you could. Am I <lb/>
to understand that you don't blame an earl for being <lb/>
and remaining an earl?"</p>
<p>"I certainly don't."</p>
<p>"And you wouldn't blame Tompkins, or yourself, <lb/>
or me, or anybody, for accepting an earldom if it was <lb/>
offered?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I wouldn't."</p>
<p>"Well, then, whom <i>would</i> you blame?"</p>
<p>"The whole nation&#x2014;any bulk and mass of popu- <lb/>
lation anywhere, in any country, that will put up with <lb/>
the infamy, the outrage, the insult of a hereditary <lb/>
aristocracy which <i>they</i> can't enter&#x2014;and on absolutely <lb/>
free and equal terms."</p>
<p>"Come, aren't you beclouding yourself with distinc- <lb/>
tions that are not differences?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I am not. I am entirely clear-headed <lb/>
about this thing. If I could extirpate an aristocratic <lb/>
system by declining its honors, <i>then</i> I should be a <lb/>
rascal to accept them. And if enough of the mass <lb/>
would join me to make the extirpation possible, <i>then</i> I <lb/>
should be a rascal to do otherwise than help in the <lb/>
attempt."</p>
<p>"I believe I understand&#x2014;yes, I think I get the <lb/>
idea. You have no blame for the lucky few who <lb/>
naturally decline to vacate the pleasant nest they were <lb/>
born into; you only despise the all-powerful and stupid <lb/>
mass of the nation for allowing the nest to exist."</p>
<p>"That's it, that's it! You <i>can</i> get a simple thing <lb/>
through your head if you work at it long enough."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"Don't mention it. And I'll give you some sound <lb/>
advice: when you go back, if you find your nation up <lb/>
<pb n="124"/>
and ready to abolish that hoary affront, lend a hand; <lb/>
but if that isn't the state of things and you get a <lb/>
chance at an earldom, don't you be a fool&#x2014;you take <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>Tracy responded with earnestness and enthusiasm:</p>
<p>"As I live, I'll do it!"</p>
<p>Barrow laughed.</p>
<p>"I never saw such a fellow. I begin to think you've <lb/>
got a good deal of imagination. With you, the idlest <lb/>
fancy freezes into a reality at a breath. Why, you <lb/>
looked, then, as if it wouldn't astonish you if you did <lb/>
tumble into an earldom." Tracy blushed. Barrow <lb/>
added: "Earldom! Oh, yes, take it if it offers; but <lb/>
meantime we'll go on looking around, in a modest <lb/>
way, and if you get a chance to superintend a sausage- <lb/>
stuffer at six or eight dollars a week, you just trade off <lb/>
the earldom for a last year's almanac and stick to the <lb/>
sausage-stuffing."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Tracy</smcap> went to bed happy once more, at rest in his <lb/>
mind once more. He had started out on a high <lb/>
emprise&#x2014;that was to his credit, he argued; he had <lb/>
fought the best fight he could, considering the odds <lb/>
against him&#x2014;that was to his credit; he had been <lb/>
defeated&#x2014;certainly there was nothing discreditable in <lb/>
that. Being defeated, he had a right to retire with <lb/>
the honors of war and go back without prejudice to the <lb/>
position in the world's society to which he had been <lb/>
born. Why not? Even the rabid republican chair- <lb/>
maker would do that. Yes, his conscience was com- <lb/>
fortable once more.</p>
<p>He woke refreshed, happy, and eager for his cable- <lb/>
gram. He had been born an aristocrat, he had been a <lb/>
democrat for a time, he was now an aristocrat again. <lb/>
He marveled to find that this final change was not <lb/>
merely intellectual, it had invaded his feeling; and he <lb/>
also marveled to note that this feeling seemed a good <lb/>
deal less artificial than any he had entertained in his <lb/>
system for a long time. He could also have noted, if <lb/>
he had thought of it, that his bearing had stiffened <lb/>
over night, and that his chin had lifted itself a shade. <lb/>
Arrived in the basement, he was about to enter the <lb/>
breakfast-room when he saw old Marsh in the dim light <lb/>
of a corner of the hall, beckoning him with his finger <lb/>
to approach. The blood welled slowly up in Tracy's <lb/>
cheek, and he said, with a grade of injured dignity <lb/>
almost ducal:</p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p>"Is that for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What is the purpose of it?"</p>
<p>"I want to speak to you&#x2014;in private."</p>
<p>"This spot is private enough for me."</p>
<p>Marsh was surprised; and not particularly pleased. <lb/>
He approached and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, in public, then, if you prefer. Though it <lb/>
hasn't been my way."</p>
<p>The boarders gathered to the spot, interested.</p>
<p>"Speak out," said Tracy. "What is it you want?"</p>
<p>"Well, haven't you&#x2014;er&#x2014;forgot something?"</p>
<p>"I? I'm not aware of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're not? Now you stop and think a <lb/>
minute."</p>
<p>"I refuse to stop and think. It doesn't interest me. <lb/>
If it interests you, speak out."</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Marsh, raising his voice to a <lb/>
slightly angry pitch, "you forgot to pay your board <lb/>
yesterday&#x2014;if you're <i>bound</i> to have it public."</p>
<p>Oh, yes; this heir to an annual million or so had <lb/>
been dreaming and soaring, and had forgotten that <lb/>
pitiful three or four dollars. For penalty he must <lb/>
have it coarsely flung in his face in the presence of <lb/>
these people&#x2014;people in whose countenances was <lb/>
already beginning to dawn an uncharitable enjoyment <lb/>
of the situation.</p>
<p>"Is <i>that</i> all! Take your money and give your <lb/>
terrors a rest."</p>
<p>Tracy's hand went down into his pocket with angry <lb/>
decision. But it didn't come&#x2014;out. The color began <lb/>
to ebb out of his face. The countenances about him <lb/>
showed a growing interest; and some of them a <lb/>
heightened satisfaction. There was an uncomfortable <lb/>
pause; then he forced out, with difficulty, the words:</p>
<p>"I've been robbed!"</p>
<pb n="127"/>
<p>Old Marsh's eyes flamed up with Spanish fire, and <lb/>
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Robbed, is it? <i>That's</i> your tune? It's too old&#x2014; <lb/>
been played in this house too often; everybody plays <lb/>
it that can't get work when he wants it, and won't <lb/>
work when he can get it. Trot out Mr. Allen, some- <lb/>
body, and let <i>him</i> take a toot at it. It's <i>his</i> turn next; <lb/>
<i>he</i> forgot, too, last night. I'm laying for him."</p>
<p>One of the negro women came scrambling down <lb/>
stairs as pale as a sorrel horse with consternation and <lb/>
excitement:</p>
<p>"Misto Marsh, Misto Allen's skipped out!"</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Yes-sah, and cleaned out his room <i>clean;</i> tuck <lb/>
bofe towels en de soap!"</p>
<p>"You lie, you hussy!"</p>
<p>"It's jes' so, jes' as I tells you&#x2014;en Misto Sumner's <lb/>
socks is gone, en Misto Naylor's yuther shirt."</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh was at boiling-point by this time. He <lb/>
turned upon Tracy.</p>
<p>"Answer up now&#x2014;when are you going to settle?"</p>
<p>"To-day&#x2014;since you seem to be in a hurry."</p>
<p>"<i>To-day</i>, is it? Sunday&#x2014;and you out of work? <lb/>
I like that. Come&#x2014;where are you going to get the <lb/>
money?"</p>
<p>"Tracy's spirit was rising again. He proposed to <lb/>
impress these people.</p>
<p>"I am expecting a cablegram from home."</p>
<p>Old Marsh was caught out, with the surprise of it. <lb/>
The idea was so immense, so extravagant, that he <lb/>
couldn't get his breath at first. When he did get it, it <lb/>
came rancid with sarcasm.</p>
<p>"A <i>cablegram</i>&#x2014;think of it, ladies and gents, he's <lb/>
expecting a cablegram! <i>He's</i> expecting a cablegram <lb/>
&#x2014;this duffer, this scrub, this bilk! From his father&#x2014; <lb/>
eh? Yes&#x2014;without a doubt. A dollar or two a word <lb/>
<pb n="128"/>
&#x2014;oh, that's nothing&#x2014;<i>they</i> don't mind a little thing <lb/>
like that&#x2014;<i>this</i> kind's fathers don't. Now his father <lb/>
is&#x2014;er&#x2014;well, I reckon his father&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"My father is an English earl!"</p>
<p>The crowd fell back aghast&#x2014;aghast at the sublimity <lb/>
of the young loafer's "cheek." Then they burst into <lb/>
a laugh that made the windows rattle. Tracy was too <lb/>
angry to realize that he had done a foolish thing. He <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Stand aside, please. I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, your lordship," said Marsh, bow- <lb/>
ing low; "where is your lordship going?"</p>
<p>"For the cablegram. Let me pass."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, your lordship, you'll stay right where <lb/>
you are."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"I mean that I didn't begin to keep boarding house <lb/>
yesterday. It means that I am not the kind that can <lb/>
be taken in by every hack-driver's son that comes <lb/>
loafing over here because he can't bum a living at <lb/>
home. It means that you can't skip out on any <lb/>
such&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Tracy made a step toward the old man, but Mrs. <lb/>
Marsh sprang between, and said:</p>
<p>"Don't, Mr. Tracy, please." She turned to her <lb/>
husband and said, "<i>Do</i> bridle your tongue. What has <lb/>
he done to be treated so? Can't you <i>see</i> he has lost his <lb/>
mind with trouble and distress? He's not responsible."</p>
<p>"Thank your kind heart, madam, but I've not lost <lb/>
my mind; and if I can have the mere privilege of <lb/>
stepping to the telegraph office&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, you can't!" cried Marsh.</p>
<p>"&#x2014;or sending&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Sending! That beats everything. If there's any- <lb/>
body that's fool enough to go on such a chuckle- <lb/>
headed errand&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="129"/>
<p>"Here comes Mr. Barrow&#x2014;he will go for me. <lb/>
Barrow&#x2014;"</p>
<p>A brisk fire of exclamation broke out:</p>
<p>"Say, Barrow, he's expecting a cablegram!"</p>
<p>"Cablegram from his father, you know!"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;cablegram from the wax-figger!"</p>
<p>"And say, Barrow, this fellow's an earl&#x2014;take off <lb/>
your hat, pull down your vest!"</p>
<p>"Yes, he's come off and forgot his crown that he <lb/>
wears Sundays. He's cabled over to his poppy to <lb/>
send it."</p>
<p>"You step out and get that cablegram, Barrow; his <lb/>
majesty's a little lame to-day."</p>
<p>"Oh, stop," cried Barrow; "give the man a <lb/>
chance." He turned, and said with some severity, <lb/>
"Tracy, what's the matter with you? What kind of <lb/>
foolishness is this you've been talking? You ought to <lb/>
have more sense."</p>
<p>"I've not been talking foolishness; and if you'll go <lb/>
to the telegraph office&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't talk so. I'm your friend in trouble and <lb/>
out of it, before your face and behind your back, for <lb/>
anything in <i>reason:</i> but you've lost your head, you <lb/>
see, and this moonshine about a cablegram&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<i>I'll</i> go there and ask for it!"</p>
<p>"Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Brady. <lb/>
Here, I'll give you a written order for it. Fly now <lb/>
and fetch it. We'll soon see!"</p>
<p>Brady flew. Immediately the sort of quiet began to <lb/>
steal over the crowd which means dawning doubt, mis- <lb/>
giving; and might be translated into the words "Maybe <lb/>
he <i>is</i> expecting a cablegram&#x2014;maybe he <i>has</i> got a <lb/>
father somewhere&#x2014;maybe we've been just a little too <lb/>
fresh, just a shade too 'previous!'" Loud talk <lb/>
ceased; then the mutterings and low murmurings and <lb/>
whisperings died out. The crowd began to crumble <lb/>
<pb n="130"/>
apart. By ones and twos the fragments drifted to the <lb/>
breakfast table. Barrow tried to bring Tracy in; but <lb/>
he said:</p>
<p>"Not yet, Barrow&#x2014;presently."</p>
<p>Mrs. Marsh and Hattie tried, offering gentle and <lb/>
kindly persuasions; but he said:</p>
<p>"I would rather wait&#x2014;till he comes."</p>
<p>Even old Marsh began to have suspicions that maybe <lb/>
he had been a trifle too "brash," as he called it in the <lb/>
privacy of his soul, and he pulled himself together and <lb/>
started toward Tracy with invitation in his eyes; but <lb/>
Tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite <lb/>
positive and eloquent. Then followed the stillest <lb/>
quarter of an hour which had ever been known in that <lb/>
house at that time of day. It was so still, and so <lb/>
solemn withal, that when somebody's cup slipped from <lb/>
his fingers and landed in his plate the shock made <lb/>
people start, and the sharp sound seemed as indecorous <lb/>
there and as out of place as if a coffin and mourners <lb/>
were imminent and being waited for. And at last <lb/>
when Brady's feet came clattering down the stairs the <lb/>
sacrilege seemed unbearable. Everybody rose softly <lb/>
and turned toward the door, where stood Tracy; then, <lb/>
with a common impulse, moved a step or two in that <lb/>
direction, and stopped. While they gazed young Brady <lb/>
arrived, panting, and put into Tracy's hand&#x2014;sure <lb/>
enough&#x2014;an envelope. Tracy fastened a bland, vic- <lb/>
torious eye upon the gazers, and kept it there till one <lb/>
by one they dropped their eyes, vanquished and em- <lb/>
barrassed. Then he tore open the telegram and glanced <lb/>
at its message. The yellow paper fell from his finger <lb/>
and fluttered to the floor, and his face turned white. <lb/>
There was nothing there but one word:</p>
<p>"<i>Thanks</i>."</p>
<p>The humorist of the house, the tall, raw-boned Billy <lb/>
Nash, caulker from the navy yard, was standing in the <lb/>
<pb n="131"/>
rear of the crowd. In the midst of the pathetic silence <lb/>
that was now brooding over the place and moving <lb/>
some few hearts there toward compassion, he began to <lb/>
whimper, then he put his handkerchief to his eyes and <lb/>
buried his face in the neck of the bashfulest young <lb/>
fellow in the company, a navy yard blacksmith, <lb/>
shrieked "Oh, pappy, how <i>could</i> you!" and began to <lb/>
bawl like a teething baby, if one may imagine a baby <lb/>
with the energy and the devastating voice of a jackass.</p>
<p>So perfect was the imitation of a child's cry, and so <lb/>
vast the scale of it, and so ridiculous the aspect of the <lb/>
performer, that all gravity was swept from the place as <lb/>
if by a hurricane, and almost everybody there joined <lb/>
in the crash of laughter provoked by the exhibition. <lb/>
Then the small mob began to take its revenge&#x2014;re- <lb/>
venge for the discomfort and apprehension it had <lb/>
brought upon itself by its own too rash freshness of a <lb/>
little while before. It guyed its poor victim, baited <lb/>
him, worried him, as dogs do with a cornered cat. <lb/>
The victim answered back with defiances and challenges <lb/>
which included everybody, and which only gave the <lb/>
sport new spirit and variety; but when he changed his <lb/>
tactics and began to single out individuals and invite <lb/>
them by name, the fun lost its funniness and the <lb/>
interest of the show died out, along with the noise.</p>
<p>Finally Marsh was about to take an innings, but <lb/>
Barrow said:</p>
<p>"Never mind now&#x2014;leave him alone. You've no <lb/>
account with him but a money account. I'll take care <lb/>
of that myself."</p>
<p>The distressed and worried landlady gave Barrow a <lb/>
fervently grateful look for his championship of the <lb/>
abused stranger; and the pet of the house a very <lb/>
prism in her cheap but ravishing Sunday rig blew him <lb/>
a kiss from the tips of her fingers and said, with the <lb/>
darlingest smile and a sweet little toss of her head:</p>
<pb n="132"/>
<p>"You're the only man here, and I'm going to set <lb/>
my cap for you, you dear old thing!"</p>
<p>"For shame, Puss! How you talk! I <i>never</i> saw <lb/>
such a child!"</p>
<p>It took a good deal of argument and persuasion&#x2014; <lb/>
that is to say, petting, under these disguises&#x2014;to get <lb/>
Tracy to entertain the idea of breakfast. He at first <lb/>
said he would never eat again in that house; and added <lb/>
that he had enough firmness of character, he trusted, <lb/>
to enable him to starve like a man when the alternative <lb/>
was to eat insult with his bread.</p>
<p>When he had finished his breakfast, Barrow took <lb/>
him to his room, furnished him a pipe, and said <lb/>
cheerily:</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i>, old fellow, take in your battle-flag out of <lb/>
the wet; you're not in the hostile camp any more. <lb/>
You're a little upset by your troubles, and that's <lb/>
natural enough, but don't let your mind run on them <lb/>
any more than you can help; drag your thoughts away <lb/>
from your troubles&#x2014;by the ears, by the heels, or any <lb/>
other way, so you manage it; it's the healthiest thing <lb/>
a body can do; dwelling on troubles is deadly, just <lb/>
deadly&#x2014;and that's the softest name there is for it. <lb/>
You must keep your mind amused&#x2014;you must, <lb/>
indeed."</p>
<p>"Oh, miserable me!"</p>
<p>"<i>Don't!</i> There's just pure heart-break in that <lb/>
tone. It's just as I say; you've got to get right down <lb/>
to it and amuse your mind, as if it was salvation."</p>
<p>"They're easy words to say, Barrow, but how am I <lb/>
going to amuse, entertain, divert a mind that finds <lb/>
itself suddenly assaulted and overwhelmed by disaster <lb/>
of a sort not dreamed of and not provided for? <lb/>
No-no, the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my <lb/>
feelings. Let us talk of deaths and funerals."</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;not yet. That would be giving up the ship. <lb/>
<pb n="133"/>
We'll not give up the ship yet. I'm going to amuse <lb/>
you; I sent Brady out for the wherewithal before you <lb/>
finished breakfast."</p>
<p>"You did? What is it?"</p>
<p>"Come, this is a good sign&#x2014;curiosity. Oh, there's <lb/>
hope for you yet."</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XVI">
<pb n="134"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XVI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Brady</smcap> arrived with a box, and departed, after <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"They're finishing one up, but they'll be along as <lb/>
soon as it's done."</p>
<p>Barrow took a frameless oil portrait a foot square <lb/>
from the box, set it up in a good light, without com- <lb/>
ment, and reached for another, taking a fugitive glance <lb/>
at Tracy meantime. The stony solemnity in Tracy's <lb/>
face remained as it was, and gave out no sign of <lb/>
interest. Barrow placed the second portrait beside the <lb/>
first, and stole another glance while reaching for a <lb/>
third. The stone image softened a shade. No. 3 <lb/>
forced the ghost of a smile, No. 4 swept indifference <lb/>
wholly away, and No. 5 started a laugh which was still <lb/>
in good and hearty condition when No. 14 took its <lb/>
place in the row.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>you're</i> all right yet," said Barrow. "You <lb/>
see, you're not past amusement."</p>
<p>The pictures were fearful as to color, and atrocious <lb/>
as to drawing and expression; but the feature which <lb/>
squelched animosity and made them funny was a <lb/>
feature which could not achieve its full force in a <lb/>
single picture, but required the wonder-working assist- <lb/>
ance of repetition. One loudly dressed mechanic in <lb/>
stately attitude, with his hand on a cannon, ashore, <lb/>
and a ship riding at anchor in the offing&#x2014;this is <lb/>
merely odd; but when one sees the same cannon and <lb/>
<pb n="135"/>
the same ship in fourteen pictures in a row, and a <lb/>
different mechanic standing watch in each, the thing <lb/>
gets to be funny.</p>
<p>"Explain&#x2014;explain these aberrations," said Tracy.</p>
<p>"Well, they are not the achievement of a single <lb/>
intellect, a single talent&#x2014;it takes two to do these <lb/>
miracles. They are collaborations; the one artist does <lb/>
the figure, the other the accessories. The figure-artist <lb/>
is a German shoemaker with an untaught passion for <lb/>
art, the other is a simple-hearted old Yankee sailor- <lb/>
man whose possibilities are strictly limited to his ship, <lb/>
his cannon, and his patch of petrified sea. They work <lb/>
these things up from twenty-five cent tintypes; they <lb/>
get six dollars apiece for them, and they can grind <lb/>
out a couple a day when they strike what they call a <lb/>
boost&#x2014;that is, an inspiration."</p>
<p>"People actually pay money for these calumnies?"</p>
<p>"They actually do&#x2014;and quite willingly, too. And <lb/>
these abortionists could double their trade and work <lb/>
the women in if Captain Saltmarsh could whirl a horse <lb/>
in, or a piano, or a guitar, in place of his cannon. <lb/>
The fact is, he fatigues the market with that cannon. <lb/>
Even the male market, I mean. These fourteen in <lb/>
the procession are not all satisfied. One is an old <lb/>
"independent" fireman, and he wants an engine in <lb/>
place of the cannon; another is a mate of a tug, and <lb/>
wants a tug in place of the ship&#x2014;and so on, and so <lb/>
on. But the captain can't make a tug that is decep- <lb/>
tive, and a fire engine is many flights beyond his <lb/>
power."</p>
<p>"This <i>is</i> a most extraordinary form of robbery. I <lb/>
never have heard of anything like it. It's interesting."</p>
<p>"Yes, and so are the artists. They are perfectly <lb/>
honest men, and sincere. And the old sailor-man is <lb/>
full of sound religion, and is as devoted a student of <lb/>
the Bible and misquoter of it as you can find anywhere. <lb/>
<pb n="136"/>
I don't know a better man or kinder hearted old soul <lb/>
than Saltmarsh, although he does swear a little some- <lb/>
times."</p>
<p>"He seems to be perfect. I want to know him, <lb/>
Barrow."</p>
<p>"You'll have the chance. I guess I hear them <lb/>
coming now. We'll draw them out on their art, if <lb/>
you like."</p>
<p>The artists arrived and shook hands with great hearti- <lb/>
ness. The German was forty and a little fleshy, with <lb/>
a shiny bald head and a kindly face and deferential <lb/>
manner. Captain Saltmarsh was sixty, tall, erect, <lb/>
powerfully built, with coal-black hair and whiskers, <lb/>
and he had a well-tanned complexion, and a gait and <lb/>
countenance that were full of command, confidence, <lb/>
and decision. His horny hands and wrists were covered <lb/>
with tattoo-marks, and when his lips parted his teeth <lb/>
showed up white and blemishless. His voice was the <lb/>
effortless deep bass of a church organ, and would dis- <lb/>
turb the tranquility of a gas flame fifty yards away.</p>
<p>"They're wonderful pictures," said Barrow. "We've <lb/>
been examining them."</p>
<p>"It is very bleasant dot you like dem," said Handel, <lb/>
the German, greatly pleased. "Und you, Herr Tracy, <lb/>
you haf peen bleased mit dem too, alretty?"</p>
<p>"I can honestly say I have never seen anything just <lb/>
like them before."</p>
<p>"Sch&#x00F6;n!" cried the German, delighted. "You <lb/>
hear, Gaptain? Here is a chentleman, yes, vot abbre- <lb/>
ciate unser aart."</p>
<p>The Captain was charmed, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, sir, we're thankful for a compliment yet, <lb/>
though they're not as scarce now as they used to be <lb/>
before we made a reputation."</p>
<p>"Getting the reputation is the uphill time in most <lb/>
things, Captain."</p>
<pb n="137"/>
<p>"It's so. It ain't enough to know how to reef a <lb/>
gasket, you got to make the mate know you know it. <lb/>
That's reputation. The good word, said at the right <lb/>
time, that's the word that makes us; and evil be to <lb/>
him that evil thinks, as Isaiah says."</p>
<p>"It's very relevant, and hits the point exactly," <lb/>
said Tracy. "Where did you study art, Captain?"</p>
<p>"I haven't studied; it's a natural gift."</p>
<p>"He is born mit dose cannon in him. He tondt <lb/>
haf to do noding, his chenius do all de vork. Of he is <lb/>
asleep, und take a pencil in his hand, out come a <lb/>
cannon. Py crashus, of he could do a clavier, of he <lb/>
could do a guitar, of he could do a vashtub, it is a <lb/>
fortune; heiliger Yohanniss, it is yoost a fortune!"</p>
<p>"Well, it is an immense pity that the business is <lb/>
hindered and limited in this unfortunate way."</p>
<p>The Captain grew a trifle excited himself now.</p>
<p>"You've said it, Mr. Tracy! Hindered? well, I <lb/>
should say so. Why, look here. This fellow here, <lb/>
No. 11, he's a hackman&#x2014;a flourishing hackman, I <lb/>
may say. He wants his hack in this picture. Wants <lb/>
it where the cannon is. I got around that difficulty by <lb/>
telling him the cannon's our trademark, so to speak&#x2014; <lb/>
proves that the picture's our work, and I was afraid if <lb/>
we left it out people wouldn't know for certain if it <lb/>
<i>was</i> a Saltmarsh-Handel&#x2014;now you wouldn't your- <lb/>
self&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What, Captain? You wrong yourself, indeed, you <lb/>
do. Any one who has once seen a genuine Saltmarsh- <lb/>
Handel is safe from imposture forever. Strip it, flay <lb/>
it, skin it out of every detail but the bare color and <lb/>
expression, and that man will still recognize it, still <lb/>
stop to worship&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, how it makes me feel to hear dose oxpres- <lb/>
sions!"</p>
<p>&#x2014;"still say to himself again, as he had said a hun- <lb/>
<pb n="138"/>
dred times before, the art of the Saltmarsh-Handel is <lb/>
an art apart; there is nothing in the heavens above or <lb/>
in the earth beneath that resembles it&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Py chiminy, nur h&#x00F6;ren Sie einmal! In my lifeday <lb/>
haf I never heard so brecious worts."</p>
<p>"So I talked him out of the hack, Mr. Tracy, and <lb/>
he let up on that, and said put in a hearse, then&#x2014; <lb/>
because he's chief mate of a hearse, but don't own <lb/>
it&#x2014;stands a watch for wages, you know. But I can't <lb/>
do a hearse any more than I can a hack; so here we <lb/>
are&#x2014;becalmed, you see. And it's the same with <lb/>
women and such. They come and they want a little <lb/>
johnry picture&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"It's the accessories that make it a <i>genre?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;cannon, or cat, or any little thing like that, <lb/>
that you heave in to whoop up the effect. We could <lb/>
do a prodigious trade with women if we could fore- <lb/>
ground the things they like, but they don't give a <lb/>
damn for artillery. Mine's the lack," continued the <lb/>
Captain, with a sigh. "Andy's end of the business is <lb/>
all right&#x2014;I tell you, <i>he's</i> an artist from wayback!"</p>
<p>"Yoost hear dot old man! He always talk 'poud <lb/>
me like dot," purred the pleased German.</p>
<p>"Look at his work yourself! Fourteen portraits in <lb/>
a row. And no two of them alike."</p>
<p>"Now that you speak of it, it is true; I hadn't <lb/>
noticed it before. It is very remarkable. Unique, I <lb/>
suppose."</p>
<p>"I should say so. That's the very <i>thing</i> about <lb/>
Andy&#x2014;he <i>discriminates</i>. Discrimination's the thief <lb/>
of time&#x2014;forty-ninth Psalm; but that ain't any matter; <lb/>
it's the honest thing, and it pays in the end."</p>
<p>"Yes, he certainly is great in that feature, one is <lb/>
obliged to admit it; but&#x2014;now mind, I'm not really <lb/>
criticising&#x2014;don't you think he is just a trifle over- <lb/>
strong in technique?"</p>
<pb n="139"/>
<p>The Captain's face was knocked expressionless by <lb/>
this remark. It remained quite vacant while he mut- <lb/>
tered to himself: "Technique&#x2014;technique&#x2014;poly- <lb/>
technique&#x2014;pyrotechnique; that's it, likely&#x2014;fire- <lb/>
works&#x2014;too much color." Then he spoke up with <lb/>
serenity and confidence, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, yes, he does pile it on pretty loud; but they <lb/>
all like it, you know&#x2014;fact is, it's the life of the busi- <lb/>
ness. Take that No. 9 there&#x2014;Evans the butcher. <lb/>
He drops into the stoodio as sober-colored as anything <lb/>
you ever see; <i>now</i> look at him. You can't tell him <lb/>
from scarlet-fever. Well, it pleases that butcher to <lb/>
death. I'm making a study of a sausage-wreath to <lb/>
hang on the cannon, and I don't really reckon I can <lb/>
do it right; but if I can, we can break the butcher."</p>
<p>"Unquestionably your confederate&#x2014;I mean your <lb/>
&#x2014;your fellow-craftsman&#x2014;is a great colorist&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, danke sch&#x00F6;n!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>&#x2014;"in fact, a quite extraordinary colorist; a color- <lb/>
ist, I make bold to say, without imitator here or <lb/>
abroad&#x2014;and with a most bold and effective touch, a <lb/>
touch like a battering-ram, and a manner so peculiar <lb/>
and romantic and extraneous and <i>ad libitum</i> and heart- <lb/>
searching that&#x2014;that&#x2014;he&#x2014;he is an impressionist, I <lb/>
presume?"</p>
<p>"No," said the Captain, simply, "he is a Presby- <lb/>
terian."</p>
<p>"It accounts for it all&#x2014;all&#x2014;there's something <lb/>
divine about his art&#x2014;soulful, unsatisfactory, yearning, <lb/>
dim-hearkening on the void horizon, vague-murmuring <lb/>
to the spirit out of ultra-marine distances and far- <lb/>
sounding cataclysms of uncreated space&#x2014;oh, if he&#x2014; <lb/>
if he&#x2014;has he ever tried distemper?"</p>
<p>The Captain answered up, with energy:</p>
<p>"Not if he knows himself! But his dog has, <lb/>
and&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="140"/>
<p>"Oh, no, it vas not <i>my</i> dog."</p>
<p>"Why, you <i>said</i> it was your dog."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Gaptain, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"It was a white dog, wasn't it, with his tail docked, <lb/>
and one ear gone, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Dot's him, dot's him!&#x2014;der fery dog. Wy, py <lb/>
Chorge, dot dog he vould eat baint yoost de same <lb/>
like&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, never mind that now&#x2014;'vast heaving&#x2014;I <lb/>
never saw such a man. You start him on that dog <lb/>
and he'll dispute a year. Blamed if I haven't <i>seen</i> him <lb/>
keep it up a level two hours and a half."</p>
<p>"Why, Captain!" said Barrow. "I guess that <lb/>
must be hearsay."</p>
<p>"No, sir, no hearsay about it&#x2014;he disputed with <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"I don't see how you stood it."</p>
<p>"Oh, you've got to&#x2014;if you run with Andy. But <lb/>
it's the only fault he's got."</p>
<p>"Ain't you afraid of acquiring it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said the Captain, tranquilly; "no danger <lb/>
of that, I reckon."</p>
<p>The artists presently took their leave. Then Barrow <lb/>
put his hands on Tracy's shoulders and said:</p>
<p>"Look me in the eye, my boy. Steady, steady. <lb/>
There&#x2014;it's just as I thought&#x2014;hoped, anyway; <lb/>
<i>you're</i> all right, thank goodness. Nothing the matter <lb/>
with your mind. But don't do that again&#x2014;even for <lb/>
fun. It isn't wise. They wouldn't have believed you <lb/>
if you'd <i>been</i> an earl's son. Why, they <i>couldn't</i>&#x2014; <lb/>
don't you know that? What ever possessed you to <lb/>
take such a freak? But never mind about that; let's <lb/>
not talk of it. It was a mistake; you see that your- <lb/>
self."</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;it <i>was</i> a mistake."</p>
<p>"Well, just drop it out of your mind; it's no harm; <lb/>
<pb n="141"/>
we all make them. Pull your courage together, and <lb/>
don't brood, and don't give up. I'm at your back, <lb/>
and we'll pull through, don't you be afraid." When <lb/>
he was gone, Barrow walked the floor a good while, <lb/>
uneasy in his mind. He said to himself, "I'm troubled <lb/>
about him. He never would have made a break like <lb/>
that if he hadn't been a little off his balance. But I <lb/>
know what being out of work and no prospect ahead <lb/>
can do for a man. First it knocks the pluck out of <lb/>
him and drags his pride in the dirt; worry does the <lb/>
rest, and his mind gets shaky. I must talk to these <lb/>
people. No&#x2014;if there's any humanity in them&#x2014;and <lb/>
there is, at bottom&#x2014;they'll be easier on him if they <lb/>
think his troubles have disturbed his reason. But I've <lb/>
<i>got</i> to find him some work; work's the only medicine <lb/>
for his disease. Poor devil! away off here, and not a <lb/>
friend."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XVII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> moment Tracy was alone his spirits vanished <lb/>
away, and all the misery of his situation was <lb/>
manifest to him. To be moneyless and an object of <lb/>
the chair-maker's charity&#x2014;this was bad enough; but <lb/>
his folly in proclaiming himself an earl's son to that <lb/>
scoffing and unbelieving crew, and, on top of that, the <lb/>
humiliating result&#x2014;the recollection of these things <lb/>
was a sharper torture still. He made up his mind that <lb/>
he would never play earl's son again before a doubtful <lb/>
audience.</p>
<p>His father's answer was a blow he could not under- <lb/>
stand. At times he thought his father imagined he <lb/>
could get work to do in America without any trouble, <lb/>
and was minded to let him try it and cure himself of <lb/>
his radicalism by hard, cold, disenchanting experience. <lb/>
That seemed the most plausible theory, yet he could <lb/>
not content himself with it. A theory that pleased <lb/>
him better was that this cablegram would be followed <lb/>
by another, of a gentler sort, requiring him to come <lb/>
home. Should he write and strike his flag, and ask <lb/>
for a ticket home? Oh, no; that he couldn't <i>ever</i> do <lb/>
&#x2014;at least, not yet. That cablegram would come, it <lb/>
certainly would. So he went from one telegraph <lb/>
office to another every day for nearly a week, and <lb/>
asked if there was a cablegram for Howard Tracy. <lb/>
No, there wasn't any. So they answered him at first. <lb/>
Later, they said it before he had a chance to ask. <lb/>
<pb n="143"/>
Later, still they merely shook their heads impatiently <lb/>
as soon as he came in sight. After that he was <lb/>
ashamed to go any more.</p>
<p>He was down in the lowest depths of despair now, <lb/>
for the harder Barrow tried to find work for him the <lb/>
more hopless the possibilities seemed to grow. At <lb/>
last he said to Barrow:</p>
<p>"Look here. I want to make a confession. I have <lb/>
got down now to where I am not only willing to ac- <lb/>
knowledge to myself that I am a shabby creature and <lb/>
full of false pride, but am willing to acknowledge it to <lb/>
you. Well, I've been allowing you to wear yourself <lb/>
out hunting for work for me when there's been a <lb/>
chance open to me all the time. Forgive my pride&#x2014; <lb/>
what was left of it. It is all gone now, and I've come <lb/>
to confess that if those ghastly artists want another <lb/>
confederate I'm their man&#x2014;for at last I am dead to <lb/>
shame."</p>
<p>"No? Really, can you paint?"</p>
<p>"Not as badly as <i>they</i>. No, I don't claim that, for <lb/>
I am not a genius; in fact; I am a very indifferent <lb/>
amateur, a slouchy dabster, a mere artistic sarcasm; <lb/>
but drunk or asleep I can beat <i>those</i> buccaneers."</p>
<p>"Shake! I want to shout! Oh, I tell you, I am <lb/>
immensely delighted and relieved. Oh, just to work&#x2014; <lb/>
that is life! No matter what the work is&#x2014;that's of <lb/>
no consequence. Just work itself is bliss when a man's <lb/>
been starving for it. I've <i>been</i> there! Come right <lb/>
along, we'll hunt the old boys up. Don't you feel <lb/>
good? I tell you <i>I</i> do."</p>
<p>The freebooters were not at home. But their <lb/>
"works" were&#x2014;displayed in profusion all about the <lb/>
little ratty studio. Cannon to the right of them, <lb/>
cannon to the left of them, cannon in front&#x2014;it was <lb/>
Balaklava come again.</p>
<p>"Here's the uncontented hackman, Tracy. Buckle <lb/>
<pb n="144"/>
to&#x2014;deepen the sea-green to turf, turn the ship into a <lb/>
hearse. Let the boys have a taste of your quality."</p>
<p>The artists arrived just as the last touch was put on. <lb/>
They stood transfixed with admiration.</p>
<p>"My souls but she's a stunner, that hearse! The <lb/>
hackman will just go all to pieces when he sees that&#x2014; <lb/>
won't he, Andy?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is sphlennid, sphlennid! Herr Tracy, why <lb/>
haf you not said you vas a so sublime a artist? Lob' <lb/>
Gott, of you had lif'd in Paris you would be a Pree de <lb/>
Rome, dot's vot's de matter!"</p>
<p>The arrangements were soon made. Tracy was taken <lb/>
into full and equal partnership, and he went straight to <lb/>
work, with dash and energy, to reconstructing gems of <lb/>
art whose accessories had failed to satisfy. Under his <lb/>
hand, on that and succeeding days, artillery disap- <lb/>
peared and the emblems of peace and commerce took <lb/>
its place&#x2014;cats, hacks, sausages, tugs, fire engines, <lb/>
pianos, guitars, rocks, gardens, flower pots, landscapes <lb/>
&#x2014;whatever was wanted, he flung it in; and the more <lb/>
out of place and absurd the required object was, the <lb/>
more joy he got out of fabricating it. The pirates <lb/>
were delighted, the customers applauded, the sex began <lb/>
to flock in, great was the prosperity of the firm. Tracy <lb/>
was obliged to confess to himself that there was some- <lb/>
thing about work&#x2014;even such grotesque and humble <lb/>
work as this&#x2014;which most pleasantly satisfied a <lb/>
something in his nature which had never been satisfied <lb/>
before, and also gave him a strange new dignity in his <lb/>
own private view of himself.</p>
<p>The Unqualified Member from Cherokee Strip was <lb/>
in a state of deep dejection. For a good while now he <lb/>
had been leading a sort of life which was calculated to <lb/>
kill; for it had consisted in regularly alternating days <lb/>
of brilliant hope and black disappointment. The <lb/>
<pb n="145"/>
brilliant hopes were created by the magician Sellers, <lb/>
and they always promised that <i>now</i> he had got the <lb/>
trick sure, and would effectively influence that material- <lb/>
ized cowboy to call at the Towers before night. The <lb/>
black disappointments consisted in the persistent and <lb/>
monotonous failure of these prophecies.</p>
<p>At the date which this history has now reached, <lb/>
Sellers was appalled to find that the usual remedy was <lb/>
inoperative, and that Hawkins's low spirits refused <lb/>
absolutely to lift. Something must be done, he re- <lb/>
flected; it was heart-breaking, this woe, this smileless <lb/>
misery, this dull despair that looked out from his poor <lb/>
friend's face. Yes, he must be cheered up. He <lb/>
mused a while, then he saw his way. He said, in his <lb/>
most conspicuously casual vein:</p>
<p>"Er-uh&#x2014;by the way, Hawkins, we are feeling dis- <lb/>
appointed about this thing&#x2014;the way the materializee <lb/>
is acting, I mean&#x2014;we are disappointed; you concede <lb/>
that?"</p>
<p>"Concede it? Why, yes, if you like the term."</p>
<p>"Very well; so far, so good. Now for the <i>basis</i> of <lb/>
the feeling. It is not that your heart, your affections <lb/>
are concerned; that is to say, it is not that you <i>want</i> <lb/>
the materializee <i>Itself</i>. You concede that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I concede that, too&#x2014;cordially."</p>
<p>"Very well, again; we are making progress. To <lb/>
sum up: The feeling, it is conceded, is not engendered <lb/>
by the mere conduct of the materializee; it is conceded <lb/>
that it does not arise from any pang which the <i>per- <lb/>
sonality</i> of the materializee could assuage. Now, then," <lb/>
said the earl, with the light of triumph in his eye, "the <lb/>
inexorable logic of the situation narrows us down to <lb/>
this: our feeling has its source in the <i>money</i>-loss in- <lb/>
volved. Come&#x2014;isn't that so?"</p>
<p>"Goodness knows I concede that, with all my <lb/>
heart."</p>
<pb n="146"/>
<p>"Very well. When you've found out the source of <lb/>
a disease, you've also found out what remedy is re- <lb/>
quired&#x2014;just as in this case. In this case money is <lb/>
required. And <i>only</i> money."</p>
<p>The old, old seduction was in that airy, confident <lb/>
tone and those significant words&#x2014;usually called preg- <lb/>
nant words in books. The old answering signs of faith <lb/>
and hope showed up in Hawkins's countenance, and <lb/>
he said:</p>
<p>"<i>Only</i> money? Do you mean that you know a way <lb/>
to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Washington, have you the impression that I have <lb/>
no resources but those I allow the public and my inti- <lb/>
mate friends to know about?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&#x2014;er&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Is it <i>likely</i>, do you think, that a man moved by <lb/>
nature and taught by experience to keep his affairs to <lb/>
himself, and a cautious and reluctant tongue in his <lb/>
head, wouldn't be thoughtful enough to keep a few <lb/>
resources in reserve for a rainy day, when he's got as <lb/>
many as I have to select from?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you make me feel so much better already, <lb/>
Colonel!"</p>
<p>"Have you ever been in my laboratory?"</p>
<p>"Why no."</p>
<p>"That's it. You see, you didn't even know that I <lb/>
had one. Come along. I've got a little trick there <lb/>
that I want to show you. I've kept it perfectly quiet, <lb/>
not fifty people know anything about it. But that's <lb/>
my way, always been my way. Wait till you're <i>ready</i>, <lb/>
that's the idea; and <i>when</i> you're ready, <i>zzip!</i>&#x2014;let <lb/>
her go!"</p>
<p>"Well, Colonel, I've never seen a man that I've had <lb/>
such unbounded confidence in as you. When you say <lb/>
a thing right out, I always feel as if that ends it; as if <lb/>
that is evidence, and proof, and everything else."</p>
<pb n="147"/>
<p>The old earl was profoundly pleased and touched.</p>
<p>"I'm glad <i>you</i> believe in me, Washington; not <lb/>
everybody is so just."</p>
<p>"I always have believed in you; and I always shall <lb/>
as long as I live."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my boy. You sha'n't repent it. And <lb/>
you <i>can't</i>." Arrived in the "laboratory," the earl <lb/>
continued, "Now, cast your eye around this room&#x2014; <lb/>
what do you see? <i>Apparently</i> a junk-shop; <i>apparently</i> <lb/>
a hospital connected with a patent office&#x2014;in <i>reality</i>, <lb/>
the mines of Golconda in disguise! Look at that thing <lb/>
there. Now what would you take that thing to be?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe I could ever imagine."</p>
<p>"Of course you couldn't. It's my grand adapta- <lb/>
tion of the phonograph to the marine service. You <lb/>
store up profanity in it for use at sea. You know that <lb/>
sailors don't fly around worth a cent unless you swear <lb/>
at them&#x2014;so the mate that can do the best job of <lb/>
swearing is the most valuable man. In great emer- <lb/>
gencies his talent saves the ship. But a ship is a large <lb/>
thing, and he can't be everywhere at once; so there <lb/>
have been times when one mate has lost a ship which <lb/>
could have been saved if they had had a hundred. <lb/>
Prodigious storms, you know. Well, a ship can't <lb/>
afford a hundred mates; but she can afford a hundred <lb/>
Cursing Phonographs, and distribute them all over the <lb/>
vessel&#x2014;and there, you see, she's armed at every <lb/>
point. Imagine a big storm, and a hundred of my <lb/>
machines all cursing away at once&#x2014;splendid spec- <lb/>
tacle, splendid!&#x2014;you couldn't hear yourself think. <lb/>
Ship goes through that storm perfectly serene&#x2014;she's <lb/>
just as safe as she'd be on shore."</p>
<p>"It's a wonderful idea. How do you prepare the <lb/>
thing?"</p>
<p>"Load it&#x2014;simply load it."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<pb n="148"/>
<p>"Why, you just stand over it and swear into it."</p>
<p>"That loads it, does it?"</p>
<p>"Yes; because every word it collars it <i>keeps</i>&#x2014;keeps <lb/>
it forever. Never wears out. Any time you turn the <lb/>
crank, out it'll come. In times of great peril you can <lb/>
reverse it, and it'll swear backwards. <i>That</i> makes a <lb/>
sailor hump himself!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. Who loads them?&#x2014;the mate?"</p>
<p>"Yes, if he chooses. Or I'll furnish them already <lb/>
loaded. I can hire an expert for &#x0024;75 a month who <lb/>
will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in one hun- <lb/>
dred and fifty hours, and do it <i>easy</i>. And an expert <lb/>
can furnish a stronger article, of course, than the mere <lb/>
average uncultivated mate could. Then, you see, all <lb/>
the ships of the world will buy them ready loaded&#x2014; <lb/>
for I shall have them loaded in any language a customer <lb/>
wants. Hawkins, it will work the grandest moral re- <lb/>
form of the nineteenth century. Five years from now <lb/>
<i>all</i> the swearing will be done by machinery&#x2014;you <lb/>
won't ever hear a profane word come from human lips <lb/>
on a ship. Millions of dollars have been spent by the <lb/>
churches in the effort to abolish profanity in the com- <lb/>
mercial marine. Think of it&#x2014;my name will live for- <lb/>
ever in the affections of good men as the man who, <lb/>
solitary and alone, accomplished this noble and ele- <lb/>
vating reform."</p>
<p>"Oh, it <i>is</i> grand and beneficent and beautiful. <lb/>
How <i>did</i> you ever come to think of it? You have a <lb/>
wonderful mind. How did you say you loaded the <lb/>
machine?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's no trouble&#x2014;perfectly simple. If you <lb/>
want to load it up loud and strong, you stand right <lb/>
over it and shout. But if you leave it open and all <lb/>
set, it'll <i>eavesdrop</i>, so to speak&#x2014;that is to say, it will <lb/>
load itself up with any sounds that are made within six <lb/>
feet of it. Now I'll show you how it works. I had <lb/>
<pb n="149"/>
an expert come and load this one up yesterday. <lb/>
Hello, it's been left open&#x2014;it's too bad&#x2014;still I <lb/>
reckon it hasn't had much chance to collect irrelevant <lb/>
stuff. All you do is to press this button in the floor&#x2014; <lb/>
so."</p>
<p>The phonograph began to sing in a plaintive voice: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>There is a boarding-house, far far away,</l>
<l>Where they have ham and eggs, three times a day.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"Hang it, <i>that</i> ain't it. Somebody's been singing <lb/>
around here."</p>
<p>The plaintive song began again, mingled with a low, <lb/>
gradually rising wail of cats slowly warming up towards <lb/>
a fight: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>O, <i>how</i> the boarders yell,</l>
<l>When they hear that dinner-bell&#x2014;</l>
<l>They give that landlord&#x2014;</l>
</lg></q>
(momentary outburst of terrific cat-fight which drowns <lb/>
out one word). <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Three times a day.</l>
</lg></q>
(Renewal of furious cat-fight for a moment. The <lb/>
plaintive voice on a high fierce key, "<i>Scat</i>, you <lb/>
devils!" and a racket as of flying missiles.)</p>
<p>"Well, never mind&#x2014;let it go. I've got some sailor <lb/>
profanity down in there somewhere, if I could get to <lb/>
it. But it isn't any matter; you see how the machine <lb/>
works."</p>
<p>Hawkins responded, with enthusiasm:</p>
<p>"Oh, it works admirably! I know there's a hun- <lb/>
dred fortunes in it."</p>
<p>"And mind, the Hawkins family get their share, <lb/>
Washington."</p>
<p>"Oh, thanks, thanks; you are just as generous as <lb/>
ever. Ah, it's the grandest invention of the age!"</p>
<p>"Ah, well, we live in wonderful times. The ele- <lb/>
<pb n="150"/>
ments are crowded <i>full</i> of beneficent forces&#x2014;always <lb/>
<i>have</i> been&#x2014;and ours is the first generation to turn <lb/>
them to account and make them work for us. Why, <lb/>
Hawkins, <i>everything</i> is useful&#x2014;<i>nothing</i> ought ever to <lb/>
be wasted. Now look at sewer-gas, for instance. <lb/>
Sewer-gas has always been wasted heretofore; nobody <lb/>
tried to save up sewer-gas&#x2014;you can't name me a <lb/>
man. Ain't that so? <i>You</i> know perfectly well it's so."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is so&#x2014;but I never&#x2014;er&#x2014;I don't quite <lb/>
see why a body&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Should <i>want</i> to save it up? Well, I'll tell you. <lb/>
Do you see this little invention here?&#x2014;it's a decom- <lb/>
poser&#x2014;I call it a decomposer. I give you my word <lb/>
of honor that if you show me a house that produces a <lb/>
given quantity of sewer-gas in a day, I'll engage to set <lb/>
up my decomposer there and make that house produce <lb/>
a hundred times that quantity of sewer-gas in less than <lb/>
half an hour."</p>
<p>"Dear me, but why should you want to?"</p>
<p>"<i>Want</i> to? Listen, and you'll see. My boy, for <lb/>
illuminating purposes and economy combined, there's <lb/>
nothing in the world that begins with sewer-gas. And <lb/>
really it don't cost a cent. You put in a good inferior <lb/>
article of plumbing&#x2014;such as you find everywhere&#x2014; <lb/>
and add my decomposer, and there you are. Just use <lb/>
the ordinary gas-pipes&#x2014;and there your expense ends. <lb/>
Think of it. Why, Major, in five years from now you <lb/>
won't see a house lighted with anything but sewer-gas. <lb/>
Every physician I talk to recommends it, and every <lb/>
plumber."</p>
<p>"But isn't it dangerous?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, more or less, but everything is&#x2014;coal- <lb/>
gas, candles, electricity&#x2014;there isn't anything that <lb/>
ain't."</p>
<p>"It lights up well, does it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, magnificently."</p>
<pb n="151"/>
<p>"Have you given it a good trial?"</p>
<p>"Well, no, not a first-rate one. Polly's prejudiced, <lb/>
and she won't let me put it in here; but I'm playing <lb/>
my cards to get it adopted in the President's house, <lb/>
and <i>then</i> it'll go&#x2014;don't you doubt it. I shall not <lb/>
need this one for the present, Washington; you may <lb/>
take it down to some boarding house and give it a trial <lb/>
if you like."</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XVIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Washington</smcap> shuddered slightly at the sugges- <lb/>
tion; then his face took on a dreamy look and <lb/>
he dropped into a trance of thought. After a little <lb/>
Sellers asked him what he was grinding in his mental <lb/>
mill.</p>
<p>"Well, this. Have you got some secret project in <lb/>
your head which requires a Bank of England back of <lb/>
it to make it succeed?"</p>
<p>The Colonel showed lively astonishment, and said:</p>
<p>"Why, Hawkins, are you a mind-reader?"</p>
<p>"I? I never thought of such a thing."</p>
<p>"Well, then, how did you happen to drop on to <lb/>
that idea in this curious fashion? It's just mind- <lb/>
reading&#x2014;that's what it is, though you may not know <lb/>
it. Because I <i>have</i> got a private project that requires <lb/>
a Bank of England at its back. How could you divine <lb/>
that? What was the process? This is interesting."</p>
<p>"There wasn't any process. A thought like this <lb/>
happened to slip through my head by accident: How <lb/>
much would make you or me comfortable? A hun- <lb/>
dred thousand. Yet you are expecting two or three <lb/>
of these inventions of yours to turn out some billions of <lb/>
money&#x2014;and you are <i>wanting</i> them to do that. If <lb/>
you wanted ten millions, I could understand that&#x2014;it's <lb/>
inside the human limits. But billions! That's clear <lb/>
outside the limits. There must be a definite project <lb/>
back of that somewhere."</p>
<pb n="153"/>
<p>The earl's interest and surprise augmented with <lb/>
every word, and when Hawkins finished he said, with <lb/>
strong admiration:</p>
<p>"It's wonderfully reasoned out, Washington, it cer- <lb/>
tainly is. It shows what I think is quite extraordinary <lb/>
penetration. For you've hit it; you've driven the <lb/>
center, you've plugged the bull's-eye of my dream. <lb/>
Now I'll tell you the whole thing, and you'll under- <lb/>
stand it. I don't need to ask you to keep it to your- <lb/>
self, because you'll see that the project will prosper all <lb/>
the better for being kept in the background till the <lb/>
right time. Have you noticed how many pamphlets <lb/>
and books I've got lying around relating to Russia?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I think most anybody would notice that&#x2014; <lb/>
anybody who wasn't dead."</p>
<p>"Well, I've been posting myself a good while. <lb/>
That's a great and splendid nation, and deserves to be <lb/>
set free." He paused; then added, in a quite matter- <lb/>
of-fact way, "When I get this money I'm going to set <lb/>
it free."</p>
<p>"Great guns!"</p>
<p>"Why, what makes you jump like that?"</p>
<p>"Dear me, when you are going to drop a remark <lb/>
under a man's chair that is likely to blow him out <lb/>
through the roof, why don't you put some expression, <lb/>
some force, some noise into it that will prepare him? <lb/>
You shouldn't flip out such a gigantic thing as this in <lb/>
that colorless kind of a way. You do jolt a person up <lb/>
so. Go on now, I'm all right again. Tell me all about <lb/>
it. I'm all interest&#x2014;yes, and sympathy, too."</p>
<p>"Well, I've looked the ground over, and concluded <lb/>
that the methods of the Russian patriots, while good <lb/>
enough considering the way the boys are hampered, <lb/>
are not the best&#x2014;at least, not the quickest. They <lb/>
are trying to revolutionize Russia from <i>within;</i> that's <lb/>
pretty slow, you know, and liable to interruption all <lb/>
<pb n="154"/>
the time, and is full of perils for the workers. Do you <lb/>
know how Peter the Great started his army? He didn't <lb/>
start it on the family premises under the noses of the <lb/>
Strelitzes; no, he started it away off yonder, privately <lb/>
&#x2014;only just one regiment, you know, and he built to <lb/>
<i>that</i>. The first thing the Strelitzes knew, the regiment <lb/>
was an <i>army</i>, their position was turned, and they had <lb/>
to take a walk. Just that little idea <i>made</i> the biggest <lb/>
and worst of all the despotisms the world has seen. <lb/>
The same idea can <i>un</i>make it. I'm going to prove it. <lb/>
I'm going to get out to one side and work my scheme <lb/>
the way Peter did."</p>
<p>"This is mighty interesting, Rossmore. What is it <lb/>
you are going to do?"</p>
<p>"I am going to buy Siberia and start a republic."</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;bang you go again without giving any <lb/>
notice! Going to <i>buy</i> it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, as soon as I get the money. I don't care <lb/>
what the price is, I shall take it. I can afford it, and I <lb/>
will. Now, then, consider this&#x2014;and you've never <lb/>
thought of it, I'll warrant. Where is the place where <lb/>
there is twenty-five times more manhood, pluck, true <lb/>
heroism, unselfishness, devotion to high and noble <lb/>
ideals, adoration of liberty, wide education, and <i>brains</i>, <lb/>
per thousand of population, than any other domain in <lb/>
the whole world can show?"</p>
<p>"Siberia!"</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"It is true; it certainly is true, but I never thought <lb/>
of it before."</p>
<p>"Nobody ever thinks of it. But it's so, just the <lb/>
same. In those mines and prisons are gathered to- <lb/>
gether the very finest and noblest and capablest multi- <lb/>
tude of human beings that God is able to create. Now <lb/>
if you had that kind of a population to sell, would you <lb/>
offer it to a despotism? No, the despotism has no use <lb/>
<pb n="155"/>
for it; you would lose money. A despotism has no <lb/>
use for anything but human cattle. But suppose you <lb/>
want to start a republic?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I see. It's just the material for it."</p>
<p>"Well, I should say so! There's Siberia, with just <lb/>
the very finest and choicest material on the globe for a <lb/>
republic, and more coming&#x2014;more coming all the <lb/>
time, don't you see! It is being daily, weekly, <lb/>
monthly recruited by the most perfectly devised sys- <lb/>
tem that has ever been invented perhaps. By this <lb/>
system the whole of the hundred millions of Russia <lb/>
are being constantly and patiently sifted, sifted, sifted <lb/>
by myriads of trained experts, spies appointed by the <lb/>
emperor personally; and whenever they catch a man, <lb/>
woman, or child that has got any brains or education or <lb/>
character they ship that person straight to Siberia. It <lb/>
is admirable, it is wonderful. It is so searching and <lb/>
so effective that it keeps the general level of Russian <lb/>
intellect and education down to that of the Czar."</p>
<p>"Come, that sounds like exaggeration."</p>
<p>"Well, it's what they say anyway. But I think, <lb/>
myself, it's a lie. And it doesn't seem right to slander <lb/>
a whole nation that way, anyhow. Now, then, you <lb/>
see what the material is, there in Siberia, for a repub- <lb/>
lic." He paused, and his breast began to heave and <lb/>
his eye to burn under the impulse of strong emotion. <lb/>
Then his words began to stream forth with constantly <lb/>
increasing energy and fire, and he rose to his feet as <lb/>
if to give himself larger freedom. "The minute I <lb/>
organize that republic, the light of liberty, intelligence, <lb/>
justice, humanity, bursting from it, flooding from it, <lb/>
flaming from it, will concentrate the gaze of the whole <lb/>
astonished world as upon the miracle of a new sun; <lb/>
Russia's countless multitudes of slaves will rise up and <lb/>
march, march!&#x2014;eastward, with that great light trans- <lb/>
figuring their faces as they come, and far back of them <lb/>
<pb n="156"/>
you will see&#x2014;what will you see?&#x2014;a vacant throne in <lb/>
an empty land! It can be done, and by God I will do <lb/>
it!"</p>
<p>He stood a moment bereft of earthly consciousness <lb/>
by his exaltation; then consciousness returned, bring- <lb/>
ing him a slight shock, and he said, with grave earnest- <lb/>
ness:</p>
<p>"I must ask you to pardon me, Major Hawkins. I <lb/>
have never used that expression before, and I beg you <lb/>
will forgive it this time."</p>
<p>Hawkins was quite willing.</p>
<p>"You see, Washington, it is an error which I am <lb/>
by nature not liable to. Only excitable people, im- <lb/>
pulsive people, are exposed to it. But the circum- <lb/>
stances of the present case&#x2014;I being a democrat by <lb/>
birth and preference, and an aristocrat by inheritance <lb/>
and relish&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The earl stopped suddenly, his frame stiffened, and <lb/>
he began to stare speechless through the curtainless <lb/>
window. Then he pointed, and gasped out a single <lb/>
rapturous word:</p>
<p>"Look!"</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> it, Colonel?"</p>
<p>"<i>It!</i>"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Sure as you're born. Keep perfectly still. I'll <lb/>
apply the influence&#x2014;I'll turn on all my force. I've <lb/>
brought It thus far&#x2014;I'll fetch It right into the house. <lb/>
You'll see."</p>
<p>He was making all sorts of passes in the air with his <lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>"There! Look at that. I've made It smile! <lb/>
See?"</p>
<p>Quite true. Tracy, out for an afternoon stroll, had <lb/>
come unexpectantly upon his family arms displayed <lb/>
upon this shabby house-front. The hatchments made <lb/>
<pb n="157"/>
him smile; which was nothing, they had made the <lb/>
neighborhood cats do that.</p>
<p>"Look, Hawkins, look! I'm drawing It over!"</p>
<p>"You're drawing It sure, Rossmore. If I ever had <lb/>
any doubts about materialization, they're gone now, <lb/>
and gone for good. Oh, this is a joyful day!"</p>
<p>Tracy was sauntering over to read the doorplate. <lb/>
Before he was half-way over he was saying to himself, <lb/>
"Why, manifestly these are the American Claimant's <lb/>
quarters."</p>
<p>"It's coming&#x2014;coming right along. I'll slide down <lb/>
and pull It in. You follow after me."</p>
<p>Sellers, pale and a good deal agitated, opened the <lb/>
door and confronted Tracy. The old man could not <lb/>
at once get his voice; then he pumped out a scattering <lb/>
and hardly coherent salutation, and followed it with:</p>
<p>"Walk in, walk right in, Mr.&#x2014;er&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Tracy&#x2014;Howard Tracy."</p>
<p>&#x2014;"Tracy&#x2014;thanks&#x2014;walk right in, you're ex- <lb/>
pected."</p>
<p>Tracy entered, considerably puzzled, and said:</p>
<p>"Expected? I think there must be some mistake."</p>
<p>"Oh, I judge not," said Sellers, who noticing that <lb/>
Hawkins had arrived, gave him a sidewise glance in- <lb/>
tended to call his close attention to a dramatic effect <lb/>
which he was proposing to produce by his next remark. <lb/>
Then he said, slowly and impressively: "I am&#x2014;<i>You <lb/>
Know Who</i>."</p>
<p>To the astonishment of both conspirators the remark <lb/>
produced no dramatic effect at all; for the new-comer <lb/>
responded, with a quite innocent and unembarrassed <lb/>
air:</p>
<p>"No, pardon me. I don't <i>know</i> who you are. I <lb/>
only suppose&#x2014;but no doubt correctly&#x2014;that you are <lb/>
the gentleman whose title is on the doorplate."</p>
<p>"Right, quite right&#x2014;sit down, pray sit down." <lb/>
<pb n="158"/>
The earl was rattled, thrown off his bearings, his head <lb/>
was in a whirl. Then he noticed Hawkins standing <lb/>
apart and staring idiotically at what to him was the <lb/>
apparition of a defunct man, and a new idea was born <lb/>
to him. He said to Tracy, briskly:</p>
<p>"But a thousand pardons, dear sir, I am forgetting <lb/>
courtesies due to a guest and stranger. Let me in- <lb/>
troduce my friend General Hawkins&#x2014;General Hawk- <lb/>
ins, our new Senator&#x2014;Senator from the latest and <lb/>
grandest addition to the radiant galaxy of sovereign <lb/>
States, Cherokee Strip"&#x2014;(to himself, "that name <lb/>
will shrivel him up!"&#x2014;but it didn't in the least, <lb/>
and the Colonel resumed the introduction piteously <lb/>
disheartened and amazed)&#x2014;"Senator Hawkins, Mr. <lb/>
Howard Tracy, of&#x2014;er&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"England."</p>
<p>"England!&#x2014;Why, that's im&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"England, yes, native of England."</p>
<p>"Recently from there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, quite recently."</p>
<p>Said the Colonel to himself, "This phantom lies like <lb/>
an expert. Purifying this kind by fire don't work. I'll <lb/>
sound him a little further, give him another chance or <lb/>
two to work his gift." Then aloud, with deep irony:</p>
<p>"Visiting our great country for recreation and <lb/>
amusement, no doubt. I suppose you find that travel- <lb/>
ing in the majestic expanses of our Far West is&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I haven't been West, and haven't been devoting <lb/>
myself to amusement with any sort of exclusiveness, I <lb/>
assure you. In fact, to merely live, an artist has got <lb/>
to work, not play."</p>
<p>"Artist!" said Hawkins to himself, thinking of the <lb/>
rifled bank; "that <i>is</i> a name for it!"</p>
<p>"Are <i>you</i> an artist?" asked the Colonel. And <lb/>
added to himself, "<i>Now</i> I'm going to catch him."</p>
<p>"In a humble way, yes."</p>
<pb n="159"/>
<p>"What line?" pursued the sly veteran.</p>
<p>"Oils."</p>
<p>"I've got him!" said Sellers to himself. Then <lb/>
aloud, "This is fortunate. Could I engage you to <lb/>
restore some of my paintings that need that attention?"</p>
<p>"I shall be very glad. Pray let me see them."</p>
<p>No shuffling, no evasion, no embarrassment, even <lb/>
under this crucial test. The Colonel was nonplussed. <lb/>
He led Tracy to a chromo which had suffered damage <lb/>
in a former owner's hands through being used as a <lb/>
lamp-mat, and said, with a flourish of his hand toward <lb/>
the picture:</p>
<p>"This del Sarto&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Is <i>that</i> a del Sarto?"</p>
<p>The Colonel bent a look of reproach upon Tracy, <lb/>
allowed it to sink home, then resumed as if there had <lb/>
been no interruption:</p>
<p>"This del Sarto is perhaps the only original of that <lb/>
sublime master in our country. You see, yourself, <lb/>
that the work is of such exceeding delicacy that the <lb/>
risk&#x2014;could&#x2014;er&#x2014;would you mind giving me a little <lb/>
example of what you can do before we&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Cheerfully, cheerfully. I will copy one of these <lb/>
marvels."</p>
<p>Water-color materials&#x2014;relics of Miss Sally's college <lb/>
life&#x2014;were brought. Tracy said he was better in oils, <lb/>
but would take a chance with these. So he was left <lb/>
alone. He began his work, but the attractions of the <lb/>
place were too strong for him, and he got up and went <lb/>
drifting about, fascinated; also amazed.</p>

<pb n="160"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XIX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Meantime</smcap> the earl and Hawkins were holding a <lb/>
troubled and anxious private consultation. The <lb/>
earl said:</p>
<p>"The mystery that bothers me is, Where did It get <lb/>
its other arm?"</p>
<p>"Yes; it worries me, too. And another thing <lb/>
troubles me&#x2014;the apparition is English. How do you <lb/>
account for that, Colonel?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, I don't know, Hawkins, I don't really <lb/>
know. It is very confusing and awful."</p>
<p>"Don't you think maybe we've waked up the wrong <lb/>
one?"</p>
<p>"The wrong one? How do you account for the <lb/>
clothes?"</p>
<p>"The clothes <i>are</i> right, there's no getting around it. <lb/>
What are we going to do? We can't collect, as I see. <lb/>
The reward is for a one-armed American. This is a <lb/>
two-armed Englishman."</p>
<p>"Well, it may be that that is not objectionable. <lb/>
You see, it isn't <i>less</i> than is called for; it is <i>more</i>, and <lb/>
so&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But he saw that this argument was weak, and <lb/>
dropped it. The friends sat brooding over their per- <lb/>
plexities some time in silence. Finally the earl's face <lb/>
began to glow with an inspiration, and he said, im- <lb/>
pressively:</p>
<p>"Hawkins, this materialization is a grander and <lb/>
<pb n="161"/>
nobler science than we have dreamed of. We have <lb/>
little imagined what a solemn and stupendous thing we <lb/>
have done. The whole secret is perfectly clear to me <lb/>
now, clear as day. <i>Every man is made up of heredities</i>, <lb/>
long-descended atoms and particles of his ancestors. <lb/>
This present materialization is incomplete. We have <lb/>
only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of this <lb/>
century."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Colonel?" cried Hawkins, <lb/>
filled with vague alarms by the old man's awe-compel- <lb/>
ling words and manner.</p>
<p>"This: We've materialized this burglar's ancestor!"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't&#x2014;don't say that. It's hideous."</p>
<p>"But it's true, Hawkins; I <i>know</i> it. Look at the <lb/>
facts. This apparition is distinctly English&#x2014;note <lb/>
that. It uses good grammar&#x2014;note that. It is an <lb/>
artist&#x2014;note that. It has the manners and carriage <lb/>
of a gentleman&#x2014;note that. Where's your cowboy? <lb/>
Answer me that."</p>
<p>"Rossmore, this is dreadful&#x2014;it's too dreadful to <lb/>
think of!"</p>
<p>"Never resurrected a rag of that burglar but the <lb/>
clothes, not a solitary rag of him but the clothes."</p>
<p>"Colonel, do you really mean&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The Colonel brought his fist down with emphasis, <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"I mean exactly this: This materialization was im- <lb/>
mature, the burglar has evaded us; this is nothing but <lb/>
a damned ancestor!"</p>
<p>He rose and walked the floor in great excitement. <lb/>
Hawkins said, plaintively:</p>
<p>"It's a bitter disappointment&#x2014;bitter."</p>
<p>"I know it. I know it, Senator; I feel it as deeply <lb/>
as anybody could. But we've got to submit&#x2014;on <lb/>
moral grounds. I need money, but God knows I am <lb/>
not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory <lb/>
<pb n="162"/>
to the punishing of a man's ancestor for crimes com- <lb/>
mitted by that ancestor's posterity."</p>
<p>"But, Colonel!" implored Hawkins, "stop and <lb/>
think; don't be rash; you know it's the <i>only</i> chance <lb/>
we've got to get the money; and, besides, the Bible <lb/>
itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be <lb/>
punished for the sins and crimes committed by ances- <lb/>
tors four generations back that hadn't anything to do <lb/>
with them; and so it's only fair to turn the rule around <lb/>
and make it work both ways."</p>
<p>The Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this <lb/>
position. He strode up and down, and thought it <lb/>
painfully over. Finally he said:</p>
<p>"There's reason in it; yes, there's reason in it. <lb/>
And so, although it seems a piteous thing to sweat this <lb/>
poor ancient devil for a burglary he hadn't the least <lb/>
hand in, still if duty commands I suppose we must give <lb/>
him up to the authorities."</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> would," said Hawkins, cheered and relieved; <lb/>
"I'd give him up if he was a thousand ancestors com- <lb/>
pacted into one."</p>
<p>"Lord bless me, that's just what he is!" said <lb/>
Sellers, with something like a groan; "it's exactly <lb/>
what he is; there's a contribution in him from every <lb/>
ancestor he ever had. In him there's atoms of priests, <lb/>
soldiers, crusaders, poets, and sweet and gracious <lb/>
women&#x2014;all kinds and conditions of folk who trod <lb/>
this earth in old, old centuries, and vanished out of it <lb/>
ages ago, and now by act of ours they are summoned <lb/>
from their holy peace to answer for gutting a one- <lb/>
horse bank away out on the borders of Cherokee Strip, <lb/>
and it's just a howling outrage!"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't talk like that, Colonel; it takes the <lb/>
heart all out of me, and makes me ashamed of the part <lb/>
I am proposing to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wait&#x2014;I've got it!"</p>
<pb n="163"/>
<p>"A saving hope? Shout it out, I am perishing."</p>
<p>"It's perfectly simple; a child would have thought <lb/>
of it. He is all right, not a flaw in him, as far as I <lb/>
have carried the work. If I've been able to bring him <lb/>
as far as the beginning of this century, what's to stop <lb/>
me now? I'll go on and materialize him down to <lb/>
date."</p>
<p>"Land, I never thought of that!" said Hawkins, <lb/>
all ablaze with joy again. "It's the very thing. What <lb/>
a brain you have got! And will he shed the super- <lb/>
fluous arm?"</p>
<p>"He will."</p>
<p>"And lose his English accent?"</p>
<p>"It will wholly disappear. He will speak Cherokee <lb/>
Strip&#x2014;and other forms of profanity."</p>
<p>"Colonel, maybe he'll confess!"</p>
<p>"Confess? Merely that bank robbery?"</p>
<p>"Merely? Yes, but why 'merely'?"</p>
<p>The Colonel said, in his most impressive manner:</p>
<p>"Hawkins, he will be wholly under my command. <lb/>
I will make him confess every crime he ever committed. <lb/>
There must be a thousand. Do you get the idea?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;not quite."</p>
<p>"The rewards will come to us."</p>
<p>"Prodigious conception! I <i>never</i> saw such a head <lb/>
for seeing with a lightning glance all the outlying rami- <lb/>
fications and possibilities of a central idea."</p>
<p>"It is nothing; it comes natural to me. When his <lb/>
time is out in one jail he goes to the next and the next, <lb/>
and we shall have nothing to do but collect the rewards <lb/>
as he goes along. It is a perfectly steady income as <lb/>
long as we live, Hawkins. And much better than <lb/>
other kinds of investments, because he is indestruc- <lb/>
tible."</p>
<p>"It looks&#x2014;it really does look the way you say; it <lb/>
does, indeed."</p>
<pb n="164"/>
<p>"Look?&#x2014;why, it <i>is</i>. It will not be denied that I <lb/>
have had a pretty wide and comprehensive financial <lb/>
experience, and I do not hesitate to say that I consider <lb/>
this one of the most valuable properties I have ever <lb/>
controlled."</p>
<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>
<p>"I do, indeed."</p>
<p>"Oh, Colonel, the wasting grind and grief of <lb/>
poverty! If we could realize immediately. I don't <lb/>
mean sell it all, but sell part&#x2014;enough, you know, <lb/>
to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"See how you tremble with excitement. That <lb/>
comes of lack of experience. My boy, when you <lb/>
have been familiar with vast operations as long as I <lb/>
have you'll be different. Look at me. Is my eye <lb/>
dilated? Do you notice a quiver anywhere? Feel my <lb/>
pulse: plunk&#x2014;plunk&#x2014;plunk&#x2014;same as if I were <lb/>
asleep. And yet, what is passing through my calm, <lb/>
cold mind? A procession of figures which would make <lb/>
a financial novice drunk&#x2014;just the sight of them. Now <lb/>
it is by keeping cool, and looking at a thing all around, <lb/>
that a man sees what's really in it, and saves himself <lb/>
from the novice's unfailing mistake&#x2014;the one you've <lb/>
just suggested&#x2014;eagerness to <i>realize</i>. Listen to me. <lb/>
Your idea is to sell a part of him for ready cash. Now <lb/>
mine is&#x2014;guess."</p>
<p>"I haven't an idea. What is it?"</p>
<p>"Stock him&#x2014;of course."</p>
<p>"Well, I should never have thought of that."</p>
<p>"Because you are not a financier. Say he has <lb/>
committed a thousand crimes. Certainly that's a low <lb/>
estimate. By the look of him, even in his unfinished <lb/>
condition, he has committed all of a million. But call <lb/>
it only a thousand to be perfectly safe; five thousand <lb/>
reward, multiplied by a thousand, gives us a dead sure <lb/>
cash basis of&#x2014;what? Five million dollars!"</p>
<pb n="165"/>
<p>"Wait&#x2014;let me get my breath."</p>
<p>"And the property indestructible. Perpetually fruit- <lb/>
ful&#x2014;perpetually; for a property with his disposition <lb/>
will go on committing crimes and winning rewards."</p>
<p>"You daze me, you make my head whirl!"</p>
<p>"Let it whirl, it won't do it any harm. Now that <lb/>
matter is all fixed&#x2014;leave it alone. I'll get up the <lb/>
company and issue the stock, all in good time. Just <lb/>
leave it in my hands. I judge you don't doubt my <lb/>
ability to work it up for all it is worth."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I don't. I can say that with truth."</p>
<p>"All right, then. That's disposed of. Everything <lb/>
in its turn. We old operators go by order and system <lb/>
&#x2014;no helter-skelter business with us. What's the next <lb/>
thing on the docket? The carrying on of the materiali- <lb/>
zation&#x2014;the bringing it down to date. I will begin on <lb/>
that at once. I think&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Look here, Rossmore. You didn't lock It in. A <lb/>
hundred to one it has escaped!"</p>
<p>"Calm yourself as to that; don't give yourself any <lb/>
uneasiness."</p>
<p>"But why shouldn't it escape?"</p>
<p>"Let it, if it wants to? What of it?"</p>
<p>"Well, <i>I</i> should consider it a pretty serious <lb/>
calamity."</p>
<p>"Why, my dear boy, once in my power, always in <lb/>
my power. It may go and come freely. I can pro- <lb/>
duce it here whenever I want it, just by the exercise of <lb/>
my will."</p>
<p>"Well, I am truly glad to hear that, I do assure <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>"Yes, I shall give it all the painting it wants to do, <lb/>
and we and the family will make it as comfortable and <lb/>
contented as we can. No occasion to restrain its <lb/>
movements. I hope to persuade it to remain pretty <lb/>
quiet, though, because a materialization which is in a <lb/>
<pb n="166"/>
state of arrested development must of necessity be <lb/>
pretty soft and flabby and substanceless, and&#x2014;er&#x2014; <lb/>
by the way, I wonder where It comes from?"</p>
<p>"How? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>The earl pointed significantly&#x2014;and interrogatively <lb/>
&#x2014;toward the sky. Hawkins started; then settled into <lb/>
deep reflection; finally shook his head sorrowfully and <lb/>
pointed downward.</p>
<p>"What makes you think so, Washington?"</p>
<p>"Well, I hardly know, but really you can see your- <lb/>
self that he doesn't seem to be pining for his last <lb/>
place."</p>
<p>"It's well thought! Soundly deduced. We've <lb/>
done that Thing a favor. But I believe I will pump <lb/>
it a little, in a quiet way, and find out if we are right."</p>
<p>"How long is it going to take to finish him off and <lb/>
fetch him down to date, Colonel?"</p>
<p>"I wish I knew, but I don't. I am clear knocked <lb/>
out by this new detail&#x2014;this unforeseen necessity of <lb/>
working a subject down gradually from his condition <lb/>
of ancestor to his ultimate result as posterity. But <lb/>
I'll make him hump himself, anyway."</p>
<p>"Rossmore!"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear. We're in the laboratory. Come&#x2014; <lb/>
Hawkins is here. Mind now, Hawkins&#x2014;he's a sound, <lb/>
living <i>human being</i> to all the family&#x2014;<i>don't</i> forget <lb/>
that. Here she comes."</p>
<p>"Keep your seats, I'm not coming in. I just <lb/>
wanted to ask, who is it that's painting down there?"</p>
<p>"That? Oh, that's a young artist; young English- <lb/>
man named Tracy; very promising&#x2014;favorite pupil of <lb/>
Hans Christian Andersen or one of the other old <lb/>
masters&#x2014;Andersen I'm pretty sure it is; he's going <lb/>
to half-sole some of our old Italian masterpieces. <lb/>
Been talking to him?"</p>
<p>"Well, only a word. I stumbled right in on him <lb/>
<pb n="167"/>
without expecting anybody was there. I tried to be <lb/>
polite to him; offered him a snack" (Sellers delivered <lb/>
a large wink to Hawkins from behind his hand), "but <lb/>
he declined, and said he wasn't hungry" (another <lb/>
sarcastic wink); "so I brought some apples" (double <lb/>
wink), "and he ate a couple of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What!" And the Colonel sprang some yards <lb/>
toward the ceiling, and came down quaking with <lb/>
astonishment.</p>
<p>Lady Rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement. <lb/>
She gazed at the sheepish relic of Cherokee Strip, then <lb/>
at her husband, and then at the guest again. Finally <lb/>
she said:</p>
<p>"What is the matter with you, Mulberry?"</p>
<p>He did not answer immediately. His back was <lb/>
turned; he was bending over his chair, feeling the seat <lb/>
of it. But he answered next moment, and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, there it is; it was a tack."</p>
<p>The lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment, <lb/>
then said, pretty snappishly:</p>
<p>"All that for a tack! Praise goodness it wasn't a <lb/>
shingle nail, it would have landed you in the Milky <lb/>
Way. I do hate to have my nerves shook up so." <lb/>
And she turned on her heel and went her way.</p>
<p>As soon as she was safely out, the Colonel said in a <lb/>
suppressed voice:</p>
<p>"Come&#x2014;we must see for ourselves. It <i>must</i> be a <lb/>
mistake."</p>
<p>They hurried softly down and peeped in. Sellers <lb/>
whispered, in a sort of despair:</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> eating! What a grisly spectacle! Hawkins, <lb/>
it's horrible! Take me away&#x2014;I can't stand it."</p>
<p>They tottered back to the laboratory.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XX.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Tracy</smcap> made slow progress with his work, for his <lb/>
mind wandered a good deal. Many things were <lb/>
puzzling him. Finally a light burst upon him all of a <lb/>
sudden&#x2014;seemed to, at any rate&#x2014;and he said to <lb/>
himself, "I've got the clew at last&#x2014;this man's mind <lb/>
is off its balance; I don't know how much, but it's off <lb/>
a point or two, sure; off enough to explain this mess <lb/>
of perplexities, anyway. These dreadful chromos&#x2014; <lb/>
which he takes for old masters; these villainous por- <lb/>
traits&#x2014;which to his frantic mind represent Rossmores; <lb/>
the hatchments; the pompous name of this ramshackle <lb/>
old crib&#x2014;Rossmore Towers; and that odd assertion <lb/>
of his, that I was expected. How could I be ex- <lb/>
pected? that is, Lord Berkeley. He knows by the <lb/>
papers that that person was burned up in the New <lb/>
Gadsby. Why, hang it, he really doesn't know <i>whom</i> <lb/>
he was expecting; for his talk showed that he was not <lb/>
expecting an Englishman, or yet an artist, yet I answer <lb/>
his requirements notwithstanding. He seems suffi- <lb/>
ciently satisfied with me. Yes, he is a little off; in <lb/>
fact, I am afraid he is a good deal off, poor old gentle- <lb/>
man. But he's interesting&#x2014;all people in about his <lb/>
condition are, I suppose. I hope he'll like my work; <lb/>
I would like to come every day and study him. And <lb/>
when I write my father&#x2014;ah, that hurts! I mustn't <lb/>
get on that subject; it isn't good for my spirits. <lb/>
Somebody coming&#x2014;I must get to work. It's the old <lb/>
<pb n="169"/>
gentleman again. He looks bothered. Maybe my <lb/>
clothes are suspicious; and they are&#x2014;for an artist. <lb/>
If my conscience would allow me to make a change&#x2014; <lb/>
but that is out of the question. I wonder what he's <lb/>
making those passes in the air for with his hands. I <lb/>
seem to be the object of them. Can he be trying to <lb/>
mesmerize me? I don't quite like it. There's some- <lb/>
thing uncanny about it."</p>
<p>The Colonel muttered to himself, "It has an effect <lb/>
on him, I can see it myself. That's enough for one <lb/>
time, I reckon. He's not very solid yet I suppose, <lb/>
and I might disintegrate him. I'll just put a sly ques- <lb/>
tion or two at him now, and see if I can find out what <lb/>
his condition is and where he's from."</p>
<p>He approached and said, affably:</p>
<p>"Don't let me disturb you, Mr. Tracy; I only want <lb/>
to take a little glimpse of your work. Ah, that's fine <lb/>
&#x2014;that's very fine, indeed. You are doing it elegantly. <lb/>
My daughter will be charmed with this. May I sit <lb/>
down by you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, do; I shall be glad."</p>
<p>"It won't disturb you? I mean, won't dissipate <lb/>
your inspirations?"</p>
<p>Tracy laughed and said they were not ethereal <lb/>
enough to be very easily discommoded.</p>
<p>The Colonel asked a number of cautious and well- <lb/>
considered questions&#x2014;questions which seemed pretty <lb/>
odd and flighty to Tracy&#x2014;but the answers conveyed <lb/>
the information desired apparently, for the Colonel <lb/>
said to himself, with mixed pride and gratification:</p>
<p>"It's a good job as far as I've got with it. He's <lb/>
solid. Solid, and going to last; solid as the real <lb/>
thing. It's wonderful&#x2014;wonderful. I believe I could <lb/>
petrify him."</p>
<p>After a little he asked, warily:</p>
<p>"Do you prefer being here, or&#x2014;or there?"</p>
<pb n="170"/>
<p>"There? Where?"</p>
<p>"Why&#x2014;er&#x2014;where you've been?"</p>
<p>Tracy's thought flew to his boarding house, and he <lb/>
answered with decision:</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>here</i>, much!"</p>
<p>The Colonel was startled, and said to himself, <lb/>
"There's no uncertain ring about that. It indicates <lb/>
where <i>he's</i> been to, poor fellow. Well, I am satisfied <lb/>
now. I'm glad I got him out."</p>
<p>He sat thinking and thinking, and watching the <lb/>
brush go. At length he said to himself, "Yes, it <lb/>
certainly seems to account for the failure of my en- <lb/>
deavors in poor Berkeley's case. <i>He</i> went in the other <lb/>
direction. Well, it's all right. He's better off."</p>
<p>Sally Sellers entered from the street now, looking <lb/>
her divinest, and the artist was introduced to her. It <lb/>
was a violent case of mutual love at first sight, though <lb/>
neither party was entirely aware of the fact, perhaps. <lb/>
The Englishman made this irrelevant remark to him- <lb/>
self: "Perhaps he is not insane, after all." Sally sat <lb/>
down and showed an interest in Tracy's work which <lb/>
greatly pleased him, and benevolent forgiveness of it <lb/>
which convinced him that the girl's nature was cast in <lb/>
a large mould. Sellers was anxious to report his dis- <lb/>
coveries to Hawkins; so he took his leave, saying that <lb/>
if the two "young devotees of the colored Muse" <lb/>
thought they could manage without him, he would go <lb/>
and look after his affairs. The artist said to himself, <lb/>
"I think he <i>is</i> a little eccentric, perhaps, but that is <lb/>
all." He reproached himself for having injuriously <lb/>
judged a man without giving him any fair chance to <lb/>
show what he really was.</p>
<p>Of course the stranger was very soon at his ease and <lb/>
chatting along comfortably. The average American <lb/>
girl possesses the valuable qualities of naturalness, <lb/>
honesty, and inoffensive straightforwardness; she is</p>
<pb/>
<pb/>
<p><i>Colonel Sellers introduces Sally to Lord Berkeley</i></p>
<pb/>
<figure/>
<pb/>
<pb n="171"/>
<p>nearly barren of troublesome conventions and artificial- <lb/>
ities; consequently, her presence and her ways are <lb/>
unembarrassing, and one is acquainted with her and on <lb/>
the pleasantest terms with her before he knows how it <lb/>
came about. This new acquaintanceship&#x2014;friendship, <lb/>
indeed&#x2014;progressed swiftly; and the unusual swiftness <lb/>
of it and the thoroughness of it are sufficiently evi- <lb/>
denced and established by one noteworthy fact&#x2014;that <lb/>
within the first half hour both parties had ceased to be <lb/>
conscious of Tracy's clothes. Later this consciousness <lb/>
was reawakened; it was then apparent to Gwendolen <lb/>
that she was almost reconciled to them, and it was ap- <lb/>
parent to Tracy that he wasn't. The reawakening was <lb/>
brought about by Gwendolen's inviting the artist to <lb/>
stay to dinner. He had to decline because he wanted <lb/>
to live now&#x2014;that is, now that there was something to <lb/>
live for&#x2014;and he could not survive in those clothes at <lb/>
a gentleman's table. He thought he knew that. But <lb/>
he went away happy, for he saw that Gwendolen was <lb/>
disappointed.</p>
<p>And whither did he go? He went straight to a <lb/>
slop-shop and bought as neat and reasonably well-fitting <lb/>
a suit of clothes as an Englishman could be persuaded <lb/>
to wear. He said&#x2014;<i>to</i> himself, but <i>at</i> his conscience&#x2014; <lb/>
"I know it's wrong; but it would be wrong <i>not</i> to do <lb/>
it; and two wrongs do not make a right."</p>
<p>This satisfied him, and made his heart light. Per- <lb/>
haps it will also satisfy the reader&#x2014;if he can make <lb/>
out what it means.</p>
<p>The old people were troubled about Gwendolen at <lb/>
dinner, because she was so distraught and silent. If <lb/>
they had noticed, they would have found that she was <lb/>
sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk <lb/>
stumbled upon the artist and his work; but they <lb/>
didn't notice, and so the chat would swap around to <lb/>
some other subject, and then somebody would pres- <lb/>
<pb n="172"/>
ently be privately worrying about Gwendolen again, <lb/>
and wondering if she were not well, or if something <lb/>
had gone wrong in the millinery line. Her mother <lb/>
offered her various reputable patent medicines and tonics <lb/>
with iron and other hardware in them, and her father <lb/>
even proposed to send out for wine, relentless prohibi- <lb/>
tionist and head of the order in the District of Columbia <lb/>
as he was, but these kindnesses were all declined&#x2014; <lb/>
thankfully, but with decision. At bedtime, when the <lb/>
family were breaking up for the night, she privately <lb/>
looted one of the brushes, saying to herself, "It's the <lb/>
one he has used the most."</p>
<p>The next morning Tracy went forth wearing his new <lb/>
suit, and equipped with a pink in his button-hole&#x2014;a <lb/>
daily attention from Puss. His whole soul was full of <lb/>
Gwendolen Sellers, and this condition was an inspira- <lb/>
tion, art-wise. All the morning his brush pawed nimbly <lb/>
away at the canvases, almost without his awarity&#x2014; <lb/>
awarity, in this sense, being the sense of being aware, <lb/>
though disputed by some authorities&#x2014;turning out <lb/>
marvel upon marvel, in the way of decorative acces- <lb/>
sories to the portraits, with a felicity and celerity which <lb/>
amazed the veterans of the firm and fetched out of <lb/>
them continuous explosions of applause.</p>
<p>Meantime Gwendolen was losing her morning and <lb/>
many dollars. She supposed Tracy was coming in the <lb/>
forenoon&#x2014;a conclusion which she had jumped to <lb/>
without outside help. So she tripped down stairs <lb/>
every little while from her work-parlor to arrange the <lb/>
brushes and things over again and see if he had arrived. <lb/>
And when she was in her work-parlor it was not profit- <lb/>
able, but just the other way&#x2014;as she found out to her <lb/>
sorrow. She had put in her idle moments during the <lb/>
last little while back in designing a particularly rare <lb/>
and capable gown for herself, and this morning she set <lb/>
about making it up; but she was absentminded, and <lb/>
<pb n="173"/>
made an irremediable botch of it. When she saw what <lb/>
she had done she knew the reason of it and the mean- <lb/>
ing of it, and she put her work away from her and said <lb/>
she would accept the sign. And from that time forth <lb/>
she came no more away from the Audience Chamber, <lb/>
but remained there and waited. After luncheon she <lb/>
waited again. A whole hour. Then a great joy welled <lb/>
up in her heart, for she saw him coming. So she flew <lb/>
back up stairs thankful, and could hardly wait for him <lb/>
to miss the principal brush, which she had mislaid <lb/>
down there, but knew where she had mislaid it. How- <lb/>
ever, all in good time the others were called in and <lb/>
couldn't find the brush, and then she was sent for, and <lb/>
she couldn't find it herself for some little time; but <lb/>
then she found it when the others had gone away to <lb/>
hunt in the kitchen and down cellar and in the wood- <lb/>
shed, and all those other places where people look for <lb/>
things whose ways they are not familiar with. So she <lb/>
gave him the brush, and remarked that she ought to <lb/>
have seen that everything was ready for him, but it <lb/>
hadn't seemed necessary, because it was so early that <lb/>
she wasn't expecting&#x2014;but she stopped there, sur- <lb/>
prised at herself for what she was saying; and he felt <lb/>
caught and ashamed, and said to himself, "I knew my <lb/>
impatience would drag me here before I was expected <lb/>
and betray me, and that is just what it has done; she <lb/>
sees straight through me&#x2014;and is laughing at me <lb/>
inside, of course."</p>
<p>Gwendolen was very much pleased on one account, <lb/>
and a little the other way in another; pleased with the <lb/>
new clothes and the improvement which they had <lb/>
achieved; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole. <lb/>
Yesterday's pink had hardly interested her; this one <lb/>
was just like it, but somehow it had got her immediate <lb/>
attention, and kept it. She wished she could think of <lb/>
some way of getting at its history in a properly color- <lb/>
<pb n="174"/>
less and indifferent way. Presently she made a ven- <lb/>
ture. She said:</p>
<p>"Whatever a man's age may be, he can reduce it <lb/>
several years by putting a bright-colored flower in his <lb/>
buttonhole. I have often noticed that. Is that your <lb/>
sex's reason for wearing a boutonni&#x00E8;re?"</p>
<p>"I fancy not, but certainly that reason would be a <lb/>
sufficient one. I've never heard of the idea before."</p>
<p>"You seem to prefer pinks. Is it on account of the <lb/>
color, or the form?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," he said, simply, "they are given to me. <lb/>
I don't think I have any preference."</p>
<p>"They are given to him," she said to herself, and <lb/>
she felt a coldness towards that pink. "I wonder who <lb/>
it is, and what she is like." The flower began to take <lb/>
up a good deal of room; it obtruded itself everywhere; <lb/>
it intercepted all views, and marred them; it was be- <lb/>
coming exceedingly annoying and conspicuous for a <lb/>
little thing. "I wonder if he cares for her." That <lb/>
thought gave her a quite definite pain.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XXI">
<pb n="175"/>
<head><b>CHAPTER XXI.</b></head>
<p><smcap>She</smcap> had made everything comfortable for the artist; <lb/>
there was no further pretext for staying. So she <lb/>
said she would go now, and asked him to summon the <lb/>
servants in case he should need anything. She went <lb/>
away unhappy, and she left unhappiness behind her; <lb/>
for she carried away all the sunshine. The time <lb/>
dragged heavily for both now. He couldn't paint for <lb/>
thinking of her; she couldn't design or millinerize with <lb/>
any heart for thinking of him. Never before had <lb/>
painting seemed so empty to him, never before had <lb/>
millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her. She <lb/>
had gone without repeating that dinner-invitation&#x2014;an <lb/>
almost unendurable disappointment to him. On her <lb/>
part&#x2014;well, she was suffering, too; for she had found <lb/>
she <i>couldn't</i> invite him. It was not hard yesterday, <lb/>
but it was impossible to-day. A thousand innocent <lb/>
privileges seemed to have been filched from her un- <lb/>
awares in the past twenty-four hours. To-day she felt <lb/>
strangely hampered, restrained of her liberty. To-day <lb/>
she couldn't propose to herself to do anything or say <lb/>
anything concerning this young man without being <lb/>
instantly paralyzed into non-action by the fear that he <lb/>
might "suspect." Invite him to dinner <i>to-day?</i> It <lb/>
made her shiver to think of it.</p>
<p>And so her afternoon was one long fret&#x2014;broken at <lb/>
intervals. Three times she had to go downstairs on <lb/>
errands&#x2014;that is, she thought she had to go down- <lb/>
<pb n="176"/>
stairs on errands. Thus, going and coming, she had <lb/>
six glimpses of him in the aggregate, without seeming <lb/>
to look in his direction; and she tried to endure these <lb/>
electric ecstasies without showing any sign, but they <lb/>
fluttered her up a good deal, and she felt that the <lb/>
naturalness she was putting on was overdone and quite <lb/>
too frantically sober and hysterically calm to deceive.</p>
<p>The painter had his share of the rapture; he had his <lb/>
six glimpses, and they smote him with waves of <lb/>
pleasure that assaulted him, beat upon him, washed <lb/>
over him deliciously, and drowned out all conscious- <lb/>
ness of what he was doing with his brush. So there <lb/>
were six places in his canvas which had to be done <lb/>
over again.</p>
<p>At last Gwendolen got some peace of mind by send- <lb/>
ing word to the Thompsons, in the neighborhood, that <lb/>
she was coming there to dinner. She wouldn't be re- <lb/>
minded, at <i>that</i> table, that there was an absentee who <lb/>
ought to be a presentee&#x2014;a word which she meant to <lb/>
look out in the dictionary at a calmer time.</p>
<p>About this time the old earl dropped in for a chat <lb/>
with the artist, and invited him to stay to dinner. <lb/>
Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude by a sudden <lb/>
and powerful exercise of all his forces; and he felt that <lb/>
now that he was going to be close to Gwendolen, and <lb/>
hear her voice and watch her face during several <lb/>
precious hours, earth had nothing valuable to add to <lb/>
his life for the present.</p>
<p>The earl said to himself, "This specter can eat <lb/>
apples, apparently. We shall find out now if that is a <lb/>
specialty. I think, myself, it's a specialty. Apples, <lb/>
without doubt, constitute the spectral limit. It was the <lb/>
case with our first parents. No, I am wrong&#x2014;at <lb/>
least, only partly right. The line <i>was</i> drawn at apples, <lb/>
just as in the present case, but it was from the other <lb/>
direction." The new clothes gave him a thrill of <lb/>
<pb n="177"/>
pleasure and pride. He said to himself, "I've got <lb/>
part of him down to date, anyway."</p>
<p>Sellers said he was pleased with Tracy's work; and <lb/>
he went on and engaged him to restore his old masters, <lb/>
and said he should also want him to paint his portrait <lb/>
and his wife's and possibly his daughter's. The tide <lb/>
of the artist's happiness was at flood now. The chat <lb/>
flowed pleasantly along while Tracy painted and Sellers <lb/>
carefully unpacked a picture which he had brought <lb/>
with him. It was a chromo; a new one, just out. It <lb/>
was the smirking, self-satisfied portrait of a man who <lb/>
was inundating the Union with advertisements inviting <lb/>
everybody to buy his specialty, which was a three- <lb/>
dollar shoe or a dress-suit or something of that kind. <lb/>
The old gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap <lb/>
and gazed down tenderly upon it, and became silent <lb/>
and meditative. Presently Tracy noticed that he was <lb/>
dripping tears on it. This touched the young fellow's <lb/>
sympathetic nature, and at the same time gave him the <lb/>
painful sense of being an intruder upon a sacred <lb/>
privacy, an observer of emotions which a stranger <lb/>
ought not to witness. But his pity rose superior to <lb/>
other considerations, and compelled him to try to com- <lb/>
fort the old mourner with kindly words and a show of <lb/>
friendly interest. He said:</p>
<p>"I am very sorry&#x2014;it is a friend whom&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Ah, more than that, far more than that&#x2014;a rela- <lb/>
tive, the dearest I had on earth, although I was never <lb/>
permitted to see him. Yes, it is young Lord Berkeley, <lb/>
who perished so heroically in the awful confla&#x2014; <lb/>
Why, what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing. It was a little startling to <lb/>
be so suddenly brought face to face, so to speak, with <lb/>
a person one has heard so much talk about. Is it a <lb/>
good likeness?"</p>
<p>"Without doubt, yes. I never saw him, but you <lb/>
<pb n="178"/>
can easily see the resemblance to his father," said <lb/>
Sellers, holding up the chromo, and glancing from it <lb/>
to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl, and <lb/>
back again with an approving eye.</p>
<p>"Well, no&#x2014;I am not sure that I make out the like- <lb/>
ness. It is plain that the Usurping Earl there has a <lb/>
great deal of character and a long face like a horse's, <lb/>
whereas his heir here is smirky, moon-faced, and <lb/>
characterless."</p>
<p>"We are all that way in the beginning&#x2014;all the <lb/>
line," said Sellers, undisturbed. "We all start as <lb/>
moon-faced fools, then later we tadpole along into <lb/>
horse-faced marvels of intellect and character. It is <lb/>
by that sign and by that fact that I detect the resem- <lb/>
blance here, and know this portrait to be genuine and <lb/>
perfect. Yes, all our family are fools at first."</p>
<p>"This young man seems to meet the hereditary re- <lb/>
quirement, certainly."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, he was a fool, without any doubt. <lb/>
Examine the face, the shape of the head, the expres- <lb/>
sion. It's all fool, fool, fool, straight through."</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Tracy, involuntarily.</p>
<p>"Thanks?"</p>
<p>"I mean for explaining it to me. Go on, please."</p>
<p>"As I was saying, fool is printed all over the face. <lb/>
A body can even read the <i>de</i>tails."</p>
<p>"What do they say?"</p>
<p>"Well, added up, he is a wobbler."</p>
<p>"A which?"</p>
<p>"Wobbler. A person that's always taking a firm <lb/>
stand about something or other&#x2014;kind of a Gibraltar <lb/>
stand, <i>he</i> thinks, for unshakable fidelity and everlasting- <lb/>
ness&#x2014;and then, inside of a little while, he begins to <lb/>
wobble; no more Gibraltar there; no, sir, a mighty <lb/>
ordinary commonplace weakling wobbling around on <lb/>
stilts. That's Lord Berkeley to a dot, you can <i>see</i> it&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="179"/>
<i>look</i> at that sheep! But&#x2014;why are you blushing like <lb/>
sunset? Dear sir, have I unwittingly offended in some <lb/>
way?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no indeed, no indeed. Far from it. But it <lb/>
always makes me blush to hear a man revile his own <lb/>
blood." He said to himself, "How strangely his <lb/>
vagrant and unguided fancies have hit upon the truth. <lb/>
By accident he has described me. I am that contemp- <lb/>
tible thing. When I left England I thought I knew <lb/>
myself; I thought I was a very Frederick the Great for <lb/>
resolution and staying capacity; whereas in truth I am <lb/>
just a Wobbler, simply a Wobbler. Well&#x2014;after all, <lb/>
it is at least creditable to <i>have</i> high ideals and give <lb/>
birth to lofty resolutions; I will allow myself that com- <lb/>
fort." Then he said aloud, "Could this sheep, as you <lb/>
call him, breed a great and self-sacrificing idea in his <lb/>
head, do you think? Could he meditate such a thing, <lb/>
for instance, as the renunciation of the earldom and its <lb/>
wealth and its glories, and voluntary retirement to the <lb/>
ranks of the commonalty, there to rise by his own <lb/>
merit or remain forever poor and obscure?"</p>
<p>"<i>Could</i> he? Why, look at him&#x2014;look at this <lb/>
simpering, self-righteous mug! There is your answer. <lb/>
It's the very thing he would think of. And he would <lb/>
start in to do it, too."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"He'd wobble."</p>
<p>"And back down?"</p>
<p>"Every time."</p>
<p>"Is that to happen with <i>all</i> my&#x2014;I mean would <lb/>
that happen to <i>all</i> his high resolutions?"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly&#x2014;certainly. It's the Rossmore of <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>"Then this creature was fortunate to die! Suppose, <lb/>
for argument's sake, that I was a Rossmore, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"It can't be done."</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because it's not a supposable case. To be a Ross- <lb/>
more at your age you'd have to be a fool, and you're <lb/>
not a fool. And you'd have to be a Wobbler, whereas <lb/>
anybody that is an expert in reading character can see <lb/>
at a glance that when you set your foot down once, <lb/>
it's there to stay; an earthquake can't wobble it." <lb/>
He added to himself, "That's enough to say to him, <lb/>
but it isn't half strong enough for the facts. The more <lb/>
I observe him now the more remarkable I find him. It <lb/>
is the strongest face I have ever examined. There is <lb/>
almost superhuman firmness here, immovable purpose, <lb/>
iron steadfastness of will. A most extraordinary young <lb/>
man."</p>
<p>He presently said, aloud:</p>
<p>"Some time I want to ask your advice about a little <lb/>
matter, Mr. Tracy. You see, I've got that young <lb/>
lord's remains&#x2014;my goodness, how you jump!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's nothing, pray go on. You've got his <lb/>
remains?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Are you sure they are his, and not somebody <lb/>
else's?"</p>
<p>"Oh, perfectly sure. Samples, I mean. Not all <lb/>
of him."</p>
<p>"Samples?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;in baskets. Some time you will be going <lb/>
home; and if you wouldn't mind taking them along&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Who? I?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;certainly. I don't mean <i>now;</i> but after a <lb/>
while; after&#x2014;but look here, would you like to see <lb/>
them?"</p>
<p>"No! Most certainly not. I don't want to see <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well. I only thought. Heyo, where are <lb/>
you going, dear?"</p>
<pb n="181"/>
<p>"Out to dinner, papa."</p>
<p>Tracy was aghast. The Colonel said, in a disap- <lb/>
pointed voice:</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sorry. Sho, I didn't know she was <lb/>
going out, Mr. Tracy." Gwendolen's face began to <lb/>
take on a sort of apprehensive What-have-I-done ex- <lb/>
pression. "Three old people to one young one&#x2014; <lb/>
well, it <i>isn't</i> a good team, that's a fact." Gwendolen's <lb/>
face betrayed a dawning hopefulness, and she said, <lb/>
with a tone of reluctance which hadn't the hall-mark <lb/>
on it:</p>
<p>"If you prefer, I will send word to the Thompsons <lb/>
that I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, is it the Thompsons? That simplifies it&#x2014; <lb/>
sets everything right. We can fix it without spoiling <lb/>
your arrangements, my child. You've got your heart <lb/>
set on&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But, papa, I'd <i>just</i> as soon go there some other&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No, I won't have it. You are a good, hardwork- <lb/>
ing, darling child, and your father is not the man to <lb/>
disappoint you when you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But, papa, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Go along, I won't hear a word. We'll get along, <lb/>
dear."</p>
<p>Gwendolen was ready to cry with vexation. But <lb/>
there was nothing to do but start; which she was about <lb/>
to do when her father hit upon an idea which filled him <lb/>
with delight because it so deftly covered all the diffi- <lb/>
culties of the sitation, and made things smooth and <lb/>
satisfactory:</p>
<p>"I've got it, my love, so that you won't be robbed <lb/>
of your holiday, and at the same time we'll be pretty <lb/>
satisfactorily fixed for a good time here. You send <lb/>
Belle Thompson here&#x2014;perfectly beautiful creature, <lb/>
Tracy, per-fectly beautiful. I want you to see that <lb/>
girl; why, you'll just go mad&#x2014;you'll go mad inside <lb/>
<pb n="182"/>
of a minute. Yes, you send her right along, Gwen- <lb/>
dolen, and tell her&#x2014;Why, she's gone!" He turned <lb/>
&#x2014;she was already passing out at the gate. He mut- <lb/>
tered, "I wonder what's the matter; I don't know <lb/>
what her mouth's doing, but I think her shoulders are <lb/>
swearing. Well," said Sellers, blithely, to Tracy, "I <lb/>
shall miss her&#x2014;parents always miss the children as <lb/>
soon as they're out of sight; it's only a natural and <lb/>
wisely ordained partiality; but you'll be all right, be- <lb/>
cause Miss Belle will supply the youthful element for <lb/>
you and to your entire content; and we old people <lb/>
will do our best, too. We shall have a good enough <lb/>
time. And you'll have a chance to get better ac- <lb/>
quainted with Admiral Hawkins. That's a rare char- <lb/>
acter, Mr. Tracy&#x2014;one of the rarest and most engaging <lb/>
characters the world has produced. You'll find him <lb/>
worth studying. I've studied him ever since he was a <lb/>
child, and have always found him developing. I really <lb/>
consider that one of the main things that has enabled <lb/>
me to master the difficult science of character-reading <lb/>
was the vivid interest I always felt in that boy, and the <lb/>
baffling inscrutabilities of his ways and inspirations."</p>
<p>Tracy was not hearing a word. His spirits were <lb/>
gone, he was desolate.</p>
<p>"Yes, a most wonderful character. Concealment&#x2014; <lb/>
that's the basis of it. Always the first thing you want <lb/>
to do is to find the keystone a man's character is <lb/>
built on&#x2014;then you've got it. No misleading and ap- <lb/>
parently inconsistent peculiarities can fool you then. <lb/>
What do you read on the Senator's surface? Simplicity <lb/>
&#x2014;a kind of rank and protuberant simplicity; whereas, <lb/>
in fact, that's one of the deepest minds in the world, <lb/>
a perfectly honest man&#x2014;an absolutely honest and <lb/>
honorable man&#x2014;and yet, without doubt, the pro- <lb/>
foundest master of dissimulation the world has ever <lb/>
seen."</p>
<pb n="183"/>
<p>"Oh, it's devilish!" This was wrung from the un- <lb/>
listening Tracy by the anguished thought of what might <lb/>
have been if only the dinner arrangements hadn't got <lb/>
mixed.</p>
<p>"No, I shouldn't call it that," said Sellers, who <lb/>
was now placidly walking up and down the room with <lb/>
his hands under his coat-tails and listening to himself <lb/>
talk. "One could quite properly call it devilish in <lb/>
another man, but not in the Senator. Your <i>term</i> is <lb/>
right, perfectly right&#x2014;I grant that; but the applica- <lb/>
tion is wrong. It makes a great difference. Yes, he <lb/>
is a marvelous character. I do not suppose that any <lb/>
other statesman ever had such a colossal sense of <lb/>
humor, combined with the ability to totally conceal it. <lb/>
I may except George Washington and Cromwell, and <lb/>
perhaps Robespierre, but I draw the line there. A <lb/>
person not an expert might be in Judge Hawkins's <lb/>
company a lifetime and never find out he had any <lb/>
more sense of humor than a cemetery."</p>
<p>A deep-drawn, yard-long sigh from the distraught <lb/>
and dreaming artist, followed by a murmured "Miser- <lb/>
able, oh, miserable!"</p>
<p>"Well, no, I shouldn't say <i>that</i> about it, quite. On <lb/>
the contrary, I admire his ability to conceal his humor <lb/>
even more if possible than I admire the gift itself, <lb/>
stupendous as it is. Another thing&#x2014;General Hawkins <lb/>
is a thinker; a keen, logical, exhaustive, analytical <lb/>
thinker&#x2014;perhaps the ablest of modern times. That <lb/>
is, of course, upon themes suited to his size, like the <lb/>
glacial period, and the correlation of forces, and the <lb/>
evolution of the Christian from the caterpillar&#x2014;any <lb/>
of those things; give him a subject according to his <lb/>
size, and just stand back and watch him think! Why, <lb/>
you can see the place rock! Ah, yes, you must know <lb/>
him; you must get on the inside of him. Perhaps the <lb/>
most extraordinary mind since Aristotle."</p>
<pb n="184"/>
<p>Dinner was kept waiting for a while for Miss Thomp- <lb/>
son, but as Gwendolen had not delivered the invitation <lb/>
to her the waiting did no good, and the household <lb/>
presently went to the meal without her. Poor old <lb/>
Sellers tried everything his hospitable soul could <lb/>
devise to make the occasion an enjoyable one for the <lb/>
guest, and the guest tried his honest best to be cheery <lb/>
and chatty and happy for the old gentleman's sake; in <lb/>
fact, all hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual <lb/>
good time, but the thing was a failure from the start; <lb/>
Tracy's heart was lead in his bosom; there seemed to <lb/>
be only one prominent feature in the landscape, and <lb/>
that was a vacant chair; he couldn't drag his mind <lb/>
away from Gwendolen and his hard luck; consequently, <lb/>
his distractions allowed deadly pauses to slip in every <lb/>
now and then when it was his turn to say something, <lb/>
and of course this disease spread to the rest of the <lb/>
conversation&#x2014;wherefore, instead of having a breezy <lb/>
sail in sunny waters, as anticipated, everybody was <lb/>
bailing out and praying for land. What <i>could</i> the <lb/>
matter be? Tracy alone could have told, the others <lb/>
couldn't even invent a theory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time <lb/>
at the Thompson house; in fact, a twin experience. <lb/>
Gwendolen was ashamed of herself for allowing her <lb/>
disappointment to so depress her spirits, and make her <lb/>
so strangely and profoundly miserable; but feeling <lb/>
ashamed of herself didn't improve the matter any; it <lb/>
only seemed to aggravate the suffering. She explained <lb/>
that she was not feeling very well, and everybody could <lb/>
see that this was true; so she got sincere sympathy <lb/>
and commiseration; but that didn't help the case. <lb/>
Nothing helps that kind of a case. It is best to just <lb/>
stand off and let it fester. The moment the dinner <lb/>
was over the girl excused herself, and she hurried <lb/>
home, feeling unspeakably grateful to get away from <lb/>
<pb n="185"/>
that house and that intolerable captivity and suffer- <lb/>
ing.</p>
<p>Will he be gone? The thought arose in her brain <lb/>
but took effect in her heels. She slipped into the <lb/>
house, threw off her things, and made straight for the <lb/>
dining-room. She stopped and listened. Her father's <lb/>
voice&#x2014;with no life in it; presently her mother's&#x2014; <lb/>
no life in that; a considerable vacancy, then a sterile <lb/>
remark from Washington Hawkins. Another silence; <lb/>
then, not Tracy's but her father's voice again.</p>
<p>"He's gone," she said to herself, despairingly, and <lb/>
listlessly opened the door and stepped within.</p>
<p>"Why, my child," cried the mother, "how white <lb/>
you are! Are you&#x2014;has anything&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"White?" exclaimed Sellers. "It's gone like a <lb/>
flash; 'twasn't serious. Already she's as red as the <lb/>
soul of a watermelon! Sit down, dear, sit down&#x2014; <lb/>
goodness knows you're welcome. Did you have a <lb/>
good time? We've had great times here&#x2014;immense. <lb/>
Why didn't Miss Belle come? Mr. Tracy is not feel- <lb/>
ing well, and she'd have made him forget it."</p>
<p>She was content now; and out from her happy eyes <lb/>
there went a light that told a secret to another pair of <lb/>
eyes there and got a secret in return. In just that <lb/>
infinitely small fraction of a second those two great <lb/>
confessions were made, received and perfectly under- <lb/>
stood. All anxiety, apprehension, uncertainty, vanished <lb/>
out of these young people's hearts and left them filled <lb/>
with a great peace.</p>
<p>Sellers had had the most confident faith that with <lb/>
the new reinforcement victory would be at this last <lb/>
moment snatched from the jaws of defeat, but it was <lb/>
an error. The talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever. <lb/>
He was proud of Gwendolen, and liked to show her off, <lb/>
even against Miss Belle Thompson, and here had been a <lb/>
great opportunity, and what had she made of it? He <lb/>
<pb n="186"/>
felt a good deal put out. It vexed him to think that <lb/>
this Englishman, with the traveling Briton's everlasting <lb/>
disposition to generalize whole mountain ranges from <lb/>
single sample-grains of sand, would jump to the con- <lb/>
clusion that American girls were as dumb as himself&#x2014; <lb/>
generalizing the whole tribe from this single sample, <lb/>
and she at her poorest, there being nothing at that <lb/>
table to inspire her, give her a start, keep her from <lb/>
going to sleep. He made up his mind that for the <lb/>
honor of the country he would bring these two together <lb/>
again over the social board before long. There would <lb/>
be a different result another time, he judged. He said <lb/>
to himself, with a deep sense of injury, "He'll put in <lb/>
his diary&#x2014;they all keep diaries&#x2014;he'll put in his <lb/>
diary that she was miraculously uninteresting&#x2014;dear, <lb/>
dear, but <i>wasn't</i> she!&#x2014;I never saw the like&#x2014;and <lb/>
yet looking as beautiful as Satan, too&#x2014;and couldn't <lb/>
seem to do anything but paw bread crumbs, and pick <lb/>
flowers to pieces, and look fidgety. And it isn't any <lb/>
better here in the Hall of Audience. I've had enough; <lb/>
I'll haul down my flag; the others may fight it out if <lb/>
they want to."</p>
<p>He shook hands all around and went off to do some <lb/>
work which he said was pressing. The idolaters were <lb/>
the width of the room apart, and apparently uncon- <lb/>
scious of each other's presence. The distance got <lb/>
shortened a little now. Very soon the mother with- <lb/>
drew. The distance narrowed again. Tracy stood be- <lb/>
fore a chromo of some Ohio politician which had been <lb/>
retouched and chain-mailed for a crusading Rossmore, <lb/>
and Gwendolen was sitting on the sofa not far from his <lb/>
elbow, artificially absorbed in examining a photograph <lb/>
album that hadn't any photographs in it.</p>
<p>The "Senator" still lingered. He was sorry for <lb/>
the young people; it had been a dull evening for them. <lb/>
In the goodness of his heart he tried to make it pleasant <lb/>
<pb n="187"/>
for them now; tried to remove the ill-impression neces- <lb/>
sarily left by the general defeat; tried to be chatty, <lb/>
even tried to be gay. But the responses were sickly, <lb/>
there was no starting any enthusiasm; he would give it <lb/>
up and quit&#x2014;it was a day specially picked out and <lb/>
consecrated to failures.</p>
<p>But when Gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a <lb/>
glad smile, and said, with thankfulness and blessing, <lb/>
"<i>Must</i> you go?" it seemed cruel to desert, and he sat <lb/>
down again.</p>
<p>He was about to begin a remark when&#x2014;when he <lb/>
didn't. We have all been there. He didn't know how <lb/>
he knew his concluding to stay longer had been a mis- <lb/>
take, he merely knew it; and knew it for dead certain, <lb/>
too. And so he bade good night and went mooning <lb/>
out, wondering what he could have done that changed <lb/>
the atmosphere that way. As the door closed behind <lb/>
him those two were standing side by side, looking at <lb/>
that door&#x2014;looking at it in a waiting, second-counting, <lb/>
but deeply grateful kind of way. And the instant it <lb/>
closed they flung their arms about each other's necks, <lb/>
and there, heart to heart and lip to lip&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Oh, my God, she's kissing it!"</p>
<p>Nobody heard this remark, because Hawkins, who <lb/>
bred it, only thought it; he didn't utter it. He had <lb/>
turned the moment he had closed the door, and had <lb/>
pushed it open a little, intending to re-enter and ask <lb/>
what ill-advised thing he had done or said, and apolo- <lb/>
gize for it. But he didn't re-enter; he staggered off <lb/>
stunned, terrified, distressed.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Five</smcap> minutes later he was sitting in his room, with <lb/>
his head bowed within the circle of his arms, on <lb/>
the table&#x2014;final atttiude of grief and despair. His <lb/>
tears were flowing fast, and now and then a sob broke <lb/>
upon the stillness. Presently he said:</p>
<p>"I knew her when she was a little child and used to <lb/>
climb about my knees; I love her as I love my own, <lb/>
and now&#x2014;oh, poor thing, poor thing, I cannot bear <lb/>
it!&#x2014;she's gone and lost her heart to this mangy <lb/>
materializee! Why <i>didn't</i> we see that that might hap- <lb/>
pen? But how could we? Nobody could; nobody could <lb/>
ever have dreamed of such a thing. You couldn't ex- <lb/>
pect a person would fall in love with a wax-work. <lb/>
And this one doesn't even amount to that."</p>
<p>He went on grieving to himself, and now and then <lb/>
giving voice to his lamentations.</p>
<p>"It's done, oh, it's done, and there's no help for it, <lb/>
no undoing the miserable business. If I had the nerve, <lb/>
I would kill it. But that wouldn't do any good. <i>She</i> <lb/>
loves it; she thinks it's genuine and authentic. If she <lb/>
lost it she would grieve for it just as she would for a <lb/>
real person. And who's to break it to the family? <lb/>
Not I&#x2014;I'll die first. Sellers is the best human being <lb/>
I ever knew, and I wouldn't any more think of&#x2014;oh, <lb/>
dear, why it'll break his heart when he finds it out. <lb/>
And Polly's, too. <i>This</i> comes of meddling with such <lb/>
infernal matters! But for this the creature would still <lb/>
be roasting in Sheol, where it belongs. How is it that <lb/>
<pb n="189"/>
these people don't smell the brimstone? Sometimes I <lb/>
can't come into the same room with him without nearly <lb/>
suffocating."</p>
<p>After a while he broke out again:</p>
<p>"Well, there's <i>one</i> thing sure. The materializing <lb/>
has got to stop right where it is. If she's got to marry <lb/>
a specter, let her marry a decent one out of the Middle <lb/>
Ages, like this one&#x2014;not a cowboy and a thief such as <lb/>
this protoplasmic tadpole's going to turn into if Sellers <lb/>
keeps on fussing at it. It costs five thousand dollars <lb/>
cash and shuts down on the incorporated company to <lb/>
stop the works at this point, but Sally Sellers's happi- <lb/>
ness is worth more than that."</p>
<p>He heard Sellers coming, and got himself to rights. <lb/>
Sellers took a seat, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, I've got to confess I'm a good deal puzzled. <lb/>
It did certainly eat, there's no getting around it. Not <lb/>
eat, exactly, either, but it nibbled; nibbled in an ap- <lb/>
petiteless way, but still it nibbled; and that's just a <lb/>
marvel. Now the question is, What does it do with <lb/>
those nibblings? That's it&#x2014;what does it do with <lb/>
them? My idea is that we don't begin to know all <lb/>
there is to that stupendous discovery yet. But time <lb/>
will show&#x2014;time and science&#x2014;give us a chance, and <lb/>
don't get impatient."</p>
<p>But he couldn't get Hawkins interested; couldn't <lb/>
make him talk to amount to anything; couldn't drag <lb/>
him out of his depression. But at last he took a turn <lb/>
that arrested Hawkins's attention.</p>
<p>"I'm coming to like him, Hawkins. He is a person <lb/>
of stupendous character&#x2014;absolutely gigantic. Under <lb/>
that placid exterior is concealed the most dare-devil <lb/>
spirit that was ever put into a man; he's just a Clive <lb/>
over again. Yes, I'm all admiration for him on ac- <lb/>
count of his character, and liking naturally follows <lb/>
admiration, you know. I'm coming to like him im- <lb/>
<pb n="190"/>
mensely. Do you know, I haven't the heart to degrade <lb/>
such a character as that down to the burglar estate for <lb/>
money or for anything else; and I've come to ask if <lb/>
you are willing to let the reward go and leave this poor <lb/>
fellow&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Where he is?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;not bring him down to date."</p>
<p>"Oh, there's my hand; and my heart's in it, too!"</p>
<p>"I'll never forget you for this, Hawkins," said the <lb/>
old gentleman, in a voice which he found it hard to <lb/>
control. "You are making a great sacrifice for me, <lb/>
and one which you can ill afford, but I'll never forget <lb/>
your generosity, and if I live you shall not suffer for it, <lb/>
be sure of that."</p>
<p>Sally Sellers immediately and vividly realized that <lb/>
she was become a new being; a being of a far higher <lb/>
and worthier sort than she had been such a little while <lb/>
before; an earnest being, in place of a dreamer; and <lb/>
supplied with a reason for her presence in the world, <lb/>
where merely a wistful and troubled curiosity about it <lb/>
had existed before. So great and so comprehensive <lb/>
was the change which had been wrought that she <lb/>
seemed to herself to be a real person who had lately <lb/>
been a shadow; a something, which had lately been a <lb/>
nothing; a purpose, which had lately been a fancy; a <lb/>
finished temple, with the altar-fires lit and the voice of <lb/>
worship ascending, where before had been but an <lb/>
architect's confusion of arid working plans, unintelli- <lb/>
gible to the passing eye and prohesying nothing.</p>
<p>"Lady" Gwendolen! The pleasantness of that <lb/>
sound was all gone; it was an offense to her ear now. <lb/>
She said:</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;that sham belongs to the past; I will not <lb/>
be called by it any more."</p>
<p>"I may call you simply Gwendolen? You will allow <lb/>
<pb n="191"/>
me to drop the formalities straightway and name you <lb/>
by your dear first name without additions?"</p>
<p>She was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a <lb/>
rosebud.</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;that is better. I hate pinks&#x2014;some <lb/>
pinks. Indeed, yes, you are to call me by my first <lb/>
name without additions&#x2014;that is&#x2014;well, I don't mean <lb/>
without additions <i>entirely</i>, but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>It was as far as she could get. There was a pause; <lb/>
his intellect was struggling to comprehend; presently <lb/>
it did manage to catch the idea in time to save embar- <lb/>
rassment all around, and he said, gratefully:</p>
<p>"<i>Dear</i> Gwendolen! I may say that?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;part of it. But&#x2014;don't kiss me when I <lb/>
am talking; it makes me forget what I was going to <lb/>
say. You can call me by part of that form, but not <lb/>
the last part. Gwendolen is not my name."</p>
<p>"Not your name?" This in a tone of wonder and <lb/>
surprise.</p>
<p>The girl's soul was suddenly invaded by a creepy <lb/>
apprehension, a quite definite sense of suspicion and <lb/>
alarm. She put his arms away from her, looked <lb/>
searchingly in the eye, and said:</p>
<p>"Answer me truly, on your honor. You are not <lb/>
seeking to marry me on account of my <i>rank?</i>"</p>
<p>The shot almost knocked him through the wall, he <lb/>
was so little prepared for it. There was something so <lb/>
finely grotesque about the question and its parent sus- <lb/>
picion that he stopped to wonder and admire, and thus <lb/>
was he saved from laughing. Then, without wasting <lb/>
precious time, he set about the task of convincing her <lb/>
that he had been lured by herself alone, and had fallen <lb/>
in love with her only, not her title and position; that <lb/>
he loved her with all his heart, and could not love her <lb/>
more if she were a duchess, or less if she were without <lb/>
home, name, or family. She watched his face wist- <lb/>
<pb n="192"/>
fully, eagerly, hopefully, translating his words by its <lb/>
expression; and when he had finished there was glad- <lb/>
ness in her heart&#x2014;a tumultuous gladness, indeed, <lb/>
though outwardly she was calm, tranquil, even judicially <lb/>
austere. She prepared a surprise for him now, calcu- <lb/>
lated to put a heavy strain upon those disinterested <lb/>
protestations of his; and thus she delivered it, burning <lb/>
it away word by word as the fuse burns down to a <lb/>
bombshell, and watching to see how far the explosion <lb/>
would lift him.</p>
<p>"Listen&#x2014;and do not doubt me&#x2014;for I shall speak <lb/>
the exact truth. Howard Tracy, I am no more an <lb/>
earl's child than you are!"</p>
<p>To her joy&#x2014;and secret surprise also&#x2014;it never <lb/>
phased him. He was ready this time, and saw his <lb/>
chance. He cried out, with enthusiasm, "Thank <lb/>
Heaven for that!" and gathered her to his arms.</p>
<p>To express her happiness was almost beyond her <lb/>
gift of speech.</p>
<p>"You make me the proudest girl in all the earth," <lb/>
she said, with her head pillowed on his shoulder. "I <lb/>
thought it only natural that you should be dazzled by <lb/>
the title&#x2014;maybe even unconsciously, you being Eng- <lb/>
lish&#x2014;and that you might be deceiving yourself in <lb/>
thinking you loved only me, and find you didn't love <lb/>
me when the deception was swept away; so it makes <lb/>
me proud that the revelation stands for nothing and <lb/>
that you <i>do</i> love just me, only me&#x2014;oh, prouder than <lb/>
any words can tell!"</p>
<p>"It is only you, sweetheart; I never gave one envy- <lb/>
ing glance towards your father's earldom. That is <lb/>
utterly true, dear Gwendolen."</p>
<p>"There&#x2014;you mustn't call me that. I hate that <lb/>
false name. I told you it wasn't mine. My name is <lb/>
Sally Sellers or Sarah, if you like. From this time I <lb/>
banish dreams, visions, imaginings, and will no more <lb/>
<pb n="193"/>
of them. I am going to be myself <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> my genuine <lb/>
self, my honest self, my natural self, clear and clean of <lb/>
sham and folly and fraud, and worthy of you. There <lb/>
is no grain of social inequality between us; I, like you, <lb/>
am poor; I, like you, am without position or distinc- <lb/>
tion; you are a struggling artist; I am that, too, in my <lb/>
humbler way. Our bread is honest bread; we work <lb/>
for our living. Hand in hand we will walk hence to <lb/>
the grave, helping each other in all ways, living for <lb/>
each other, being and remaining one in heart and pur- <lb/>
pose, one in hope and aspiration, inseparable to the <lb/>
end. And though our place is low, judged by the <lb/>
world's eye, we will make it as high as the highest in <lb/>
the great essentials of honest work for what we eat and <lb/>
wear, and conduct above reproach. We live in a land, <lb/>
let us be thankful, where this is all-sufficient, and no <lb/>
man is better than his neighbor by the grace of God, <lb/>
but only by his own merit."</p>
<p>Tracy tried to break in, but she stopped him, and <lb/>
kept the floor herself.</p>
<p>"I am not through yet. I am going to purge <lb/>
myself of the last vestiges of artificiality and pretence, <lb/>
and then start fair on your own honest level, and be <lb/>
worthy mate to you thenceforth. My father honestly <lb/>
thinks he is an earl. Well, leave him his dream; it <lb/>
pleases him, and does no one any harm. It was the <lb/>
dream of his ancestors before him. It has made fools <lb/>
of the house of Sellers for generations, and it made <lb/>
something of a fool of me, but took no deep root. I <lb/>
am done with it now, and for good. Forty-eight hours <lb/>
ago I was privately proud of being the daughter of a <lb/>
pinchbeck earl, and thought the proper mate for me <lb/>
must be a man of like degree; but to-day&#x2014;oh, how <lb/>
grateful I am for your love, which has healed my sick <lb/>
brain and restored my sanity!&#x2014;I could make oath <lb/>
that no earl's son in all the world&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="194"/>
<p>"Oh&#x2014;well, but&#x2014;but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, you look like a person in a panic. What is <lb/>
it? What is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Matter? Oh, nothing&#x2014;nothing. I was only <lb/>
going to say"&#x2014;but in his flurry nothing occurred to <lb/>
him to say for a moment; then by a lucky inspiration <lb/>
he thought of something entirely sufficient for the occa- <lb/>
sion, and brought it out with eloquent force: "Oh, <lb/>
how beautiful you are! You take my breath away <lb/>
when you look like that."</p>
<p>It was well conceived, well timed, and cordially de- <lb/>
livered&#x2014;and it got its reward.</p>
<p>"Let me see. Where was I? Yes, my father's <lb/>
earldom is pure moonshine. Look at those dreadful <lb/>
things on the wall. You have of course supposed <lb/>
them to be portraits of his ancestors, earls of Ross- <lb/>
more. Well, they are not. They are chromos of <lb/>
distinguished Americans&#x2014;all moderns; but he has <lb/>
carried them back a thousand years by relabeling <lb/>
them. Andrew Jackson there is doing what he can to <lb/>
be the late American earl; and the newest treasure in <lb/>
the collection is supposed to be the young English heir <lb/>
&#x2014;I mean the idiot with the crape; but in truth it's a <lb/>
shoemaker, and not Lord Berkeley at all."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course I am. He wouldn't look like that."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because his conduct in his last moments, when the <lb/>
fire was sweeping around him, shows that he was a <lb/>
man. It shows that he was a fine, high-souled young <lb/>
creature."</p>
<p>Tracy was strongly moved by these compliments, <lb/>
and it seemed to him that the girl's lovely lips took on <lb/>
a new loveliness when they were delivering them. He <lb/>
said, softly:</p>
<p>"It is a pity he could not know what a gracious <lb/>
<pb n="195"/>
impression his behavior was going to leave with the <lb/>
dearest and sweetest stranger in the land of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I almost loved him! Why, I think of him <lb/>
every day. He is always floating about in my mind."</p>
<p>Tracy felt that this was a little more than was neces- <lb/>
sary. He was conscious of the sting of jealousy. He <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"It is quite right to think of him&#x2014;at least, now <lb/>
and then&#x2014;that is, at intervals&#x2014;in perhaps an admir- <lb/>
ing way&#x2014;but it seems to me that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Howard Tracy, are you jealous of that dead man?"</p>
<p>He was ashamed&#x2014;and at the same time not <lb/>
ashamed. He was jealous&#x2014;and at the same time he <lb/>
was not jealous. In a sense the dead man was him- <lb/>
self; in that case compliments and affection lavished <lb/>
upon that corpse went into his own till and were clear <lb/>
profit. But in another sense the dead man was not <lb/>
himself; and in that case all compliments and affection <lb/>
lavished there were wasted, and a sufficient basis for <lb/>
jealousy. A tiff was the result of the dispute between <lb/>
the two. Then they made it up, and were more loving <lb/>
than ever. As an affectionate clincher of the recon- <lb/>
ciliation, Sally declared that she had now banished <lb/>
Lord Berkeley from her mind; and added, "And in <lb/>
order to make sure that he shall never make trouble <lb/>
between us again, I will teach myself to detest that <lb/>
name and all that have ever borne it or ever shall bear <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>This inflicted another pang, and Tracy was minded <lb/>
to ask her to modify that a little&#x2014;just on general <lb/>
principles, and as practice in not overdoing a good <lb/>
thing&#x2014;perhaps he might better leave things as they <lb/>
were and not risk bringing on another tiff. He got <lb/>
away from that particular, and sought less tender <lb/>
ground for conversation.</p>
<p>"I suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies <lb/>
<pb n="196"/>
and nobilities, now that you have renounced your title <lb/>
and your father's earldom?"</p>
<p>"<i>Real</i> ones? Oh, dear no; but I've thrown aside <lb/>
our sham one for good."</p>
<p>This answer fell just at the right time and just in the <lb/>
right place to save the poor, unstable young man from <lb/>
changing his political complexion once more. He had <lb/>
been on the point of beginning to totter again, but this <lb/>
prop shored him up and kept him from floundering <lb/>
back into democracy and re-renouncing aristocracy. <lb/>
So he went home glad that he had asked the fortunate <lb/>
question. The girl would accept a little thing like a <lb/>
genuine earldom; she was merely prejudiced against <lb/>
the brummagem article. Yes, he could have his girl <lb/>
and have his earldom, too; that question was a fortu- <lb/>
nate stroke.</p>
<p>Sally went to bed happy, too; and remained happy, <lb/>
deliriously happy, for nearly two hours; but at last, <lb/>
just as she was sinking into a contented and luxurious <lb/>
unconsciousness, the shady devil who lives and lurks <lb/>
and hides and watches inside of human beings and is <lb/>
always waiting for a chance to do the proprietor a <lb/>
malicious damage, whispered to her soul and said, <lb/>
"That question had a harmless look, but what was <lb/>
<i>back</i> of it?&#x2014;what was the secret motive of it?&#x2014;what <lb/>
suggested it?"</p>
<p>The shady devil had knifed her, and could retire <lb/>
now and take a rest; the wound would attend to busi- <lb/>
ness for him. And it did.</p>
<p><i>Why</i> should Howard Tracy ask that question? If <lb/>
he was not trying to marry her for the sake of her <lb/>
rank, what should suggest that question to him? <lb/>
Didn't he plainly look gratified when she said her ob- <lb/>
jections to aristocracy had their limitations? Ah, he is <lb/>
after that earldom, that gilded sham&#x2014;it isn't poor me <lb/>
he wants.</p>
<pb n="197"/>
<p>So she argued, in anguish and tears. Then she <lb/>
argued the opposite theory, but made a weak, poor <lb/>
business of it, and lost the case. She kept the arguing <lb/>
up, one side and then the other, the rest of the night, <lb/>
and at last fell asleep at dawn; fell in the fire at dawn, <lb/>
one may say; for that kind of sleep resembles fire, <lb/>
and one comes out of it with his brain baked and his <lb/>
physical forces fried out of him.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXIII.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Tracy</smcap> wrote his father before he sought his bed. <lb/>
He wrote a letter which he believed would get <lb/>
better treatment than his cablegram received, for it <lb/>
contained what ought to be welcome news: namely, <lb/>
that he had tried equality and working for a living; <lb/>
had made a fight which he could find no reason to be <lb/>
ashamed of, and in the matter of earning a living had <lb/>
proved that he was able to do it; but that on the whole <lb/>
he had arrived at the conclusion that he could not re- <lb/>
form the world single-handed, and was willing to retire <lb/>
from the conflict with the fair degree of honor which <lb/>
he had gained, and was also willing to return home and <lb/>
resume his position and be content with it and thankful <lb/>
for it for the future, leaving further experiment of a <lb/>
missionary sort to other young people needing the <lb/>
chastening and quelling persuasions of experience, the <lb/>
only logic sure to convince a diseased imagination and <lb/>
restore it to rugged health. Then he approached the <lb/>
subject of marriage with the daughter of the American <lb/>
Claimant with a good deal of caution and much pains- <lb/>
taking art. He said praiseful and appreciative things <lb/>
about the girl, but didn't dwell upon that detail or <lb/>
make it prominent. The thing which he made promi- <lb/>
nent was the opportunity now so happily afforded to <lb/>
reconcile York and Lancaster, graft the warring roses <lb/>
upon one stem, and end forever a crying injustice <lb/>
which had already lasted far too long. One could <lb/>
<pb n="199"/>
infer that he had thought this thing all out and chosen <lb/>
this way of making all things fair and right because it <lb/>
was sufficiently fair and considerably wiser than the <lb/>
renunciation scheme which he had brought with him <lb/>
from England. One could infer that, but he didn't <lb/>
say it. In fact, the more he read his letter over, the <lb/>
more he got to inferring it himself.</p>
<p>When the old earl received that letter the first part <lb/>
of it filled him with a grim and snarly satisfaction; but <lb/>
the rest of it brought a snort or two out of him that <lb/>
could be translated differently. He wasted no ink in <lb/>
this emergency, either in cablegrams or letters; he <lb/>
promptly took ship for America to look into the matter <lb/>
himself. He had stanchly held his grip all this long <lb/>
time, and given no sign of the hunger at his heart to <lb/>
see his son, hoping for the cure of his insane dream, <lb/>
and resolute that the process should go through all the <lb/>
necessary stages without assuaging telegrams or other <lb/>
nonsense from home, and here was victory at last&#x2014; <lb/>
victory, but stupidly marred by this idiotic marriage <lb/>
project. Yes, he would step over and take a hand in <lb/>
this matter himself.</p>
<p>During the first ten days following the mailing of the <lb/>
letter Tracy's spirits had no idle time; they were <lb/>
always climbing up into the clouds or sliding down <lb/>
into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation reached. <lb/>
He was intensely happy or intensely miserable by <lb/>
turns, according to Miss Sally's moods. He never <lb/>
could tell when the mood was going to change, and <lb/>
when it changed he couldn't tell what it was that had <lb/>
changed it. Sometimes she was so in love with him <lb/>
that her love was tropical, torrid, and she could find <lb/>
no language fervent enough for its expression; then <lb/>
suddenly, and without warning or any apparent reason, <lb/>
the weather would change, and the victim would find <lb/>
himself adrift among the icebergs and feeling as lone- <lb/>
<pb n="200"/>
some and friendless as the north pole. It sometimes <lb/>
seemed to him that a man might better be dead than <lb/>
exposed to these devastating varieties of climate.</p>
<p>The case was simple. Sally <i>wanted</i> to believe that <lb/>
Tracy's preference was disinterested; so she was always <lb/>
applying little tests of one sort or another, hoping and <lb/>
expecting that they would bring out evidence which <lb/>
would confirm or fortify her belief. Poor Tracy did <lb/>
not know that these experiments were being made <lb/>
upon him, consequently he walked promptly into all <lb/>
the traps the girl set for him. These traps consisted <lb/>
in apparently casual references to social distinction, <lb/>
aristocratic title and privilege, and such things. Often <lb/>
Tracy responded to these references heedlessly and not <lb/>
much caring what he said, provided it kept the talk <lb/>
going and prolonged the s&#x00E9;ance. He didn't suspect <lb/>
that the girl was watching his face and listening for his <lb/>
words as one who watches the judge's face and listens <lb/>
for the words which will restore him to home and <lb/>
friends and freedom, or shut him away from the sun <lb/>
and human companionship forever. He didn't suspect <lb/>
that his careless words were being weighed, and so he <lb/>
often delivered sentence of death when it would have <lb/>
been just as handy and all the same to him to pro- <lb/>
nounce acquittal. Daily he broke the girl's heart, <lb/>
nightly he sent her to the rack for sleep. He couldn't <lb/>
understand it.</p>
<p>Some people would have put this and that together <lb/>
and perceived that the weather never changed until one <lb/>
particular subject was introduced, and that then it <lb/>
<i>always</i> changed. And they would have looked further, <lb/>
and perceived that that subject was always introduced <lb/>
by the one party, never the other. They would have <lb/>
argued then that this was done for a purpose. If they <lb/>
could not find out what that purpose was in any simpler <lb/>
or easier way they would <i>ask</i>.</p>
<pb n="201"/>
<p>But Tracy was not deep enough or suspicious enough <lb/>
to think of these things. He noticed only one particu- <lb/>
lar: that the weather was always sunny when a visit <lb/>
<i>began</i>. No matter how much it might cloud up later, <lb/>
it always began with a clear sky. He couldn't explain <lb/>
this curious fact to himself; he merely knew it to be a <lb/>
fact. The truth of the matter was that by the time <lb/>
Tracy had been out of Sally's sight six hours she was <lb/>
so famishing for a sight of him that her doubts and <lb/>
suspicions were all consumed away in the fire of that <lb/>
longing, and so always she came into his presence as <lb/>
surprisingly radiant and joyous as she wasn't when she <lb/>
went out of it.</p>
<p>In circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a <lb/>
good many risks. The portrait of Sellers, by Tracy, <lb/>
was fighting along day by day through this mixed <lb/>
weather, and daily adding to itself ineradicable signs of <lb/>
the checkered life it was leading. It was the happiest <lb/>
portrait, in spots, that was ever seen; but in other <lb/>
spots a damned soul looked out from it; a soul that <lb/>
was suffering all the different kinds of distress there <lb/>
are, from stomachache to rabies. But Sellers liked it. <lb/>
He said it was just himself all over&#x2014;a portrait that <lb/>
sweated moods from every pore, and no two moods <lb/>
alike. He said he had as many different kinds of <lb/>
emotions in him as a jug.</p>
<p>It was a kind of a deadly work of art, maybe, but it <lb/>
was a starchy picture for show; for it was life-size, full <lb/>
length, and represented the American earl in a peer's <lb/>
scarlet robe, with the three ermine bars indicative of an <lb/>
earl's rank, and on the gray head an earl's coronet <lb/>
tilted just a wee bit to one side in a most gallus and <lb/>
winsome way. When Sally's weather was sunny the <lb/>
portrait made Tracy chuckle, but when her weather <lb/>
was overcast it disordered his mind and stopped the <lb/>
circulation of his blood.</p>
<pb n="202"/>
<p>Late one night when the sweethearts had been having <lb/>
a flawless visit together, Sally's interior devil began to <lb/>
work his specialty, and soon the conversation was <lb/>
drifting towards the customary rock. Presently, in the <lb/>
midst of Tracy's serene flow of talk, he felt a shudder <lb/>
which he knew was not his shudder, but exterior to his <lb/>
breast although immediately against it. After the <lb/>
shudder came sobs: Sally was crying.</p>
<p>"Oh, my darling, what have I done&#x2014;what have I <lb/>
said? It has happened again! What <i>have</i> I done to <lb/>
wound you?"</p>
<p>She disengaged herself from his arms and gave him <lb/>
a look of deep reproach.</p>
<p>"What have you done? I will tell you what you <lb/>
have done. You have unwittingly revealed&#x2014;oh, for <lb/>
the twentieth time, though I <i>could</i> not believe it, <i>would</i> <lb/>
not believe it!&#x2014;that it is not me you love, but that <lb/>
foolish sham, my father's imitation earldom; and you <lb/>
have broken my heart!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my child, what are you saying? I never <lb/>
dreamed of such a thing!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Howard! Howard! the things you have ut- <lb/>
tered when you were forgetting to guard your tongue <lb/>
have betrayed you!"</p>
<p>"Things I have uttered when I was <i>forgetting</i> to <lb/>
guard my tongue? These are hard words. When <lb/>
have I <i>remembered</i> to guard it? Never in one instance. <lb/>
It has no office but to speak the truth. It needs no <lb/>
guarding for that."</p>
<p>"Howard, I have noted your words and weighed <lb/>
them when you were not thinking of their significance <lb/>
&#x2014;and they have told me more than you meant they <lb/>
should."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say you have answered the trust <lb/>
I had in you by using it as an ambuscade from which <lb/>
you could set snares for my unsuspecting tongue and <lb/>
<pb n="203"/>
be safe from detection while you did it? You have <lb/>
not done this&#x2014;surely you have not done this thing. <lb/>
Oh, one's enemy could not do it!"</p>
<p>This was an aspect of the girl's conduct which she <lb/>
had not clearly perceived before. Was it treachery? <lb/>
Had she abused a trust? The thought crimsoned her <lb/>
cheeks with shame and remorse.</p>
<p>"Oh, forgive me," she said; "I did not know <lb/>
what I was doing. I have been so tortured&#x2014;you <i>will</i> <lb/>
forgive me, you <i>must;</i> I have suffered so much, and I <lb/>
am so sorry and so humble; you <i>do</i> forgive me, <i>don't</i> <lb/>
you? Don't turn away, don't refuse me; it is only <lb/>
my love that is at fault, and you <i>know</i> I love you&#x2014; <lb/>
love you with all my heart; I couldn't bear to&#x2014;oh, <lb/>
dear, dear, I am so miserable, and I <i>never</i> meant any <lb/>
harm, and I didn't see where this insanity was carrying <lb/>
me, and how it was wronging and abusing the dearest <lb/>
heart in all the world to me&#x2014;and&#x2014;and&#x2014;oh, take <lb/>
me in your arms again; I have no other refuge, no <lb/>
other home and hope!"</p>
<p>There was reconciliation again&#x2014;immediate, perfect, <lb/>
all-embracing&#x2014;and with it utter happiness. This <lb/>
would have been a good time to adjourn. But no, <lb/>
now that the cloud-breeder was revealed at last; now <lb/>
that it was manifest that all the sour weather had come <lb/>
from this girl's dread that Tracy was lured by her rank <lb/>
and not herself, he resolved to lay that ghost imme- <lb/>
diately and permanently by furnishing the best possible <lb/>
proof that he <i>couldn't</i> have had back of him at any <lb/>
time the suspected motive. So he said:</p>
<p>"Let me whisper a little secret in your ear&#x2014;a <lb/>
secret which I have kept shut up in my breast all this <lb/>
time. Your rank <i>couldn't</i> ever have been an entice- <lb/>
ment. I am son and heir to an English earl!"</p>
<p>The girl stared at him&#x2014;one, two, three moments, <lb/>
maybe a dozen&#x2014;then her lips parted.</p>
<pb n="204"/>
<p>"You?" she said, and moved away from him, still <lb/>
gazing at him in a kind of blank amazement.</p>
<p>"Why&#x2014;why, certainly I am. Why do you act <lb/>
like this? What have I done <i>now?</i>"</p>
<p>"What have you done? You have certainly made a <lb/>
most strange statement. You must see that yourself."</p>
<p>"Well," with a timid little laugh, "it may be a <lb/>
strange enough statement; but of what consequence is <lb/>
that if it is true?"</p>
<p>"<i>If</i> it is true. You are already retiring from it."</p>
<p>"Oh, not for a moment! You should not say that. <lb/>
I have not deserved it. I have spoken the truth; why <lb/>
do you doubt it?"</p>
<p>Her reply was prompt.</p>
<p>"Simply because you didn't speak it earlier."</p>
<p>"Oh!" It wasn't a groan exactly, but it was an <lb/>
intelligible enough expression of the fact that he saw <lb/>
the point and recognized that there was reason in it.</p>
<p>"You have seemed to conceal nothing from me that <lb/>
I ought to know concerning yourself, and you were not <lb/>
privileged to keep back such a thing as this from me a <lb/>
moment after&#x2014;after&#x2014;well, after you had determined <lb/>
to pay your court to me."</p>
<p>"It's true, it's true, I know it! But there were <lb/>
circumstances&#x2014;in&#x2014;in the way&#x2014;circumstances <lb/>
which&#x2014;"</p>
<p>She waived the circumstances aside.</p>
<p>"Well, you see," he said, pleadingly, "you seemed <lb/>
so bent on our traveling the proud path of honest labor <lb/>
and honorable poverty that I was terrified&#x2014;that is, I <lb/>
was afraid&#x2014;of&#x2014;of&#x2014;well, <i>you</i> know how you <lb/>
talked."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know how I talked. And I also know that <lb/>
before the talk was finished you inquired how I stood <lb/>
as regards aristocracies, and my answer was calculated <lb/>
to relieve your fears."</p>
<pb n="205"/>
<p>He was silent a while. Then he said, in a discour- <lb/>
aged way:</p>
<p>"I don't see any way out of it. It was a mistake. <lb/>
That is in truth all it was, just a mistake. No harm <lb/>
was meant, no harm in the world. I didn't see how it <lb/>
might some time look. It is my way. I don't seem <lb/>
to see far."</p>
<p>The girl was almost disarmed for a moment. Then <lb/>
she flared up again.</p>
<p>"An earl's son! Do earls' sons go about working <lb/>
in lowly callings for their bread and butter?"</p>
<p>"God knows they don't! I have wished they did."</p>
<p>"Do earls' sons sink their degree in a country like <lb/>
this, and come sober and decent to sue for the hand of <lb/>
a born child of poverty when they can go drunk, pro- <lb/>
fane, and steeped in dishonorable debt and buy the <lb/>
pick and choice of the millionaires' daughters of <lb/>
America? <i>You</i> an earl's son! Show me the signs."</p>
<p>"I thank God I am not able&#x2014;if those are the <lb/>
signs. But yet I am an earl's son and heir. It is all <lb/>
I can say. I wish you would believe me, but you will <lb/>
not. I know no way to persuade you."</p>
<p>She was about to soften again, but his closing re- <lb/>
mark made her bring her foot down with smart vexa- <lb/>
tion, and she cried out:</p>
<p>"Oh, you drive all patience out of me! Would <lb/>
you have one believe that you haven't your proofs at <lb/>
hand, and yet are what you say you are? You do <lb/>
not put your hand in your pocket <i>now</i>&#x2014;for you have <lb/>
nothing there. You make a claim like this, and then <lb/>
venture to travel without credentials. These are simply <lb/>
incredibilities. Don't you see that yourself?"</p>
<p>He cast about in his mind for a defense of some <lb/>
kind or other&#x2014;hesitated a little, and then said, with <lb/>
difficulty and diffidence:</p>
<p>"I will tell you just the truth, foolish as it will seem <lb/>
<pb n="206"/>
to you&#x2014;to anybody, I suppose&#x2014;but it <i>is</i> the truth. <lb/>
I had an ideal&#x2014;call it a dream, a folly, if you will&#x2014; <lb/>
but I wanted to renounce the privileges and unfair ad- <lb/>
vantages enjoyed by the nobility and wrung from the <lb/>
nation by force and fraud, and purge myself of my <lb/>
share of those crimes against right and reason by <lb/>
thenceforth comrading with the poor and humble on <lb/>
equal terms, earning with my own hands the bread I <lb/>
ate, and rising by my own merit if I rose at all."</p>
<p>The young girl scanned his face narrowly while he <lb/>
spoke; and there was something about his simplicity <lb/>
of manner and statement which touched her&#x2014;touched <lb/>
her almost to the danger point; but she set her grip <lb/>
on the yielding spirit and choked it to quiescence; it <lb/>
could not be wise to surrender to compassion or any <lb/>
kind of sentiment yet; she must ask one or two more <lb/>
questions. Tracy was reading her face; and what he <lb/>
read there lifted his drooping hopes a little.</p>
<p>"An earl's son to do that! Why, he were a man! <lb/>
A man to love!&#x2014;oh, more, a man to worship!"</p>
<p>"Why, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But he never lived! He is not born, he will not <lb/>
be born. The self-abnegation that could do that&#x2014; <lb/>
even in utter folly, and hopeless of conveying benefit <lb/>
to any, beyond the mere example&#x2014;could be mistaken <lb/>
for greatness; why, it would <i>be</i> greatness in this cold <lb/>
age of sordid ideals! A moment&#x2014;wait&#x2014;let me <lb/>
finish; I have one question more. Your father is earl <lb/>
of what?"</p>
<p>"Rossmore&#x2014;and I am Viscount Berkeley."</p>
<p>The fat was in the fire again. The girl felt so out- <lb/>
raged that it was difficult for her to speak.</p>
<p>"How <i>can</i> you venture such a brazen thing! You <lb/>
know that he is dead, and you know that I know it. <lb/>
Oh, to rob the living of name and honors for a selfish <lb/>
and temporary advantage is crime enough, but to rob <lb/>
<pb n="207"/>
the defenceless dead&#x2014;why, it is more than crime: it <lb/>
<i>degrades</i> crime!"</p>
<p>"Oh, listen to me&#x2014;just a word&#x2014;don't turn away <lb/>
like that. Don't go&#x2014;don't leave me so&#x2014;stay one <lb/>
moment. On my honor&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, on your honor!"</p>
<p>"On my honor I am what I say! And I will prove <lb/>
it, and you will believe, I know you will. I will bring <lb/>
you a message&#x2014;a cablegram&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"To-morrow&#x2014;next day&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Signed 'Rossmore'?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;signed Rossmore."</p>
<p>"What will that prove?"</p>
<p>"What will it prove? What <i>should</i> it prove?"</p>
<p>"If you force me to say it&#x2014;possibly the presence <lb/>
of a confederate somewhere."</p>
<p>This was a hard blow, and staggered him. He said, <lb/>
dejectedly:</p>
<p>"It is true. I did not think of it. Oh, my God, I <lb/>
do not know any way to do; I do everything wrong. <lb/>
You are going?&#x2014;and you won't say even good night <lb/>
&#x2014;or good-bye? Ah, we have not parted like this <lb/>
before."</p>
<p>"Oh, I <i>want</i> to run and&#x2014;no, go now." A pause <lb/>
&#x2014;then she said, "You may bring the message when <lb/>
it comes."</p>
<p>"Oh, may I? God bless you."</p>
<p>He was gone; and none too soon; her lips were <lb/>
already quivering, and now she broke down. Through <lb/>
her sobbings her words broke from time to time.</p>
<p>"Oh, he is gone. I have lost him, I shall never see <lb/>
him any more. And he didn't kiss me good-bye; <lb/>
never even offered to force a kiss from me, and he <lb/>
<i>knowing</i> it was the very, very last, and I expecting he <lb/>
would, and never <i>dreaming</i> he would treat me so after <lb/>
<pb n="208"/>
all we have been to each other. Oh, oh, oh, oh, what <lb/>
shall I do, what <i>shall</i> I do? He is a dear, poor, <lb/>
miserable, good-hearted, transparent liar and humbug, <lb/>
but oh, I <i>do</i> love him so!" After a little she broke <lb/>
into speech again. "How dear he is! and I shall <lb/>
miss him so, I shall miss him so! Why <i>won't</i> he ever <lb/>
think to <i>forge</i> a message and fetch it?&#x2014;but no, he <lb/>
never will, he never thinks of anything; he's so honest <lb/>
and simple it wouldn't ever occur to him. Oh, what <lb/>
<i>did</i> possess him to think he could succeed as a fraud&#x2014; <lb/>
and he hasn't the first requisite except duplicity that I <lb/>
can see. Oh, dear, I'll go to bed and give it all up. <lb/>
Oh, I <i>wish</i> I had told him to come and tell me when- <lb/>
ever he didn't get any telegram&#x2014;and now it's all my <lb/>
own fault if I never see him again. How my eyes <lb/>
must look!"</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXIV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Next</smcap> day, sure enough, the cablegram didn't come. <lb/>
This was an immense disaster; for Tracy couldn't <lb/>
go into the presence without that ticket, although it <lb/>
wasn't going to possess any value as evidence. But if <lb/>
the failure of the cablegram on that first day may be <lb/>
called an immense disaster, where is the dictionary that <lb/>
can turn out a phrase sizeable enough to describe the <lb/>
tenth day's failure? Of course every day that the <lb/>
cablegram didn't come made Tracy all of twenty-four <lb/>
hours more ashamed of himself than he was the day <lb/>
before, and made Sally fully twenty-four hours more <lb/>
certain than ever that he not only hadn't any father <lb/>
anywhere, but hadn't even a confederate&#x2014;and so it <lb/>
followed that he was a double-dyed humbug, and <lb/>
couldn't be otherwise.</p>
<p>These were hard days for Barrow and the art firm. <lb/>
All these had their hands full trying to comfort Tracy. <lb/>
Barrow's task was particularly hard, because he was <lb/>
made a confidant in full, and therefore had to humor <lb/>
Tracy's delusion that he had a father, and that the <lb/>
father was an earl, and that he was going to send a <lb/>
cablegram. Barrow early gave up the idea of trying <lb/>
to convince Tracy that he hadn't any father, because <lb/>
this had such a bad effect on the patient, and worked <lb/>
up his temper to such an alarming degree. He had <lb/>
tried, as an experiment, letting Tracy think he had a <lb/>
father; the result was so good that he went further, <lb/>
<pb n="210"/>
with proper caution, and tried letting him think his <lb/>
father was an earl; this wrought so well that he grew <lb/>
bold, and tried letting him think he had two fathers, if <lb/>
he wanted to, but he didn't want to, so Barrow with- <lb/>
drew one of them and substituted letting him think he <lb/>
was going to get a cablegram&#x2014;which Barrow judged <lb/>
he wouldn't, and was right; but Barrow worked the <lb/>
cablegram daily for all it was worth, and it was the one <lb/>
thing that kept Tracy alive; that was Barrow's opinion.</p>
<p>And these were bitter, hard days for poor Sally, and <lb/>
mainly delivered up to private crying. She kept her <lb/>
furniture pretty damp, and so caught cold, and the <lb/>
dampness and the cold and the sorrow together under- <lb/>
mined her appetite, and she was a pitiful enough ob- <lb/>
ject, poor thing! Her state was bad enough, as per <lb/>
statement of it above quoted; but all the forces of <lb/>
nature and circumstance seemed conspiring to make it <lb/>
worse&#x2014;and succeeding. For instance, the morning <lb/>
after her dismissal of Tracy, Hawkins and Sellers read <lb/>
in the associated press dispatches that a toy puzzle <lb/>
called Pigs in the Clover had come into sudden favor <lb/>
within the past few weeks, and that from the Atlantic <lb/>
to the Pacific all the populations of all the States had <lb/>
knocked off work to play with it, and that the business <lb/>
of the country had now come to a standstill by conse- <lb/>
quence; that judges, lawyers, burglars, parsons, <lb/>
thieves, merchants, mechanics, murderers, women, <lb/>
children, babies&#x2014;everybody, indeed, could be seen <lb/>
from morning till midnight absorbed in one deep pro- <lb/>
ject and purpose, and only one: to pen those pigs, <lb/>
work out that puzzle successfully; that all gayety, all <lb/>
cheerfulness, had departed from the nation, and in its <lb/>
place care, preoccupation, and anxiety sat upon every <lb/>
countenance, and all faces were drawn, distressed, and <lb/>
furrowed with the signs of age and trouble, and marked <lb/>
with the still sadder signs of mental decay and incipient <lb/>
<pb n="211"/>
madness; that factories were at work night and day in <lb/>
eight cities, and yet to supply the demand for the <lb/>
puzzle was thus far impossible. Hawkins was wild <lb/>
with joy, but Sellers was calm. Small matters could <lb/>
not disturb his serenity. He said:</p>
<p>"That's just the way things go. A man invents a <lb/>
thing which could revolutionize the arts, produce <lb/>
mountains of money, and bless the earth, and who <lb/>
will bother with it or show any interest in it?&#x2014;and <lb/>
so you are just as poor as you were before. But you <lb/>
invent some worthless thing to amuse yourself with, <lb/>
and would throw it away if let alone, and all of a <lb/>
sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out <lb/>
crops a fortune. Hunt up that Yankee and collect, <lb/>
Hawkins&#x2014;half is yours, you know. Leave me to <lb/>
potter at my lecture."</p>
<p>This was a temperance lecture. Sellers was head <lb/>
chief in the Temperance camp, and had lectured, now <lb/>
and then, in that interest, but had been dissatisfied <lb/>
with his efforts; wherefore he was now about to try a <lb/>
new plan. After much thought he had concluded that <lb/>
a main reason why his lectures lacked fire or some- <lb/>
thing was that they were too transparently amateurish; <lb/>
that is to say, it was probably too plainly perceptible <lb/>
that the lecturer was trying to tell people about the <lb/>
horrid effects of liquor when he didn't really know <lb/>
anything about those effects except from hearsay, since <lb/>
he had hardly ever tasted an intoxicant in his life. <lb/>
His scheme now was to prepare himself to speak from <lb/>
bitter experience. Hawkins was to stand by with the <lb/>
bottle, calculate the doses, watch the effects, make <lb/>
notes of results, and otherwise assist in the prepara- <lb/>
tion. Time was short, for the ladies would be along <lb/>
about noon&#x2014;that is to say, the temperance organiza- <lb/>
tion called the Daughters of Siloam&#x2014;and Sellers <lb/>
must be ready to head the procession.</p>
<pb n="212"/>
<p>The time kept slipping along&#x2014;Hawkins did not <lb/>
return&#x2014;Sellers could not venture to wait longer; so <lb/>
he attacked the bottle himself, and proceeded to note <lb/>
the effects. Hawkins got back at last; took one com- <lb/>
prehensive glance at the lecturer, and went down and <lb/>
headed off the procession. The ladies were grieved to <lb/>
hear that the champion had been taken suddenly ill <lb/>
and violently so, but glad to hear that it was hoped he <lb/>
would be out again in a few days.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the old gentleman didn't turn over <lb/>
or show any signs of life worth speaking of for twenty- <lb/>
four hours. Then he asked after the procession, and <lb/>
learned what had happened about it. He was sorry; <lb/>
said he had been "fixed" for it. He remained abed <lb/>
several days, and his wife and daughter took turns in <lb/>
sitting with him and ministering to his wants. Often <lb/>
he patted Sally's head and tried to comfort her.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, my child, don't cry so; <i>you</i> know your <lb/>
old father did it by mistake, and didn't mean a bit of <lb/>
harm; you know he wouldn't intentionally do any- <lb/>
thing to make you ashamed for the world; you know <lb/>
he was trying to do good, and only made the mistake <lb/>
through ignorance, not knowing the right doses and <lb/>
Washington not there to help. Don't cry so, dear, it <lb/>
breaks my old heart to see you, and think I've brought <lb/>
this humiliation on you, and you so dear to me and so <lb/>
good. I won't ever do it again, indeed I won't; now <lb/>
be comforted, honey, that's a good child."</p>
<p>But when she wasn't on duty at the bedside the cry- <lb/>
ing went on just the same; then the mother would try <lb/>
to comfort her, and say:</p>
<p>"Don't cry, dear, <i>he</i> never meant any harm; it was <lb/>
all one of those happens that you can't guard against <lb/>
when you are trying experiments that way. You see, <lb/>
<i>I</i> don't cry. It's because I know him so well. I <lb/>
could never look anybody in the face again if he had <lb/>
<pb n="213"/>
got into such an amazing condition as that a-purpose; <lb/>
but, bless you, his intention was pure and high, and <lb/>
that makes the <i>act</i> pure, though it was higher than was <lb/>
necessary. We're not humiliated, dear; he did it <lb/>
under a noble impulse, and we don't need to be <lb/>
ashamed. There, don't cry any more, honey."</p>
<p>Thus the old gentleman was useful to Sally during <lb/>
several days as an explanation of her tearfulness. She <lb/>
felt thankful to him for the shelter he was affording <lb/>
her, but often said to herself, "It's a shame to let him <lb/>
see in my crying a reproach&#x2014;as if he could ever do <lb/>
anything that could make me reproach him! But I <lb/>
can't confess; I've got to go on using him for a pre- <lb/>
text; he's the only one I've got in the world, and I do <lb/>
need one so much."</p>
<p>As soon as Sellers was out again, and found that <lb/>
stacks of money had been placed in bank for him and <lb/>
Hawkins by the Yankee, he said, "<i>Now</i> we'll soon <lb/>
see who's the Claimant and who's the Authentic. I'll <lb/>
just go over there and warm up that House of Lords." <lb/>
During the next few days he and his wife were so <lb/>
busy with preparations for the voyage that Sally had <lb/>
all the privacy she needed, and all the chance to cry <lb/>
that was good for her. Then the old pair left for New <lb/>
York&#x2014;and England.</p>
<p>Sally had also had a chance to do another thing. <lb/>
That was, to make up her mind that life was not worth <lb/>
living upon the present terms. If she <i>must</i> give up <lb/>
her impostor and die, doubtless she must submit; but <lb/>
might she not lay her whole case before some disinter- <lb/>
ested person first, and see if there wasn't perhaps some <lb/>
saving way out of the matter? She turned this idea <lb/>
over in her mind a good deal. In her first visit with <lb/>
Hawkins after her parents were gone, the talk fell <lb/>
upon Tracy, and she was impelled to set her case <lb/>
before the statesman and take his counsel. So she <lb/>
<pb n="214"/>
poured out her heart, and he listened with painful <lb/>
solicitude. She concluded, pleadingly, with:</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i> tell me he is an impostor. I suppose he is, <lb/>
but doesn't it look to you as if he isn't? You are <lb/>
cool, you know, and outside; and so, maybe it can <lb/>
look to you as if he isn't one, when it can't to me. <lb/>
<i>Doesn't</i> it look to you as if he isn't? Couldn't you&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>can't</i> it look to you that way&#x2014;for&#x2014;for my sake?"</p>
<p>The poor man was troubled, but he felt obliged to <lb/>
keep in the neighborhood of the truth. He fought <lb/>
around the present detail a little while, then gave it up, <lb/>
and said he couldn't see his way to clearing Tracy.</p>
<p>"No," he said; "the truth is, he's an impostor."</p>
<p>"That is, you&#x2014;you feel a little certain, but not <lb/>
entirely&#x2014;oh, not <i>entirely</i>, Mr. Hawkins!"</p>
<p>"It's a pity to have to say it&#x2014;I do hate to say <lb/>
it&#x2014;but I don't think anything about it, I <i>know</i> he's <lb/>
an impostor."</p>
<p>"Oh, now, Mr. Hawkins, you <i>can't</i> go that far. A <lb/>
body <i>can't</i> really know it, you know. It isn't <i>proved</i> <lb/>
that he's not what he says he is."</p>
<p>Should he come out and make a clean breast of the <lb/>
whole wretched business? Yes&#x2014;at least, the most of <lb/>
it&#x2014;it ought to be done. So he set his teeth and <lb/>
went at the matter with determination, but purposing <lb/>
to spare the girl one pain&#x2014;that of knowing that <lb/>
Tracy was a criminal.</p>
<p>"Now I am going to tell you a plain tale; one not <lb/>
pleasant for me to tell or for you to hear, but we've <lb/>
got to stand it. I know all about that fellow, and I <lb/>
<i>know</i> he is no earl's son."</p>
<p>The girl's eyes flashed, and she said:</p>
<p>"I don't care a snap for that&#x2014;go on!"</p>
<p>This was so wholly unexpected that it at once ob- <lb/>
structed the narrative; Hawkins was not even sure that <lb/>
he had heard aright. He said:</p>
<pb n="215"/>
<p>"I don't know that I quite understand. Do you <lb/>
mean to say that if he was all right and proper other- <lb/>
wise, you'd be indifferent about the earl part of the <lb/>
business?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>"You'd be entirely satisfied with him, and wouldn't <lb/>
<i>care</i> for his not being an earl's son&#x2014;that <i>being</i> an <lb/>
earl's son wouldn't add any value to him?"</p>
<p>"Not the least value that I would care for. Why, <lb/>
Mr. Hawkins, I've gotten over all that day-dreaming <lb/>
about earldoms and aristocracies and all such nonsense, <lb/>
and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and con- <lb/>
tent with it; and it is to <i>him</i> I owe my cure. And as <lb/>
to anything being able to add a value to him, nothing <lb/>
can do that. He is the whole world to me, just as he <lb/>
is; he comprehends <i>all</i> the values there are&#x2014;then <lb/>
how can you <i>add</i> one?"</p>
<p>"She's pretty far gone." He said that to himself. <lb/>
He continued, still to himself, "I must change my <lb/>
plan again; I can't seem to strike one that will stand <lb/>
the requirements of this most variegated emergency <lb/>
five minutes on a stretch. Without making this fellow <lb/>
a criminal, I believe I will invent a name and a char- <lb/>
acter for him calculated to disenchant her. If it fails <lb/>
to do it, then I'll know that the next rightest thing to <lb/>
do will be to help her to her fate, poor thing, not <lb/>
hinder her."</p>
<p>Then he said aloud:</p>
<p>"Well, Gwendolen&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I want to be called Sally."</p>
<p>"I'm glad of it; I like it better myself. Well, <lb/>
then, I'll tell you about this man Snodgrass."</p>
<p>"Snodgrass! Is <i>that</i> his name?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;Snodgrass. The other's his <foreign lang="fre"><i>nom de plume</i></foreign>."</p>
<p>"It's hideous?"</p>
<p>"I know it is, but we can't help our names."</p>
<pb n="216"/>
<p>"And that is truly his real name&#x2014;and not Howard <lb/>
Tracy?"</p>
<p>Hawkins answered, regretfully:</p>
<p>"Yes; it seems a pity."</p>
<p>The girl sampled the name musingly once or twice:</p>
<p>"Snodgrass! Snodgrass! No, I could not endure <lb/>
that. I could not get used to it. No, I should call <lb/>
him by his first name. What is his first name?"</p>
<p>"His&#x2014;er&#x2014;his initials are S. M."</p>
<p>"His initials? I don't cary anything about his <lb/>
initials. I can't call him by his initials. What do <lb/>
they <i>stand</i> for?"</p>
<p>"Well, you see, his father was a physician, and <lb/>
he&#x2014;he&#x2014;well, he was an idolater of his profession, <lb/>
and he&#x2014;well, he was a very eccentric man, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What do they <i>stand</i> for? What are you shuffling <lb/>
about?"</p>
<p>"They&#x2014;well, they stand for Spinal Meningitis. <lb/>
His father being a phy&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I never heard such an infamous name! Nobody <lb/>
can ever call a person <i>that</i>&#x2014;a person they love. I <lb/>
wouldn't call an enemy by such a name. It sounds <lb/>
like an epithet." After a moment she added, with a <lb/>
kind of consternation, "Why, it would be <i>my</i> name! <lb/>
Letters would come with it on."</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;Mrs. Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass."</p>
<p>"Don't repeat it&#x2014;don't; I can't bear it. Was <lb/>
the father a lunatic?"</p>
<p>"No, that is not charged."</p>
<p>"I am glad of that, because that is transmis- <lb/>
sible. What do you think <i>was</i> the matter with him, <lb/>
then?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't really know. The family used to <lb/>
run a good deal to idiots, and so, maybe&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, there isn't any maybe about it. This one <lb/>
was an idiot."</p>
<pb n="217"/>
<p>"Well, yes&#x2014;he could have been. He was sus- <lb/>
pected."</p>
<p>"Suspected!" said Sally, with irritation. "Would <lb/>
one <i>suspect</i> there was going to be a dark time if he saw <lb/>
the constellations fall out of the sky? But that is <lb/>
enough about the idiot, I don't take any interest in <lb/>
idiots; tell me about the son."</p>
<p>"Very well then; this one was the eldest, but not <lb/>
the favorite. His brother, Zylobalsamum&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wait&#x2014;give me a chance to realize that. It is <lb/>
perfectly stupefying. Zylo&#x2014;what did you call it?"</p>
<p>"Zylobalsamum."</p>
<p>"I never heard such a name. It sounds like a dis- <lb/>
ease. Is it a disease?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think it's a disease. It's either Scrip- <lb/>
tural or&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, it's not Scriptural."</p>
<p>"Then it's anatomical. I knew it was one or the <lb/>
other. Yes, I remember now, it <i>is</i> anatomical. It's a <lb/>
ganglion&#x2014;a nerve center&#x2014;it is what is called the <lb/>
zylobalsamum process."</p>
<p>"Well, go on; and if you come to any more of <lb/>
them, omit the names; they make one feel so uncom- <lb/>
fortable."</p>
<p>"Very well, then. As I said, this one was not a <lb/>
favorite in the family, and so he was neglected in every <lb/>
way&#x2014;never sent to school, always allowed to asso- <lb/>
ciate with the worst and coarsest characters, and so of <lb/>
course he has grown up a rude, vulgar, ignorant, dissi- <lb/>
pated ruffian, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"He? It's no such thing! You ought to be more <lb/>
generous than to make such a statement as that about <lb/>
a poor young stranger who&#x2014;who&#x2014;why, he is the <lb/>
very opposite of that! He is considerate, courteous, <lb/>
obliging, modest, gentle, refined, cultivated&#x2014;<i>oh</i>, for <lb/>
shame! how can you say such things about him?"</p>
<pb n="218"/>
<p>"I don't blame you, Sally&#x2014;indeed, I haven't a <lb/>
word of blame for you being blinded by your affection <lb/>
&#x2014;blinded to these minor defects which are so manifest <lb/>
to others who&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Minor defects? Do you call these minor defects? <lb/>
What are murder and arson, pray?"</p>
<p>"It is a difficult question to answer straight off&#x2014; <lb/>
and of course estimates of such things vary with en- <lb/>
vironment. With us, out our way, they would not <lb/>
necessarily attract as much attention as with you, yet <lb/>
they are often regarded with disapproval&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Murder and arson are regarded with disapproval?"</p>
<p>"Oh, frequently."</p>
<p>"With disapproval! Who <i>are</i> those Puritans you <lb/>
are talking about? But wait&#x2014;how did you come to <lb/>
know so much about this family? Where did you get <lb/>
all this hearsay evidence?"</p>
<p>"Sally, it isn't hearsay evidence. That is the seri- <lb/>
ous part of it. I <i>knew</i> that family&#x2014;personally."</p>
<p>This was a surprise.</p>
<p>"You? You actually knew them?"</p>
<p>"Knew Zylo, as we used to call him, and knew his <lb/>
father, Dr. Snodgrass. I didn't know your own Snod- <lb/>
grass, but have had glimpses of him from time to time, <lb/>
and I heard about him all the time. He was the com- <lb/>
mon talk, you see, on account of his&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"On account of his not being a house-burner or an <lb/>
assassin, I suppose. That would have made him <lb/>
commonplace. Where did you know these people?"</p>
<p>"In Cherokee Strip."</p>
<p>"Oh, how preposterous! There are not enough <lb/>
people in Cherokee Strip to <i>give</i> anybody a reputa- <lb/>
tion, good or bad. There isn't a quorum. Why, the <lb/>
whole population consists of a couple of wagon loads <lb/>
of horse thieves."</p>
<p>Hawkins answered, placidly:</p>
<pb n="219"/>
<p>"Our friend was one of those wagon loads."</p>
<p>Sally's eyes burned, and her breath came quick and <lb/>
fast, but she kept a fairly good grip on her anger, and <lb/>
did not let it get the advantage of her tongue. The <lb/>
statesman sat still and waited for developments. He <lb/>
was content with his work. It was as handsome a <lb/>
piece of diplomatic art as he had ever turned out, he <lb/>
thought; and now let the girl make her own choice. <lb/>
He judged she would let her specter go; he hadn't a <lb/>
doubt of it, in fact; but anyway let the choice be <lb/>
made, and he was ready to ratify it and offer no further <lb/>
hindrance.</p>
<p>Meantime Sally had thought her case out and made <lb/>
up her mind. To the Major's disappointment the <lb/>
verdict was against him. Sally said:</p>
<p>"He has no friend but me, and I will not desert <lb/>
him now. I will not marry him if his moral character <lb/>
is bad; but if he can prove that it isn't, I will&#x2014;and <lb/>
he shall have the chance. To me he seems utterly <lb/>
good and dear; I've never seen anything about him <lb/>
that looked otherwise&#x2014;except, of course, his calling <lb/>
himself an earl's son. Maybe that is only vanity, and <lb/>
no real harm when you get to the bottom of it. I do <lb/>
<i>not</i> believe he is any such person as you have painted <lb/>
him. I want to see him. I want you to find him and <lb/>
send him to me. I will implore him to be honest with <lb/>
me, and tell me the whole truth, and not be afraid."</p>
<p>"Very well; if that is your decision, I will do it. <lb/>
But, Sally, you know he's poor, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> don't care anything about that. That's <lb/>
neither here nor there. Will you bring him to me?"</p>
<p>"I'll do it. When?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, it's getting towards dark now, and so <lb/>
you'll have to put it off till morning. But you <i>will</i> <lb/>
find him in the morning, <i>won't</i> you? Promise."</p>
<p>"I'll have him here by daylight."</p>
<pb n="220"/>
<p>"Oh, <i>now</i> you're your own old self again&#x2014;and <lb/>
lovelier than ever!"</p>
<p>"I couldn't ask fairer than that. Good-bye, dear."</p>
<p>Sally mused a moment alone; then said, earnestly, <lb/>
"I love him in <i>spite</i> of his name!" and went about <lb/>
her affairs with a light heart.</p>

<head><b>CHAPTER XXV.</b></head>
<p><smcap>Hawkins</smcap> went straight to the telegraph office and <lb/>
disburdened his conscience. He said to himself, <lb/>
"She's not going to give this galvanized cadaver up, <lb/>
that's plain. Wild horses can't pull her away from <lb/>
him. I've done my share; it's for Sellers to take an <lb/>
innings now." So he sent this message to New York: <lb/>
<q><i>Come back. Hire special train. She's going to marry the materializee</i>.</q></p>
<p>Meantime a note came to Rossmore Towers to say <lb/>
that the Earl of Rossmore had just arrived from Eng- <lb/>
land, and would do himself the pleasure of calling in <lb/>
the evening. Sally said to herself, "It is a pity he <lb/>
didn't stop in New York; but it's no matter; he can <lb/>
go up to-morrow and see my father. He has come <lb/>
over here to tomahawk papa very likely, or buy out <lb/>
his claim. This thing would have excited me a while <lb/>
back, but it has only one interest for me now, and <lb/>
only one value. I can say to&#x2014;to&#x2014;Spine, Spiny, <lb/>
Spinal&#x2014;I don't like any <i>form</i> of that name!&#x2014;I <lb/>
can say to him to-morrow, '<i>Don't</i> try to keep it up any <lb/>
more, or I shall have to tell you whom I have been <lb/>
talking with last night, and then you will be embar- <lb/>
rassed."</p>
<p>Tracy couldn't know he was to be invited for the <lb/>
morrow, or he might have waited. As it was, he was <lb/>
too miserable to wait any longer; for his last hope&#x2014; <lb/>
a letter&#x2014;had failed him. It was fully due to-day; <lb/>
it had not come. Had his father really flung him <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
away? It looked so. It was not like his father, but <lb/>
it surely looked so. His father was a rather tough <lb/>
nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son&#x2014; <lb/>
still, this implacable silence had a calamitous look. <lb/>
Anyway, Tracy would go to the Towers and&#x2014;then <lb/>
what? He didn't know; his head was tired out with <lb/>
thinking&#x2014;he wouldn't think about what he must do <lb/>
or say&#x2014;let it all take care of itself. So that he saw <lb/>
Sally once more he would be satisfied, happen what <lb/>
might; he wouldn't care.</p>
<p>He hardly knew how he got to the Towers, or when. <lb/>
He knew and cared for only one thing&#x2014;he was alone <lb/>
with Sally. She was kind, she was gentle, there was <lb/>
moisture in her eyes, and a yearning something in her <lb/>
face and manner which she could not wholly hide&#x2014; <lb/>
but she kept her distance. They talked. By and by <lb/>
she said, watching his downcast countenance out of the <lb/>
corner of her eye:</p>
<p>"It's so lonesome&#x2014;with papa and mamma gone. <lb/>
I try to read, but I can't seem to get interested in any <lb/>
book. I try the newspapers, but they do put such <lb/>
rubbish in them! You take up a paper and start to <lb/>
read something you think's interesting, and it goes on <lb/>
and on and on about how somebody&#x2014;well, Dr. Snod- <lb/>
grass, for instance&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Not a movement from Tracy, not the quiver of a <lb/>
muscle. Sally was amazed&#x2014;what command of him- <lb/>
self he must have! Being disconcerted, she paused so <lb/>
long that Tracy presently looked up wearily and said:</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I thought you were not listening. Yes, it <lb/>
goes on and on about this Dr. Snodgrass till you are <lb/>
<i>so</i> tired, and then about his younger son&#x2014;<i>the favorite <lb/>
son</i>&#x2014;Zylobalsamum Snodgrass&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Not a sign from Tracy, whose head was drooping <lb/>
again. What supernatural self-possession! Sally fixed <lb/>
<pb n="223"/>
her eye on him and began again, resolved to blast him <lb/>
out of his serenity this time if she knew how to apply <lb/>
the dynamite that is concealed in certain forms of <lb/>
words when those words are properly loaded with <lb/>
unexpected meanings.</p>
<p>"And next it goes on and on and on about the <lb/>
eldest son&#x2014;<i>not</i> the favorite, this one&#x2014;and how he is <lb/>
neglected in his poor barren boyhood, and allowed to <lb/>
grow up unschooled, ignorant, coarse, vulgar, the <lb/>
comrade of the community's scum, and become in <lb/>
his completed manhood a rude, profane, dissipated <lb/>
ruffian&#x2014;"</p>
<p>That head still dropped! Sally rose, moved softly <lb/>
and solemnly a step or two, and stood before Tracy&#x2014; <lb/>
his head came slowly up, his meek eyes met her intense <lb/>
ones&#x2014;then she finished, with deep impressiveness:</p>
<p>"&#x2014;named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass!"</p>
<p>Tracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue. <lb/>
The girl was outraged by this iron indifference and <lb/>
callousness, and cried out:</p>
<p>"What <i>are</i> you made of?"</p>
<p>"I? Why?"</p>
<p>"Haven't you <i>any</i> sensitiveness? Don't these things <lb/>
touch any poor <i>remnant</i> of delicate feeling in you?"</p>
<p>"N-no," he said, wonderingly, "they don't seem <lb/>
to. Why should they?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear me, <i>how</i> can you look so innocent, and <lb/>
foolish, and good, and empty, and gentle, and all that, <lb/>
right in the hearing of such things as those! Look <lb/>
me in the eye&#x2014;straight in the eye. There, now then, <lb/>
answer me without a flinch. Isn't Dr. Snodgrass your <lb/>
father, and isn't Zylobalsamum your brother" [here <lb/>
Hawkins was about to enter the room, but changed his <lb/>
mind upon hearing these words, and elected for a walk <lb/>
down town, and so glided swiftly away], "and isn't <lb/>
your name Spinal Meningitis, and isn't your father a <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
doctor and an idiot, like all the family for generations, <lb/>
and doesn't he name all his children after poisons and <lb/>
pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of <lb/>
the human body? Answer me, some way or somehow <lb/>
&#x2014;and quick. <i>Why</i> do you sit there looking like an <lb/>
envelope without any address on it and see me going <lb/>
mad before your face with suspense?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I wish I could do&#x2014;do&#x2014;I wish I could do <lb/>
something, <i>anything</i> that would give you peace again <lb/>
and make you happy; but I know of nothing&#x2014;I <lb/>
know of no way. I have never heard of these awful <lb/>
people before."</p>
<p>"What? Say it again!"</p>
<p>"I have never&#x2014;never in my life till now."</p>
<p>"Oh, you <i>do</i> look so honest when you say that! It <lb/>
<i>must</i> be true&#x2014;surely you <i>couldn't</i> look that way, you <lb/>
<i>wouldn't</i> look that way if it were not true&#x2014;<i>would</i> <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't and wouldn't. It <i>is</i> true. Oh, let us <lb/>
end this suffering&#x2014;take me back into your heart and <lb/>
confidence&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wait&#x2014;one more thing. Tell me you told that <lb/>
falsehood out of mere vanity and are sorry for it; that <lb/>
you're <i>not</i> expecting to ever wear the coronet of an <lb/>
earl&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Truly I am cured&#x2014;cured this very day&#x2014;I am <lb/>
<i>not</i> expecting it!"</p>
<p>"Oh, now you <i>are</i> mine! I've got you back in the <lb/>
beauty and glory of your unsmirched poverty and your <lb/>
honorable obscurity, and nobody shall ever take you <lb/>
from me again but the grave! And if&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"De Earl of Rossmore, fum Englan'!"</p>
<p>"My father!" The young man released the girl <lb/>
and hung his head.</p>
<p>The old gentleman stood surveying the couple&#x2014;the <lb/>
one with a strongly complimentary right eye, the other <lb/>
<pb n="225"/>
with a mixed expression done with the left. This is <lb/>
difficult, and not often resorted to. Presently his face <lb/>
relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness, and he <lb/>
said to his son:</p>
<p>"Don't you think you could embrace me, too?"</p>
<p>The young man did it with alacrity.</p>
<p>"Then you <i>are</i> the son of an earl after all," said <lb/>
Sally, reproachfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Then I won't have you!"</p>
<p>"Oh, but you know&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No, I will not. You've told me another fib."</p>
<p>"She's right. Go away and leave us. I want to <lb/>
talk with her."</p>
<p>Berkeley was obliged to go. But he did not go far. <lb/>
He remained on the premises. At midnight the con- <lb/>
ference between the old gentleman and the young girl <lb/>
was still going blithely on, but it presently drew to a <lb/>
close, and the former said:</p>
<p>"I came all the way over here to inspect you, my <lb/>
dear, with the general idea of breaking off this match if <lb/>
there were <i>two</i> fools of you, but as there's only one, <lb/>
you can have him if you'll take him."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I will, then! May I kiss you?"</p>
<p>"You may. Thank you. Now you shall have that <lb/>
privilege whenever you are good."</p>
<p>Meantime Hawkins had long ago returned and <lb/>
slipped up into the laboratory. He was rather dis- <lb/>
concerted to find his late invention, Snodgrass, there. <lb/>
The news was told him: that the English Rossmore <lb/>
was come, "and I'm his son, Viscount Berkeley, not <lb/>
Howard Tracy any more."</p>
<p>Hawkins was aghast. He said:</p>
<p>"Good gracious, then you're dead!"</p>
<p>"Dead?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you are&#x2014;we've got your ashes."</p>
<pb n="226"/>
<p>"Hang those ashes, I'm tired of them; I'll give <lb/>
them to my father."</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth <lb/>
into his head that this was really a flesh and blood <lb/>
young man, and not the insubstantial resurrection he <lb/>
and Sellers had so long supposed him to be. Then he <lb/>
said, with feeling:</p>
<p>"I'm so glad; so glad on Sally's account, poor <lb/>
thing. We took you for a departed materialized bank <lb/>
thief from Tahlequah. This will be a heavy blow to <lb/>
Sellers." Then he explained the whole matter to <lb/>
Berkeley, who said:</p>
<p>"Well, the Claimant must manage to stand the <lb/>
blow, severe as it is. But he'll get over the disap- <lb/>
pointment."</p>
<p>"Who&#x2014;the Colonel? He'll get over it the minute <lb/>
he invents a new miracle to take its place. And he's <lb/>
already at it by this time. But look here&#x2014;what do <lb/>
you suppose became of the man you've been <i>represent- <lb/>
ing</i> all this time?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I saved his clothes&#x2014;it was all I <lb/>
could do. I am afraid he lost his life."</p>
<p>"Well, you must have found twenty or thirty thou- <lb/>
sand dollars in those clothes in money or certificates of <lb/>
deposit."</p>
<p>"No, I found only five hundred and a trifle. I <lb/>
borrowed the trifle and banked the five hundred."</p>
<p>"What'll we do about it?"</p>
<p>"Return it to the owner."</p>
<p>"It's easy said, but not easy to manage. Let's <lb/>
leave it alone till we get Sellers's advice. And that <lb/>
reminds me. I've got to run and meet Sellers and ex- <lb/>
plain who you are <i>not</i> and who you <i>are</i>, or he'll come <lb/>
thundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying <lb/>
a phantom. But&#x2014;suppose your father came over <lb/>
here to break off the match?"</p>
<pb n="227"/>
<p>"Well, isn't he downstairs getting acquainted with <lb/>
Sally? That's all safe."</p>
<p>So Hawkins departed to meet and prepare the <lb/>
Sellerses.</p>
<p>Rossmore Towers saw great times and late hours <lb/>
during the succeeding week. The two earls were such <lb/>
opposites in nature that they fraternized at once. <lb/>
Sellers said privately that Rossmore was the most <lb/>
extraordinary character he had ever met&#x2014;a man just <lb/>
made out of the condensed milk of human kindness, <lb/>
yet with the ability to totally hide the fact from any <lb/>
but the most practiced character-reader; a man whose <lb/>
whole being was sweetness, patience, and charity, yet <lb/>
with a cunning so profound, an ability so marvelous in <lb/>
the acting of a double part, that many a person of <lb/>
considerable intelligence might live with him for cen- <lb/>
turies and never suspect the presence in him of these <lb/>
characteristics.</p>
<p>Finally there was a quiet wedding at the Towers, <lb/>
instead of a big one at the British embassy, with the <lb/>
militia and the fire brigades and the temperance organi- <lb/>
zations on hand in torchlight procession, as at first <lb/>
proposed by one of the earls. The art firm and Barrow <lb/>
were present at the wedding, and the tinner and Puss <lb/>
had been invited, but the tinner was ill and Puss was <lb/>
nursing him&#x2014;for they were engaged.</p>
<p>The Sellerses were to go to England with their new <lb/>
allies for a brief visit, but when it was time to take the <lb/>
train from Washington the Colonel was missing. <lb/>
Hawkins was going as far as New York with the party, <lb/>
and said he would explain the matter on the road. <lb/>
The explanation was in a letter left by the Colonel in <lb/>
Hawkins's hands. In it he promised to join Mrs. <lb/>
Sellers later in England, and then went on to say: <lb/>
<q>The truth is, my dear Hawkins, a mighty idea has been born to me <lb/>
within the hour, and I must not even stop to say good-bye to my dear ones. <lb/>
<pb n="228"/>
A man's highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones, and must be <lb/>
attended to with his best promptness and energy, at whatsoever cost to his <lb/>
affections or his convenience. And first of all a man's duties is his duty to <lb/>
his own honor&#x2014;he must keep that spotless. Mine is threatened. When <lb/>
I was feeling sure of my imminent future solidity, I forwarded to the Czar <lb/>
of Russia&#x2014;perhaps prematurely&#x2014;an offer for the purchase of Siberia, <lb/>
naming a vast sum. Since then an episode has warned me that the method <lb/>
by which I was expected to acquire this money&#x2014;materialization upon a <lb/>
scale of limitless magnitude&#x2014;is marred by a taint of temporary uncertainty. <lb/>
His imperial majesty may accept my offer at any moment. If this should <lb/>
occur now, I should find myself painfully embarrassed&#x2014;in fact, financially <lb/>
inadequate. I could not take Siberia. This would become known, and <lb/>
my credit would suffer.</q>
<q>Recently my private hours have been dark indeed, but the sun shines <lb/>
again now; I see my way; I shall be able to meet my obligation, and with- <lb/>
out having to ask an extension of the stipulated time, I think. This grand <lb/>
new idea of mine&#x2014;the sublimest I have ever conceived&#x2014;will save me <lb/>
whole, I am sure. I am leaving for San Francisco this moment to test it <lb/>
by the help of the great Lick telescope. Like all of my more notable dis- <lb/>
coveries and inventions, it is based upon hard, practical scientific laws; all <lb/>
other bases are unsound, and hence untrustworthy.</q>
<q>In brief, then, I have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing the <lb/>
climates of the earth according to the desire of the populations interested. <lb/>
That is to say, I will furnish climates to order, for cash or negotiable paper, <lb/>
taking the old climates in part payment, of course, at a fair discount, where <lb/>
they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and let out for hire to poor <lb/>
and remote communities not able to afford a good climate and not caring <lb/>
for an expensive one for mere display. My studies have convinced me <lb/>
that the regulation of climates and the breeding of new varieties at will <lb/>
from the old stock is a feasible thing; indeed, I am convinced that it <lb/>
has been done before, done in prehistoric times by now forgotten and <lb/>
unrecorded civilizations. Everywhere I find hoary evidences of artificial <lb/>
manipulation of climates in bygone times. Take the glacial period. Was <lb/>
that produced by accident? Not at all; it was done for money. I have <lb/>
a thousand proofs of it, and will some day reveal them.</q>
<q>I will confide to you an outline of my idea. It is to utilize the spots on <lb/>
the sun&#x2014;get control of them, you understand, and apply the stupendous <lb/>
energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the reorganization of <lb/>
our climates. At present they merely make trouble and do harm in the <lb/>
<pb n="229"/>
evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms; but once under <lb/>
humane and intelligent control this will cease, and they will become a boon <lb/>
to man.</q>
<q>I have my plan all marked out, whereby I hope and expect to acquire <lb/>
complete and perfect control of the sun-spots, also details of the method <lb/>
whereby I shall employ the same commercially; but I will not venture to go <lb/>
into particulars before the patents shall have been issued. I shall hope and <lb/>
expect to sell shop-rights to the minor countries at a reasonable figure, and <lb/>
supply a good business article of climate to the great empires at special <lb/>
rate, together with fancy brands for coronations, battles, and other great <lb/>
and particular occasions. There are billions of money in this enterprise, no <lb/>
expensive plant is required, and I shall begin to realize in a few days&#x2014;in <lb/>
a few weeks at furthest. I shall stand ready to pay cash for Siberia the <lb/>
moment it is delivered, and thus save my honor and my credit. I am con- <lb/>
fident of this.</q>
<q>I would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as I <lb/>
telegraph you, be it night or be it day. I wish you to take up all the <lb/>
country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many degrees <lb/>
south, and buy Greenland and Iceland at the best figure you can get now <lb/>
while they are cheap. It is my intention to move one of the tropics up <lb/>
there and transfer the frigid zone to the equator. I will have the entire <lb/>
Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next year, and will use the <lb/>
surplusage of the old climate, over and above what can be utilized on the <lb/>
equator, to reduce the temperature of opposition resorts. But I have said <lb/>
enough to give you an idea of the prodigious nature of my scheme and the <lb/>
feasible and enormously profitable character of it. I shall join all you <lb/>
happy people in England as soon as I shall have sold out some of my <lb/>
principal climates and arranged with the Czar about Siberia.</q>
<q>Meantime, watch for a sign from me. Eight days from now we shall <lb/>
be wide asunder; for I shall be on the border of the Pacific, and you far <lb/>
out on the Atlantic, approaching England. That day, if I am alive and my <lb/>
sublime discovery is proved and established, I will send you greeting, and <lb/>
my messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the solitudes of the sea; for <lb/>
I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk like drifting smoke, and you will <lb/>
know it for my love-sign, and will say, "Mulberry Sellers throws us a kiss <lb/>
across the universe."</q></p>

<p>A brief though violent thunder-storm which had raged over the city was <lb/>
passing away; but still, though the rain had ceased more than an hour <lb/>
before, wild piles of dark and coppery clouds, in which a fierce and rayless <lb/>
glow was laboring, gigantically overhung the grotesque and huddled vista of <lb/>
dwarf houses, while in the distance, sheeting high over the low, misty con- <lb/>
fusion of gables and chimneys, spread a pall of dead, leprous blue, suffused <lb/>
with blotches of dull, glistening yellow, and with black plague-spots of <lb/>
vapor floating and faint lightnings crinkling on its surface. Thunder, still <lb/>
muttering in the close and sultry air, kept the scared dwellers in the street <lb/>
within, behind their closed shutters; and all deserted, cowed, dejected, <lb/>
squalid, like poor, stupid, top-heavy things that had felt the wrath of the <lb/>
summer tempest, stood the drenched structures on either side of the narrow <lb/>
and crooked way, ghastly and picturesque under the giant canopy. Rain <lb/>
dripped wretchedly in slow drops of melancholy sound from their projecting <lb/>
eaves upon the broken flagging, lay there in pools or trickled into the <lb/>
swollen drains, where the fallen torrent sullenly gurgled on its way to the <lb/>
river.&#x2014;"<i>The Brazen Android:</i>" <i>W. D. O'Connor.</i></p>

<p>There was every indication of a dust-storm, though the sun still shone <lb/>
brilliantly. The hot wind had become wild and rampant. It was whipping <lb/>
up the sandy coating of the plain in every direction. High in the air were <lb/>
seen whirling spires and cones of sand&#x2014;a curious effect against the deep- <lb/>
blue sky. Below, puffs of sand were breaking out of the plain in every <lb/>
direction, as though the plain were alive with invisible horsemen. These <lb/>
sandy cloudlets were instantly dissipated by the wind; it was the larger <lb/>

this point of the track. He also knew these dust-storms of old; Bindarra <lb/>
was notorious for them. Without thinking twice, Alfred put spurs to his <lb/>
horse and headed for the hut. Before he had ridden half the distance the <lb/>
detached clouds of sand banded together in one dense whirlwind, and it <lb/>
was only owing to his horse's instinct that he did not ride wide of the hut <lb/>
altogether; for during the last half-mile he never saw the hut, until its <lb/>
outline loomed suddenly over his horse's ears; and by then the sun was <lb/>
invisible.&#x2014;"<i>A Bride from the Bush</i>."</p>

<head><b>THE PRIVATE HISTORY OF A CAMPAIGN <lb/>
THAT FAILED</b></head>
<p><smcap>You</smcap> have heard from a great many people who did <lb/>
something in the war; is it not fair and right <lb/>
that you listen a little moment to one who started out <lb/>
to do something in it, but didn't? Thousands entered <lb/>
the war, got just a taste of it, and then stepped out <lb/>
again permanently. These, by their very numbers, <lb/>
are respectable, and are therefore entitled to a sort of <lb/>
voice&#x2014;not a loud one, but a modest one; not a <lb/>
boastful one, but an apologetic one. They ought not <lb/>
to be allowed much space among better people&#x2014; <lb/>
people who did something. I grant that; but they <lb/>
ought at least to be allowed to state why they didn't <lb/>
do anything, and also to explain the process by which <lb/>
they didn't do anything. Surely this kind of light <lb/>
must have a sort of value.</p>
<p>Out West there was a good deal of confusion in <lb/>
men's minds during the first months of the great <lb/>
trouble&#x2014;a good deal of unsettledness, of leaning first <lb/>
this way, then that, then the other way. It was hard <lb/>
for us to get our bearings. I call to mind an instance <lb/>
of this. I was piloting on the Mississippi when the <lb/>
news came that South Carolina had gone out of the <lb/>
Union on the 20th of December, 1860. My pilot <lb/>
mate was a New Yorker. He was strong for the <lb/>
Union; so was I. But he would not listen to me with <lb/>
any patience; my loyalty was smirched, to his eye, <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
because my father had owned slaves. I said, in pallia- <lb/>
tion of this dark fact, that I had heard my father say, <lb/>
some years before he died, that slavery was a great <lb/>
wrong, and that he would free the solitary negro he <lb/>
then owned if he could think it right to give away the <lb/>
property of the family when he was so straitened in <lb/>
means. My mate retorted that a mere impulse was <lb/>
nothing&#x2014;anybody could pretend to a good impulse; <lb/>
and went on decrying my Unionism and libeling my <lb/>
ancestry. A month later the secession atmosphere <lb/>
had considerably thickened on the Lower Mississippi, <lb/>
and I became a rebel; so did he. We were together <lb/>
in New Orleans the 26th of January, when Louisiana <lb/>
went out of the Union. He did his full share of the <lb/>
rebel shouting, but was bitterly opposed to letting me <lb/>
do mine. He said that I came of bad stock&#x2014;of a <lb/>
father who had been willing to set slaves free. In the <lb/>
following summer he was piloting a Federal gunboat <lb/>
and shouting for the Union again, and I was in the <lb/>
Confederate army. I held his note for some borrowed <lb/>
money. He was one of the most upright men I <lb/>
ever knew, but he repudiated that note without hesi- <lb/>
tation because I was a rebel and the son of a man <lb/>
who owned slaves.</p>
<p>In that summer&#x2014;of 1861&#x2014;the first wash of the <lb/>
wave of war broke upon the shores of Missouri. Our <lb/>
State was invaded by the Union forces. They took <lb/>
possession of St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks, and some <lb/>
other points. The Governor, Claib Jackson, issued <lb/>
his proclamation calling out fifty thousand militia to <lb/>
repel the invader.</p>
<p>I was visiting in the small town where my boyhood <lb/>
had been spent&#x2014;Hannibal, Marion County. Several <lb/>
of us got together in a secret place by night and <lb/>
formed ourselves into a military company. One Tom <lb/>
Lyman, a young fellow of a good deal of spirit but of <lb/>
<pb n="237"/>
no military experience, was made captain; I was made <lb/>
second lieutenant. We had no first lieutenant; I do <lb/>
not know why; it was long ago. There were fifteen <lb/>
of us. By the advice of an innocent connected with <lb/>
the organization we called ourselves the Marion <lb/>
Rangers. I do not remember that any one found <lb/>
fault with the name. I did not; I thought it sounded <lb/>
quite well. The young fellow who proposed this title <lb/>
was perhaps a fair sample of the kind of stuff we were <lb/>
made of. He was young, ignorant, good-natured, <lb/>
well-meaning, trivial, full of romance, and given to <lb/>
reading chivalric novels and singing forlorn love-ditties. <lb/>
He had some pathetic little nickel-plated aristocratic <lb/>
instincts, and detested his name, which was Dunlap; <lb/>
detested it, partly because it was nearly as common <lb/>
in that region as Smith, but mainly because it had <lb/>
a plebeian sound to his ear. So he tried to ennoble <lb/>
it by writing it in this way: <i>d'Unlap</i>. That contented <lb/>
his eye, but left his ear unsatisfied, for people gave the <lb/>
new name the same old pronunciation&#x2014;emphasis on <lb/>
he front end of it. He then did the bravest thing that <lb/>
can be imagined&#x2014;a thing to make one shiver when <lb/>
one remembers how the world is given to resenting <lb/>
shams and affectations; he began to write his name <lb/>
so: <i>d' Un Lap</i>. And he waited patiently through the <lb/>
long storm of mud that was flung at this work of art, <lb/>
and he had his reward at last; for he lived to see that <lb/>
name accepted, and the emphasis put where he wanted <lb/>
it by people who had known him all his life, and to <lb/>
whom the tribe of Dunlaps had been as familiar as the <lb/>
rain and the sunshine for forty years. So sure of vic- <lb/>
tory at last is the courage that can wait. He said he <lb/>
had found, by consulting some ancient French chroni- <lb/>
cles, that the name was rightly and originally written <lb/>
d'Un Lap; and said that if it were translated into <lb/>
English it would mean Peterson: <i>Lap</i>, Latin or Greek, <lb/>
<pb n="238"/>
he said, for stone or rock, same as the French <i>pierre</i>, <lb/>
that is to say, Peter; <i>d'</i>, of or from; <i>un</i>, a or one; <lb/>
hence, d'Un Lap, of or from a stone or a Peter; that <lb/>
is to say, one who is the son of a stone, the son of a <lb/>
Peter&#x2014;Peterson. Our ilitia company were not <lb/>
learned, and the explanation confused them; so they <lb/>
called him Peterson Dunlap. He proved useful to us in <lb/>
his way; he named our camps for us, and he generally <lb/>
struck a name that was "no slouch," as the boys said.</p>
<p>That is one sample of us. Another was Ed Stevens, <lb/>
son of the town jeweler&#x2014;trim-built, handsome, grace- <lb/>
ful, neat as a cat; bright, educated, but given over <lb/>
entirely to fun. There was nothing serious in life to <lb/>
him. As far as he was concerned, this military expe- <lb/>
dition of ours was simply a holiday. I should say that <lb/>
about half of us looked upon it in the same way; not <lb/>
consciously perhaps, but unconsciously. We did not <lb/>
think; we were not capable of it. As for myself, I <lb/>
was full of unreasoning joy to be done with turning <lb/>
out of bed at midnight and four in the morning for a <lb/>
while; grateful to have a change, new scenes, new <lb/>
occupations, a new interest. In my thoughts that was <lb/>
as far as I went; I did not go into the details; as a <lb/>
rule, one doesn't at twenty-four.</p>
<p>Another sample was Smith, the blacksmith's appren- <lb/>
tice. This vast donkey had some pluck, of a slow and <lb/>
sluggish nature, but a soft heart; at one time he would <lb/>
knock a horse down for some impropriety, and at <lb/>
another he would get homesick and cry. However, he <lb/>
had one ultimate credit to his account which some of <lb/>
us hadn't: he stuck to the war, and was killed in <lb/>
battle at last.</p>
<p>Jo Bowers, another sample, was a huge, good- <lb/>
natured, flax-headed lubber; lazy, sentimental, full of <lb/>
harmless brag, a grumbler by nature; an experienced, <lb/>
industrious, ambitious, and often quite picturesque liar, <lb/>
<pb n="239"/>
and yet not a successful one, for he had had no intelli- <lb/>
gent training, but was allowed to come up just any <lb/>
way. This life was serious enough to him, and seldom <lb/>
satisfactory. But he was a good fellow anyway, and <lb/>
the boys all liked him. He was made orderly sergeant; <lb/>
Stevens was made corporal.</p>
<p>These samples will answer&#x2014;and they are quite fair <lb/>
ones. Well, this herd of cattle started for the war. <lb/>
What could you expect of them? They did as well as <lb/>
they knew how; but really what was justly to be ex- <lb/>
pected of them? Nothing, I should say. That is <lb/>
what they did.</p>
<p>We waited for a dark night, for caution and secrecy <lb/>
were necessary; then, towards midnight, we stole in <lb/>
couples and from various directions to the Griffith <lb/>
place, beyond the town; from that point we set out <lb/>
together on foot. Hannibal lies at the extreme south- <lb/>
eastern corner of Marion County, on the Mississippi <lb/>
River; our objective point was the hamlet of New <lb/>
London, ten miles away, in Ralls County.</p>
<p>The first hour was all fun, all idle nonsense and <lb/>
laughter. But that could not be kept up. The steady <lb/>
trudging came to be like work; the play had somehow <lb/>
oozed out of it; the stillness of the woods and the <lb/>
somberness of the night began to throw a depressing <lb/>
influence over the spirits of the boys, and presently <lb/>
the talking died out and each person shut himself up in <lb/>
his own thoughts. During the last half of the second <lb/>
hour nobody said a word.</p>
<p>Now we approached a log farmhouse where, accord- <lb/>
ing to report, there was a guard of five Union soldiers. <lb/>
Lyman called a halt; and there, in the deep gloom of <lb/>
the overhanging branches, he began to whisper a plan <lb/>
of assault upon that house, which made the gloom <lb/>
more depressing than it was before. It was a crucial <lb/>
moment; we realized, with a cold suddenness, that <lb/>
<pb n="240"/>
here was no jest&#x2014;we were standing face to face with <lb/>
actual war. We were equal to the occasion. In our <lb/>
response there was no hesitation, no indecision: we <lb/>
said that if Lyman wanted to meddle with those soldiers, <lb/>
he could go ahead and do it; but if he waited for us to <lb/>
follow him, he would wait a long time.</p>
<p>Lyman urged, pleaded, tried to shame us, but it had <lb/>
no effect. Our course was plain, our minds were made <lb/>
up: we would flank the farmhouse&#x2014;go out around. <lb/>
And that was what we did.</p>
<p>We struck into the woods and entered upon a rough <lb/>
time, stumbling over roots, getting tangled in vines, <lb/>
and torn by briers. At last we reached an open place <lb/>
in a safe region, and sat down, blown and hot, to cool <lb/>
off and nurse our scratches and bruises. Lyman was <lb/>
annoyed, but the rest of us were cheerful; we had <lb/>
flanked the farmhouse, we had made our first military <lb/>
movement, and it was a success; we had nothing to <lb/>
fret about, were were feeling just the other way. <lb/>
Horse-play and laughing began again; the expedition <lb/>
was become a holiday frolic once more.</p>
<p>Then we had two more hours of dull trudging and <lb/>
ultimate silence and depression; then, about dawn, we <lb/>
straggled into New London, soiled, heel-blistered, <lb/>
fagged with our little march, and all of us except <lb/>
Stevens in a sour and raspy humor and privately down <lb/>
on the war. We stacked our shabby old shotguns in <lb/>
Colonel Ralls's barn, and then went in a body and <lb/>
breakfasted with that veteran of the Mexican War. <lb/>
Afterwards he took us to a distant meadow, and there <lb/>
in the shade of a tree we listened to an old-fashioned <lb/>
speech from him, full of gunpowder and glory, full of <lb/>
that adjective-piling, mixed metaphor, and windy <lb/>
declamation which were regarded as eloquence in that <lb/>
ancient time and that remote region; and then he <lb/>
swore us on the Bible to be faithful to the State of <lb/>
<pb n="241"/>
Missouri and drive all invaders from her soil, no matter <lb/>
whence they might come or under what flag they might <lb/>
march. This mixed us considerably, and we could not <lb/>
make out just what service we were embarked in; but <lb/>
Colonel Ralls, the practiced politician and phrase- <lb/>
juggler, was not similarly in doubt; he knew quite <lb/>
clearly that he had invested us in the cause of the <lb/>
Southern Confederacy. He closed the solemnities by <lb/>
belting around me the sword which his neighbor, <lb/>
Colonel Brown, had worn at Buena Vista and Molino <lb/>
del Rey; and he accompanied this act with another <lb/>
impressive blast.</p>
<p>Then we formed in line of battle and marched four <lb/>
miles to a shady and pleasant piece of woods on the <lb/>
border of the far-reaching expanses of a flowery <lb/>
prairie. It was an enchanting region for war&#x2014;our <lb/>
kind of war.</p>
<p>We pierced the forest about half a mile, and took up <lb/>
a strong position, with some low, rocky, and wooded <lb/>
hills behind us, and a purling, limpid creek in front. <lb/>
Straightway half the command were in swimming and <lb/>
the other half fishing. The ass with the French name <lb/>
gave this position a romantic title, but it was too long, <lb/>
so the boys shortened and simplified it to Camp Ralls.</p>
<p>We occupied an old maple sugar camp, whose half- <lb/>
rotted troughs were still propped against the trees. A <lb/>
long corn-crib served for sleeping quarters for the <lb/>
battalion. On our left, half a mile away, were Mason's <lb/>
farm and house; and he was a friend to the cause. <lb/>
Shortly after noon the farmers began to arrive from <lb/>
several directions, with mules and horses for our use, <lb/>
and these they lent us for as long as the war might last, <lb/>
which they judged would be about three months. The <lb/>
animals were of all sizes, all colors, and all breeds. <lb/>
They were mainly young and frisky, and nobody in <lb/>
the command could stay on them long at a time; for <lb/>
<pb n="242"/>
we were town boys, and ignorant of horsemanship. <lb/>
The creature that fell to my share was a very small <lb/>
mule, and yet so quick and active that it could throw <lb/>
me without difficulty; and it did this whenever I got <lb/>
on it. Then it would bray&#x2014;stretching its neck out, <lb/>
laying its ears back, and spreading its jaws till you <lb/>
could see down to its works. It was a disagreeable <lb/>
animal in every way. If I took it by the bridle and <lb/>
tried to lead it off the grounds, it would sit down and <lb/>
brace back, and no one could budge it. However, <lb/>
I was not entirely destitute of military resources, and <lb/>
I did presently manage to spoil this game; for I had <lb/>
seen many a steamboat aground in my time, and knew <lb/>
a trick or two which even a grounded mule would be <lb/>
obliged to respect. There was a well by the corn-crib; <lb/>
so I substituted thirty fathom of rope for the bridle, <lb/>
and fetched him home with the windlass.</p>
<p>I will anticipate here sufficiently to say that we did <lb/>
learn to ride, after some days' practice, but never well. <lb/>
We could not learn to like our animals; they were not <lb/>
choice ones, and most of them had annoying peculiar- <lb/>
ities of one kind or another. Stevens's horse would <lb/>
carry him, when he was not noticing, under the huge <lb/>
excrescences which form on the trunks of oak trees, <lb/>
and wipe him out of the saddle; in this way Stevens <lb/>
got several bad hurts. Sergeant Bowers's horse was <lb/>
very large and tall, with slim, long legs, and looked <lb/>
like a railroad bridge. His size enabled him to reach <lb/>
all about, and as far as he wanted to, with his head; <lb/>
so he was always biting Bowers's legs. On the march, <lb/>
in the sun, Bowers slept a good deal; and as soon as <lb/>
the horse recognized that he was asleep he would reach <lb/>
around and bite him on the leg. His legs were black <lb/>
and blue with bites. This was the only thing that <lb/>
could ever make him swear, but this always did; <lb/>
whenever his horse bit him he always swore, and of <lb/>
<pb n="243"/>
course Stevens, who laughed at everything, laughed at <lb/>
this, and would even get into such convulsions over it <lb/>
as to lose his balance and fall off his horse; and then <lb/>
Bowers, already irritated by the pain of the horse-bite, <lb/>
would resent the laughter with hard language, and <lb/>
there would be a quarrel; so that horse made no end <lb/>
of trouble and bad blood in the command.</p>
<p>However I will get back to where I was&#x2014;our first <lb/>
afternoon in the sugar-camp. The sugar-troughs came <lb/>
very handy as horse-troughs, and we had plenty of <lb/>
corn to fill them with. I ordered Sergeant Bowers to <lb/>
feed my mule; but he said that if I reckoned he went <lb/>
to war to be a dry-nurse to a mule, it wouldn't take <lb/>
me very long to find out my mistake. I believed that <lb/>
this was insubordination, but I was full of uncertainties <lb/>
about everything military, and so I let the thing pass, <lb/>
and went and ordered Smith, the blacksmith's appren- <lb/>
tice, to feed the mule; but he merely gave me a large, <lb/>
cold, sarcastic grin, such as an ostensibly seven-year- <lb/>
old horse gives you when you lift his lip and find he is <lb/>
fourteen, and turned his back on me. I then went to <lb/>
the captain, and asked if it was not right and proper <lb/>
and military for me to have an orderly. He said it <lb/>
was, but as there was only one orderly in the corps, it <lb/>
was but right that he himself should have Bowers on <lb/>
his staff. Bowers said he wouldn't serve on anybody's <lb/>
staff; and if anybody thought he could make him, let <lb/>
him try it. So, of course, the thing had to be dropped; <lb/>
there was no other way.</p>
<p>Next, nobody would cook; it was considered a <lb/>
degradation; so we had no dinner. We lazed the <lb/>
rest of the pleasant afternoon away, some dozing under <lb/>
the trees, some smoking cob-pipes and talking sweet- <lb/>
hearts and war, some playing games. By late supper- <lb/>
time all hands were famished; and to meet the difficulty <lb/>
all hands turned to, on an equal footing, and gathered <lb/>
<pb n="244"/>
wood, built fires, and cooked the meal. Afterwards <lb/>
everything was smooth for a while; then trouble broke <lb/>
out between the corporal and the sergeant, each claim- <lb/>
ing to rank the other. Nobody knew which was the <lb/>
higher office; so Lyman had to settle the matter by <lb/>
making the rank of both officers equal. The com- <lb/>
mander of an ignorant crew like that has many troubles <lb/>
and vexations which probably do not occur in the <lb/>
regular army at all. However, with the song-singing <lb/>
and yarn-spinning around the camp-fire, everything <lb/>
presently became serene again; and by and by we <lb/>
raked the corn down level in one end of the crib, and <lb/>
all went to bed on it, tying a horse to the door, so that <lb/>
he would neigh if any one tried to get in.<ref target="n1">*</ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>It was always my impression that that was what the horse was there <lb/>
for, and I know that it was also the impression of at least one other of the <lb/>
command, for we talked about it at the time, and admired the military <lb/>
ingenuity of the device; but when I was out West, three years ago, I was <lb/>
told by Mr. A. G. Fuqua, a member of our company, that the horse was <lb/>
his; that the leaving him tied at the door was a matter of mere forgetful- <lb/>
ness, and that to attribute it to intelligent invention was to give him quite <lb/>
too much credit. In support of his position he called my attention to the <lb/>
suggestive fact that the artifice was not employed again. I had not thought <lb/>
of that before.</p></note></p>
<p>We had some horsemanship drill every forenoon; <lb/>
then, afternoons, we rode off here and there in squads <lb/>
a few miles, and visited the farmers' girls, and had a <lb/>
youthful good time, and got an honest good dinner or <lb/>
supper, and then home again to camp, happy and <lb/>
content.</p>
<p>For a time life was idly delicious, it was perfect; <lb/>
there was nothing to mar it. Then came some farmers <lb/>
with an alarm one day. They said it was rumored that <lb/>
the enemy were advancing in our direction from over <lb/>
Hyde's prairie. The result was a sharp stir among us, <lb/>
and general consternation. It was a rude awakening <lb/>
from our pleasant trance. The rumor was but a rumor <lb/>
<pb n="245"/>
&#x2014;nothing definite about it; so, in the confusion, we <lb/>
did not know which way to retreat. Lyman was for <lb/>
not retreating at all in these uncertain circumstances; <lb/>
but he found that if he tried to maintain that attitude <lb/>
he would fare badly, for the command were in no <lb/>
humor to put up with insubordination. So he yielded <lb/>
the point and called a council of war&#x2014;to consist of <lb/>
himself and the three other officers; but the privates <lb/>
made such a fuss about being left out that we had to <lb/>
allow them to remain, for they were already present, <lb/>
and doing the most of the talking too. The question <lb/>
was, which way to retreat; but all were so flurried that <lb/>
nobody seemed to have even a guess to offer. Except <lb/>
Lyman. He explained in a few calm words that, inas- <lb/>
much as the enemy were approaching from over <lb/>
Hyde's prairie, our course was simple: all we had to <lb/>
do was not to retreat <i>towards</i> him; any other direction <lb/>
would answer our needs perfectly. Everybody saw in <lb/>
a moment how true this was, and how wise; so Lyman <lb/>
got a great many compliments. It was now decided <lb/>
that we should fall back on Mason's farm.</p>
<p>It was after dark by this time, and as we could not <lb/>
know how soon the enemy might arrive, it did not <lb/>
seem best to try to take the horses and things with us; <lb/>
so we only took the guns and ammunition, and started <lb/>
at once. The route was very rough and hilly and <lb/>
rocky, and presently the night grew very black and <lb/>
rain began to fall; so we had a troublesome time of it, <lb/>
struggling and stumbling along in the dark; and soon <lb/>
some person slipped and fell, and then the next person <lb/>
behind stumbled over him and fell, and so did the rest, <lb/>
one after the other; and then Bowers came with the keg <lb/>
of powder in his arms, while the command were all <lb/>
mixed together, arms and legs, on the muddy slope; <lb/>
and so he fell, of course, with the keg, and this started <lb/>
the whole detachment down the hill in a body, and <lb/>
<pb n="246"/>
they landed in the brook at the bottom in a pile, and <lb/>
each that was undermost pulling the hair and scratch- <lb/>
ing and biting those that were on top of him; and <lb/>
those that were being scratched and bitten scratching <lb/>
and biting the rest in their turn, and all saying they <lb/>
would die before they would ever go to war again if <lb/>
they ever got out of this brook this time, and the in- <lb/>
vader might rot for all they cared, and the country <lb/>
along with him&#x2014;and all such talk as that, which was <lb/>
dismal to hear and take part in, in such smothered, <lb/>
low voices, and such a grisly dark place and so wet, <lb/>
and the enemy, maybe, coming any moment.</p>
<p>The keg of powder was lost, and the guns, too; so <lb/>
the growling and complaining continued straight along <lb/>
while the brigade pawed around the pasty hillside and <lb/>
slopped around in the brook hunting for these things; <lb/>
consequently we lost considerable time at this; and <lb/>
then we heard a sound, and held our breath and <lb/>
listened, and it seemed to be the enemy coming, <lb/>
though it could have been a cow, for it had a cough <lb/>
like a cow; but we did not wait, but left a couple of <lb/>
guns behind and struck out for Mason's again as briskly <lb/>
as we could scramble along in the dark. But we got <lb/>
lost presently among the rugged little ravines, and <lb/>
wasted a deal of time finding the way again, so it was <lb/>
after nine when we reached Mason's stile at last; and <lb/>
then before we could open our mouths to give the <lb/>
countersign several dogs came bounding over the <lb/>
fence, with great riot and noise, and each of them took <lb/>
a soldier by the slack of his trousers and began to back <lb/>
away with him. We could not shoot the dogs without <lb/>
endangering the persons they were attached to; so we <lb/>
had to look on helpless, at what was perhaps the most <lb/>
mortifying spectacle of the Civil War. There was <lb/>
light enough, and to spare, for the Masons had now <lb/>
run out on the porch with candles in their hands. The <lb/>
<pb n="247"/>
old man and his son came and undid the dogs without <lb/>
difficulty, all but Bowers's; but they couldn't undo his <lb/>
dog, they didn't know his combination; he was of the <lb/>
bull kind, and seemed to be set with a Yale time-lock; <lb/>
but they got him loose at last with some scalding water, <lb/>
of which Bowers got his share and returned thanks. <lb/>
Peterson Dunlap afterwards made up a fine name for <lb/>
this engagement, and also for the night march which <lb/>
preceded it, but both have long ago faded out of my <lb/>
memory.</p>
<p>We now went into the house, and they began to ask <lb/>
us a world of questions, whereby it presently came out <lb/>
that we did not know anything concerning who or what <lb/>
we were running from; so the old gentleman made <lb/>
himself very frank, and said we were a curious breed <lb/>
of soldiers, and guessed we could be depended on to <lb/>
end up the war in time, because no government could <lb/>
stand the expense of the shoe-leather we should cost it <lb/>
trying to follow us around. "Marion <i>Rangers!</i> good <lb/>
name, b'gosh!" said he. And wanted to know why <lb/>
we hadn't had a picket-guard at the place where the <lb/>
road entered the prairie, and why we hadn't sent out a <lb/>
scouting party to spy out the enemy and bring us an <lb/>
account of his strength, and so on, before jumping up <lb/>
and stampeding out of a strong position upon a mere <lb/>
vague rumor&#x2014;and so on, and so forth, till he made <lb/>
us all feel shabbier than the dogs had done, not half so <lb/>
enthusiastically welcome. So we went to bed ashamed <lb/>
and low-spirited; except Stevens. Soon Stevens began <lb/>
to devise a garment for Bowers which could be made <lb/>
to automatically display his battle-scars to the grateful, <lb/>
or to conceal them from the envious, according to his <lb/>
occasions; but Bowers was in no humor for this, so <lb/>
there was a fight, and when it was over Stevens had <lb/>
some battle-scars of his own to think about.</p>
<p>Then we got a little sleep. But after all we had <lb/>
<pb n="248"/>
gone through, our activities were not over for the <lb/>
night; for about two o'clock in the morning we heard <lb/>
a shout of warning from down the lane, accompanied <lb/>
by a chorus from all the dogs, and in a moment every- <lb/>
body was up and flying around to find out what the <lb/>
alarm was about. The alarmist was a horseman who <lb/>
gave notice that a detachment of Union soldiers was <lb/>
on its way from Hannibal with orders to capture and <lb/>
hang any bands like ours which it could find, and said <lb/>
we had no time to lose. Farmer Mason was in a flurry <lb/>
this time himself. He hurried us out of the house with <lb/>
all haste, and sent one of his negroes with us to show <lb/>
us where to hide ourselves and our telltale guns among <lb/>
the ravines half a mile away. It was raining heavily.</p>
<p>We struck down the lane, then across some rocky <lb/>
pasture-land which offered good advantages for stum- <lb/>
bling; consequently we were down in the mud most of <lb/>
the time, and every time a man went down he black- <lb/>
guarded the war, and the people that started it, and <lb/>
everybody connected with it, and gave himself the <lb/>
master dose of all for being so foolish as to go into it. <lb/>
At last we reached the wooded mouth of a ravine, and <lb/>
there we huddled ourselves under the streaming trees, <lb/>
and sent the negro back home. It was a dismal and <lb/>
heart-breaking time. We were like to be drowned <lb/>
with the rain, deafened with the howling wind and the <lb/>
booming thunder, and blinded by the lightning. It <lb/>
was, indeed, a wild night. The drenching we were <lb/>
getting was misery enough, but a deeper misery still <lb/>
was the reflection that the halter might end us before <lb/>
we were a day older. A death of this shameful sort <lb/>
had not occurred to us as being among the possibilities <lb/>
of war. It took the romance all out of the campaign, <lb/>
and turned our dreams of glory into a repulsive night- <lb/>
mare. As for doubting that so barbarous an order had <lb/>
been given, not one of us did that.</p>
<pb n="249"/>
<p>The long night wore itself out at last, and then the <lb/>
negro came to us with the news that the alarm had <lb/>
manifestly been a false one, and that breakfast would <lb/>
soon be ready. Straightway we were light-hearted <lb/>
again, and the world was bright, and life as full of <lb/>
hope and promise as ever&#x2014;for we were young then. <lb/>
How long ago that was! Twenty-four years.</p>
<p>The mongrel child of philology named the night's <lb/>
refuge Camp Devastation, and no soul objected. The <lb/>
Masons gave us a Missouri country breakfast, in Mis- <lb/>
sourian abundance, and we needed it: hot biscuits; <lb/>
hot "wheat bread," prettily criss-crossed in a lattice <lb/>
pattern on top; hot corn pone; fried chicken; bacon, <lb/>
coffee, eggs, milk, buttermilk, etc.; and the world may <lb/>
be confidently challenged to furnish the equal of such <lb/>
a breakfast, as it is cooked in the South.</p>
<p>We stayed several days at Mason's; and after all <lb/>
these years the memory of the dullness, and stillness, <lb/>
and lifelessness of that slumberous farmhouse still <lb/>
oppresses my spirit as with a sense of the presence of <lb/>
death and mourning. There was nothing to do, noth- <lb/>
ing to think about; there was no interest in life. The <lb/>
male part of the household were away in the fields all day, <lb/>
the women were busy and out of our sight; there was <lb/>
no sound but the plaintive wailing of a spinning-wheel, <lb/>
forever moaning out from some distant room&#x2014;the <lb/>
most lonesome sound in nature, a sound steeped and <lb/>
sodden with homesickness and the emptiness of life. <lb/>
The family went to bed about dark every night, and as <lb/>
we were not invited to intrude any new customs we <lb/>
naturally followed theirs. Those nights were a hun- <lb/>
dred years long to youths accustomed to being up till <lb/>
twelve. We lay awake and miserable till that hour <lb/>
every time, and grew old and decrepit waiting through <lb/>
the still eternities for the clock-strikes. This was no <lb/>
place for town boys. So at last it was with something <lb/>
<pb n="250"/>
very like joy that we received news that the enemy were <lb/>
on our track again. With a new birth of the old <lb/>
warrior spirit we sprang to our places in line of battle <lb/>
and fell back on Camp Ralls.</p>
<p>Captain Lyman had take a hint from Mason's talk, <lb/>
and he now gave orders that our camp should be <lb/>
guarded against surprise by the posting of pickets. I <lb/>
was ordered to place a picket at the forks of the road <lb/>
in Hyde's prairie. Night shut down black and threaten- <lb/>
ing. I told Sergeant Bowers to go out to that place <lb/>
and stay till midnight; and, just as I was expecting, <lb/>
he said he wouldn't do it. I tried to get others to go, <lb/>
but all refused. Some excused themselves on account <lb/>
of the weather; but the rest were frank enough to say <lb/>
they wouldn't go in any kind of weather. This kind <lb/>
of thing sounds odd now, and impossible, but there <lb/>
was no surprise in it at the time. On the contrary, it <lb/>
seemed a perfectly natural thing to do. There were <lb/>
scores of little camps scattered over Missouri where the <lb/>
same thing was happening. These camps were com- <lb/>
posed of young men who had been born and reared to <lb/>
a sturdy independence, and who did not know what it <lb/>
meant to be ordered around by Tom, Dick, and Harry, <lb/>
whom they had known familiarly all their lives, in the <lb/>
village or on the farm. It is quite within the proba- <lb/>
bilities that this same thing was happening all over the <lb/>
South. James Redpath recognized the justice of this <lb/>
assumption, and furnished the following instance in <lb/>
support of it. During a short stay in East Tennessee <lb/>
he was in a citizen colonel's tent one day talking, when <lb/>
a big private appeared at the door, and, without salute <lb/>
or other circumlocution, said to the colonel:</p>
<p>"Say, Jim, I'm a-goin' home for a few days."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Well, I hain't b'en there for a right smart while, <lb/>
and I'd like to see how things is comin' on."</p>
<pb n="251"/>
<p>"How long are you going to be gone?"</p>
<p>"'Bout two weeks."</p>
<p>"Well, don't be gone longer than that; and get <lb/>
back sooner if you can."</p>
<p>That was all, and the citizen officer resumed his con- <lb/>
versation where the private had broken it off. This <lb/>
was in the first months of the war, of course. The <lb/>
camps in our part of Missouri were under Brigadier- <lb/>
General Thomas H. Harris. He was a townsman of <lb/>
ours, a first-rate fellow, and well liked; but we had <lb/>
all familiarly known him as the sole and modest-sala- <lb/>
ried operator in our telegraph office, where he had to <lb/>
send about one dispatch a week in ordinary times, and <lb/>
two when there was a rush of business; consequently, <lb/>
when he appeared in our midst one day, on the wing, <lb/>
and delivered a military command of some sort, in a <lb/>
large military fashion, nobody was surprised at the <lb/>
response which he got from the assembled soldiery:</p>
<p>"Oh, now, what'll you take to <i>don't</i>, Tom Harris?"</p>
<p>It was quite the natural thing. One might justly <lb/>
imagine that we were hopeless material for war. And <lb/>
so we seemed, in our ignorant state; but there were <lb/>
those among us who afterwards learned the grim trade; <lb/>
learned to obey like machines; became valuable <lb/>
soldiers; fought all through the war, and came out at <lb/>
the end with excellent records. One of the very boys <lb/>
who refused to go out on picket duty that night, and <lb/>
called me an ass for thinking he would expose himself <lb/>
to danger in such a foolhardy way, had become dis- <lb/>
tinguished for intrepidity before he was a year older.</p>
<p>I did secure my picket that night&#x2014;not by authority, <lb/>
but by diplomacy. I got Bowers to go by agreeing to <lb/>
exchange ranks with him for the time being, and go <lb/>
along and stand the watch with him as his subordinate. <lb/>
We stayed out there a couple of dreary hours in the <lb/>
pitchy darkness and the rain, with nothing to modify <lb/>
<pb n="252"/>
the dreariness but Bowers's monotonous growlings at <lb/>
the war and the weather; then we began to nod, and <lb/>
presently found it next to impossible to stay in the <lb/>
saddle; so we gave up the tedious job, and went back <lb/>
to the camp without waiting for the relief guard. We <lb/>
rode into camp without interruption or objection from <lb/>
anybody, and the enemy could have done the same, <lb/>
for there were no sentries. Everybody was asleep; at <lb/>
midnight there was nobody to send out another picket, <lb/>
so none was sent. We never tried to establish a watch <lb/>
at night again, as far as I remember, but we generally <lb/>
kept a picket out in the daytime.</p>
<p>In that camp the whole command slept on the corn <lb/>
in the big corncrib; and there was usually a general <lb/>
row before morning, for the place was full of rats, and <lb/>
they would scramble over the boys' bodies and faces, <lb/>
annoying and irritating everybody; and now and then <lb/>
they would bite some one's toe, and the person who <lb/>
owned the toe would start up and magnify his English <lb/>
and begin to throw corn in the dark. The ears were <lb/>
half as heavy as bricks, and when they struck they <lb/>
hurt. The persons struck would respond, and inside <lb/>
of five minutes every man would be locked in a death- <lb/>
grip with his neighbor. There was a grievous deal of <lb/>
blood shed in the corncrib, but this was all that was <lb/>
spilt while I was in the war. No, that is not quite <lb/>
true. But for one circumstance it would have been <lb/>
all. I will come to that now.</p>
<p>Our scares were frequent. Every few days rumors <lb/>
would come that the enemy were approaching. In <lb/>
these cases we always fell back on some other camp of <lb/>
ours; we never stayed where we were. But the rumors <lb/>
always turned out to be false; so at last even we began <lb/>
to grow indifferent to them. One night a negro was <lb/>
sent to our corncrib with the same old warning: the <lb/>
enemy was hovering in our neighborhood. We all said <lb/>
<pb n="253"/>
let him hover. We resolved to stay still and be com- <lb/>
fortable. It was a fine warlike resolution, and no <lb/>
doubt we all felt the stir of it in our veins&#x2014;for a <lb/>
moment. We had been having a very jolly time, that <lb/>
was full of horse-play and school-boy hilarity; but <lb/>
that cooled down now, and presently the fast-waning <lb/>
fire of forced jokes and forced laughs died out alto- <lb/>
gether, and the company became silent. Silent and <lb/>
nervous. And soon uneasy&#x2014;worried&#x2014;apprehen- <lb/>
sive. We had said we would stay, and we were com- <lb/>
mitted. We could have been persuaded to go, but <lb/>
there was nobody brave enough to suggest it. An <lb/>
almost noiseless movement presently began in the dark <lb/>
by a general but unvoiced impulse. When the move- <lb/>
ment was completed each man knew that he was not <lb/>
the only person who had crept to the front wall and <lb/>
had his eye at a crack between the logs. No, we were <lb/>
all there; all there with our hearts in our throats, and <lb/>
staring out towards the sugar-troughs where the forest <lb/>
footpath came through. It was late, and there was a <lb/>
deep woodsy stillness everywhere. There was a veiled <lb/>
moonlight, which was only just strong enough to enable <lb/>
us to mark the general shape of objects. Presently a <lb/>
muffled sound caught our ears, and we recognized it as <lb/>
the hoof-beats of a horse or horses. And right away <lb/>
a figure appeared in the forest path; it could have <lb/>
been made of smoke, its mass had so little sharpness <lb/>
of outline. It was a man on horseback, and it seemed <lb/>
to me that there were others behind him. I got hold <lb/>
of a gun in the dark, and pushed it through a crack <lb/>
between the logs, hardly knowing what I was doing, I <lb/>
was so dazed with fright. Somebody said "Fire!" I <lb/>
pulled the trigger. I seemed to see a hundred flashes <lb/>
and hear a hundred reports; then I saw the man fall <lb/>
down out of the saddle. My first feeling was of sur- <lb/>
prised gratification; my first impulse was an apprentice- <lb/>
<pb n="254"/>
sportsman's impulse to run and pick up his game. <lb/>
Somebody said, hardly audibly, "Good&#x2014;we've got <lb/>
him!&#x2014;wait for the rest." But the rest did not come. <lb/>
We waited&#x2014;listened&#x2014;still no more came. There <lb/>
was not a sound, not the whisper of a leaf; just perfect <lb/>
stillness; an uncanny kind of stillness, which was all <lb/>
the more uncanny on account of the damp, earthy, <lb/>
late-night smells now rising and pervading it. Then, <lb/>
wondering, we crept stealthily out, and approached the <lb/>
man. When we got to him the moon revealed him <lb/>
distinctly. He was lying on his back, with his arms <lb/>
abroad; his mouth was open and his chest heaving <lb/>
with long gasps, and his white shirt-front was all <lb/>
splashed with blood. The thought shot through me <lb/>
that I was a murderer; that I had killed a man&#x2014;a <lb/>
man who had never done me any harm. That was the <lb/>
coldest sensation that ever went through my marrow. <lb/>
I was down by him in a moment, helplessly stroking <lb/>
his forehead; and I would have given anything then&#x2014; <lb/>
my own life freely&#x2014;to make him again what he had <lb/>
been five minutes before. And all the boys seemed to <lb/>
be feeling in the same way; they hung over him, full <lb/>
of pitying interest, and tried all they could to help him, <lb/>
and said all sorts of regretful things. They had for- <lb/>
gotten all about the enemy; they thought only of this <lb/>
one forlorn unit of the foe. Once my imagination <lb/>
persuaded me that the dying man gave me a reproach- <lb/>
ful look out of his shadowy eyes, and it seemed to me <lb/>
that I could rather he had stabbed me than done that. <lb/>
He muttered and mumbled like a dreamer in his sleep <lb/>
about his wife and his child; and I thought with a new <lb/>
despair, "This thing that I have done does not end <lb/>
with him; it falls upon <i>them</i> too, and they never did <lb/>
me any harm, any more than he."</p>
<p>In a little while the man was dead. He was killed in <lb/>
war; killed in fair and legitimate war; killed in battle, <lb/>
<pb n="255"/>
as you may say; and yet he was as sincerely mourned <lb/>
by the opposing force as if he had been their brother. <lb/>
The boys stood there a half-hour sorrowing over him, <lb/>
and recalling the details of the tragedy, and wondering <lb/>
who he might be, and if he were a spy, and saying <lb/>
that if it were to do over again they would not hurt <lb/>
him unless he attacked them first. It soon came out <lb/>
that mine was not the only shot fired; there were five <lb/>
others&#x2014;a division of the guilt which was a great relief <lb/>
to me, since it in some degree lightened and diminished <lb/>
the burden I was carrying. There were six shots fired <lb/>
at once; but I was not in my right mind at the time, <lb/>
and my heated imagination had magnified my one shot <lb/>
into a volley.</p>
<p>The man was not in uniform, and was not armed. <lb/>
He was a stranger in the country; that was all we ever <lb/>
found out about him. The thought of him got to <lb/>
preying upon me every night; I could not get rid of <lb/>
it. I could not drive it away, the taking of that un- <lb/>
offending life seemed such a wanton thing. And it <lb/>
seemed an epitome of war; that all war must be just <lb/>
that&#x2014;the killing of strangers against whom you feel <lb/>
no personal animosity; strangers whom, in other cir- <lb/>
cumstances, you would help if you found them in <lb/>
trouble, and who would help you if you needed it. <lb/>
My campaign was spoiled. It seemed to me that I was <lb/>
not rightly equipped for this awful business; that war <lb/>
was intended for men, and I for a child's nurse. I <lb/>
resolved to retire from this avocation of sham soldier- <lb/>
ship while I could save some remnant of my self- <lb/>
respect. These morbid thoughts clung to me against <lb/>
reason; for at bottom I did not believe I had touched <lb/>
that man. The law of probabilities decreed me guilt- <lb/>
less of his blood; for in all my small experience with <lb/>
guns I had never hit anything I had tried to hit, and I <lb/>
knew I had done my best to hit him. Yet there was <lb/>
<pb n="256"/>
no solace in the thought. Against a diseased imagina- <lb/>
tion demonstration goes for nothing.</p>
<p>The rest of my war experience was of a piece with <lb/>
what I have already told of it. We kept monotonously <lb/>
falling back upon one camp or another, and eating up <lb/>
the country. I marvel now at the patience of the <lb/>
farmers and their families. They ought to have shot <lb/>
us; on the contrary, they were as hospitably kind and <lb/>
courteous to us as if we had deserved it. In one of <lb/>
these camps we found Ab Grimes, an Upper Mississippi <lb/>
pilot, who afterwards became famous as a dare-devil <lb/>
rebel spy, whose career bristled with desperate adven- <lb/>
tures. The look and style of his comrades suggested <lb/>
that they had not come into the war to play, and their <lb/>
deeds made good the conjecture later. They were fine <lb/>
horsemen and good revolver shots; but their favorite <lb/>
arm was the lasso. Each had one at his pommel, and <lb/>
could snatch a man out of the saddle with it every <lb/>
time, on a full gallop, at any reasonable distance.</p>
<p>In another camp the chief was a fierce and profane <lb/>
old blacksmith of sixty, and he had furnished his <lb/>
twenty recruits with gigantic home-made bowie-knives, <lb/>
to be swung with two hands, like the <i>machetes</i> of the <lb/>
Isthmus. It was a grisly spectacle to see that earnest <lb/>
band practicing their murderous cuts and slashes under <lb/>
the eye of that remorseless old fanatic.</p>
<p>The last camp which we fell back upon was in a <lb/>
hollow near the village of Florida, where I was born&#x2014; <lb/>
in Monroe County. Here we were warned one day <lb/>
that a Union colonel was sweeping down on us with a <lb/>
whole regiment at his heel. This looked decidedly <lb/>
serious. Our boys went apart and consulted; then we <lb/>
went back and told the other companies present that <lb/>
the war was a disappointment to us, and we were going <lb/>
to disband. They were getting ready themselves to <lb/>
fall back on some place or other, and were only waiting <lb/>
<pb n="257"/>
for General Tom Harris, who was expected to arrive at <lb/>
any moment; so they tried to persuade us to wait a <lb/>
little while, but the majority of us said no, we were ac- <lb/>
customed to falling back, and didn't need any of Tom <lb/>
Harris's help; we could get along perfectly well with- <lb/>
out him&#x2014;and save time, too. So about half of our <lb/>
fifteen, including myself, mounted and left on the in- <lb/>
stant; the others yielded to persuasion and stayed&#x2014; <lb/>
stayed through the war.</p>
<p>An hour later we met General Harris on the road, <lb/>
with two or three people in his company&#x2014;his staff, <lb/>
probably, but we could not tell; none of them were in <lb/>
uniform; uniforms had not come into vogue among us <lb/>
yet. Harris ordered us back; but we told him there <lb/>
was a Union colonel coming with a whole regiment in <lb/>
his wake, and it looked as if there was going to be a <lb/>
disturbance; so we had concluded to go home. He <lb/>
raged a little, but it was of no use; our minds were <lb/>
made up. We had done our share; had killed one <lb/>
man, exterminated one army, such as it was; let him <lb/>
go and kill the rest, and that would end the war. I <lb/>
did not see that brisk young general again until last <lb/>
year; then he was wearing white hair and whiskers.</p>
<p>In time I came to know that Union colonel whose <lb/>
coming frightened me out of the war and crippled the <lb/>
Southern cause to that extent&#x2014;General Grant. I <lb/>
came within a few hours of seeing him when he was as <lb/>
unknown as I was myself; at a time when anybody <lb/>
could have said, "Grant?&#x2014;Ulysses S. Grant? I do <lb/>
not remember hearing the name before." It seems <lb/>
difficult to realize that there was once a time when such <lb/>
remark could be rationally made; but there <i>was</i>, and I <lb/>
was within a few miles of the place and the occasion, <lb/>
too, though proceeding in the other direction.</p>
<p>The thoughtful will not throw this war paper of mine <lb/>
lightly aside as being valueless. It has this value: it <lb/>
<pb n="258"/>
is a not unfair picture of what went on in many and <lb/>
many a militia camp in the first months of the rebellion, <lb/>
when the green recruits were without discipline, without <lb/>
the steadying and heartening influence of trained lead- <lb/>
ers; when all their circumstances were new and strange, <lb/>
and charged with exaggerated terrors, and before the <lb/>
invaluable experience of actual collision in the field <lb/>
had turned them from rabbits into soldiers. If this <lb/>
side of the picture of that early day has not before <lb/>
been put into history, then history has been to that <lb/>
degree incomplete, for it had and has its rightful place <lb/>
there. There was more Bull Run material scattered <lb/>
through the early camps of this country than exhibited <lb/>
itself at Bull Run. And yet it learned its trade pres- <lb/>
ently, and helped to fight the great battles later. I <lb/>
could have become a soldier myself if I had waited. <lb/>
I had got part of it learned; I knew more about re- <lb/>
treating than the man that invented retreating.</p>

titles and call him Lieutenant-General Lord Arthur <lb/>
Scoresby, Y.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc. What a fas- <lb/>

man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard of so many <lb/>
thousands of times since that day, thirty years before, <lb/>
when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a <lb/>
Crimean battlefield, to remain forever celebrated. It <lb/>
was food and drink to me to look, and look, and look <lb/>
at that demi-god; scanning, searching, noting: the <lb/>
quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his counte- <lb/>
nance; the simple honesty that expressed itself all <lb/>
over him; the sweet unconsciousness of his greatness <lb/>
&#x2014;unconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes <lb/>
fastened upon him, unconsciousness of the deep, <lb/>
loving, sincere worship welling out of the breasts of <lb/>
those people and flowing towards him.</p>

glimmered in his eyes and he leaned down and mut- <lb/>

banquet with a gesture:</p>
<p>"Privately&#x2014;he's an absolute fool."</p>
<p>This verdict was a great surprise to me. If its sub- <lb/>
ject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon, my <lb/>
astonishment could not have been greater. Two things <lb/>
I was well aware of: that the Reverend was a man of <lb/>
strict veracity and that his judgment of men was good. <lb/>
Therefore I knew, beyond doubt or question, that the <lb/>
world was mistaken about this hero: he <i>was</i> a fool. <lb/>
So I meant to find out, at a convenient moment, how <lb/>
the Reverend, all solitary and alone, had discovered <lb/>
the secret.</p>
<p>Some days later the opportunity came, and this is <lb/>
what the Reverend told me:</p>
<p>About forty years ago I was an instructor in the <lb/>
military academy at Woolwich. I was present in one <lb/>
of the sections when young Scoresby underwent his <lb/>
preliminary examination. I was touched to the quick <lb/>
with pity, for the rest of the class answered up brightly <lb/>
and handsomely, while he&#x2014;why, dear me, he didn't <lb/>
know <i>anything</i>, so to speak. He was evidently good, <lb/>
and sweet, and lovable, and guileless; and so it was <lb/>
exceedingly painful to see him stand there, as serene <lb/>
as a graven image, and deliver himself of answers <lb/>
which were veritably miraculous for stupidity and igno- <lb/>
rance. All the compassion in me was aroused in his <lb/>
behalf. I said to myself, when he comes to be ex- <lb/>
amined again he will be flung over, of course; so it <lb/>
will be simply a harmless act of charity to ease his fall <lb/>
as much as I can. I took him aside and found that <lb/>
he knew a little of C&#x00E6;sar's history; and as he didn't <lb/>
know anything else, I went to work and drilled him <lb/>
like a galley-slave on a certain line of stock questions <lb/>
<pb n="261"/>
concerning C&#x00E6;sar which I knew would be used. If <lb/>
you'll believe me, he went through with flying colors <lb/>
on examination day! He went through on that purely <lb/>
superficial "cram," and got compliments too, while <lb/>
others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got <lb/>
plucked. By some strangely lucky accident&#x2014;an acci- <lb/>
dent not likely to happen twice in a century&#x2014;he was <lb/>
asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his <lb/>
drill.</p>
<p>It was stupefying. Well, all through his course I <lb/>
stood by him, with something of the sentiment which <lb/>
a mother feels for a crippled child; and he always <lb/>
saved himself&#x2014;just by miracle, apparently.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the thing that would expose him <lb/>
and kill him at last was mathematics. I resolved to <lb/>
make his death as easy as I could; so I drilled him <lb/>
and crammed him, and crammed him and drilled him, <lb/>
just on the line of questions which the examiners <lb/>
would be most likely to use, and then launched him <lb/>
on his fate. Well, sir, try to conceive of the result: <lb/>
to my consternation, he took the first prize! And <lb/>
with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compli- <lb/>
ments.</p>
<p>Sleep? There was no more sleep for me for a <lb/>
week. My conscience tortured me day and night. <lb/>
What I had done I had done purely through charity, <lb/>
and only to ease the poor youth's fall. I never had <lb/>
dreamed of any such preposterous results as the thing <lb/>
that had hapened. I felt as guilty and miserable as <lb/>
the creator of Frankenstein. Here was a wooden-head <lb/>
whom I had put in the way of glittering promotions <lb/>
and prodigious responsibilities, and but one thing could <lb/>
happen: he and his responsibilities would all go to <lb/>
ruin together at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>The Crimean War had just broken out. Of course <lb/>
there had to be a war, I said to myself. We couldn't <lb/>
<pb n="262"/>
have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before <lb/>
he is found out. I waited for the earthquake. It <lb/>
came. And it made me reel when it did come. He <lb/>
was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching <lb/>
regiment! Better men grow old and gray in the service <lb/>
before they climb to a sublimity like that. And who <lb/>
could ever have foreseen that they would go and put <lb/>
such a load of responsibility on such green and inade- <lb/>
quate shoulders? I could just barely have stood it if <lb/>
they had made him a cornet; but a captain&#x2014;think of <lb/>
it! I thought my hair would turn white.</p>
<p>Consider what I did&#x2014;I who so loved repose and <lb/>
inaction. I said to myself, I am responsible to the <lb/>
country for this, and I must go along with him and <lb/>
protect the country against him as far as I can. So I <lb/>
took my poor little capital that I had saved up through <lb/>
years of work and grinding economy, and went with a <lb/>
sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment, and away <lb/>
we went to the field.</p>
<p>And there&#x2014;oh, dear, it was awful. Blunders?&#x2014; <lb/>
why, he never did anything <i>but</i> blunder. But, you <lb/>
see, nobody was in the fellow's secret. Everybody <lb/>
had him focused wrong, and necessarily misinterpreted <lb/>
his performance every time. Consequently they took <lb/>
his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius. They <lb/>
did, honestly! His mildest blunders were enough to <lb/>
make a man in his right mind cry; and they did make <lb/>
me cry&#x2014;and rage and rave, too, privately. And the <lb/>
thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension <lb/>
was the fact that every fresh blunder he made increased <lb/>
the luster of his reputation! I kept saying to myself, <lb/>
he'll get so high, that when discovery does finally <lb/>
come, it will be like the sun falling out of the sky.</p>
<p>He went right along up, from grade to grade, over <lb/>
the dead bodies of his superiors, until at last, in the <lb/>
hottest moment of the battle of&#x2026;&#x2026;down went our <lb/>
<pb n="263"/>
colonel, and my heart jumped into my mouth, for <lb/>
Scoresby was next in rank! Now for it, said I; we'll <lb/>
all land in Sheol in ten minutes, sure.</p>
<p>The battle was awfully hot; the allies were steadily <lb/>
giving way all over the field. Our regiment occupied <lb/>
a position that was vital; a blunder now must be de- <lb/>
struction. At this crucial moment, what does this <lb/>
immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its <lb/>
place and order a charge over a neighboring hill where <lb/>
there wasn't a suggestion of an enemy! "There you <lb/>
go!" I said to myself; "this <i>is</i> the end at last."</p>
<p>And away we did go, and were over the shoulder of <lb/>
the hill before the insane movement could be discovered <lb/>
and stopped. And what did we find? An entire and <lb/>
unsuspected Russian army in reserve! And what hap- <lb/>
pened? We were eaten up? That is necessarily what <lb/>
would have happened in ninety-nine cases out of a <lb/>
hundred. But no; those Russians argued that no <lb/>
single regiment would come browsing around there at <lb/>
such a time. It must be the entire English army, and <lb/>
that the sly Russian game was detected and blocked; <lb/>
so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell, <lb/>
over the hill and down into the field, in wild confusion, <lb/>
and we after them; they themselves broke the solid <lb/>
Russian center in the field, and tore through, and in <lb/>
no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever <lb/>
saw, and the defeat of the allies was turned into a <lb/>
sweeping and splendid victory! Marshal Canrobert <lb/>
looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration, and <lb/>
delight; and sent right off for Scoresby, and hugged <lb/>
him, and decorated him on the field, in presence of all <lb/>
the armies!</p>
<p>And what was Scoresby's blunder that time? Merely <lb/>
the mistaking his right hand for his left&#x2014;that was all. <lb/>
An order had come to him to fall back and support <lb/>
our right; and instead, he fell <i>forward</i> and went over <lb/>
<pb n="264"/>
the hill to the left. But the name he won that day as <lb/>
a marvelous military genius filled the world with his <lb/>
glory, and that glory will never fade while history <lb/>
books last.</p>
<p>He is just as good and sweet and lovable and unpre- <lb/>
tending as a man can be, but he doesn't know enough <lb/>
to come in when it rains. Now that is absolutely true. <lb/>
He is the supremest ass in the universe; and until half <lb/>
an hour ago nobody knew it but himself and me. He <lb/>
has been pursued, day by day and year by year, by a <lb/>
most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness. He has <lb/>
been a shining soldier in all our wars for a generation; <lb/>
he has littered his whole military life with blunders, <lb/>
and yet has never committed one that didn't make him <lb/>
a knight or a baronet or a lord or something. Look <lb/>
at his breast; why, he is just clothed in domestic and <lb/>
foreign decorations. Well, sir, every one of them is <lb/>
the record of some shouting stupidity or other; and <lb/>
taken together, they are proof that the very best thing <lb/>
in all this world that can befall a man is to be born <lb/>
lucky. I say again, as I said at the banquet, Scoresby's <lb/>
an absolute fool.</p>

<head><b>A CURIOUS EXPERIENCE</b></head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> is the story which the Major told me, as nearly <lb/>
as I can recall it:</p>
<p>In the winter of 1862&#x2013;3 I was commandant of Fort <lb/>
Trumbull, at New London, Conn. Maybe our life <lb/>
there was not so brisk as life at "the front"; still it <lb/>
was brisk enough, in its way&#x2014;one's brains didn't <lb/>
cake together there for lack of something to keep <lb/>
them stirring. For one thing, all the Northern atmos- <lb/>
phere at that time was thick with mysterious rumors&#x2014; <lb/>
rumors to the effect that rebel spies were flitting every- <lb/>
where, and getting ready to blow up our Northern <lb/>
forts, burn our hotels, send infected clothing into our <lb/>
towns, and all that sort of thing. You remember it. <lb/>
All this had a tendency to keep us awake, and knock <lb/>
the traditional dullness out of garrison life. Besides, <lb/>
ours was a recruiting station&#x2014;which is the same as <lb/>
saying we hadn't any time to waste in dozing, or <lb/>
dreaming, or fooling around. Why, with all our watch- <lb/>
fulness, fifty per cent. of a day's recruits would leak <lb/>
out of our hands and give us the slip the same night. <lb/>
The bounties were so prodigious that a recruit could <lb/>
pay a sentinel three or four hundred dollars to let him <lb/>
escape, and still have enough of his bounty-money left <lb/>
to constitute a fortune for a poor man. Yes, as I said <lb/>
before, our life was not drowsy.</p>
<p>Well, one day I was in my quarters alone, doing <lb/>
<pb n="266"/>
some writing, when a pale and ragged lad of fourteen <lb/>
or fifteen entered, made a neat bow, and said:</p>
<p>"I believe recruits are received here?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Will you please enlist me, sir?"</p>
<p>"Dear me, no! You are too young, my boy, and <lb/>
too small."</p>
<p>A disappointed look came into his face, and quickly <lb/>
deepened into an expression of despondency. He <lb/>
turned slowly away, as if to go; hesitated, then faced <lb/>
me again, and said, in a tone that went to my heart:</p>
<p>"I have no home, and not a friend in the world. If <lb/>
you <i>could</i> only enlist me!"</p>
<p>But of course the thing was out of the question, and <lb/>
I said so as gently as I could. Then I told him to sit <lb/>
down by the stove and warm himself, and added:</p>
<p>"You shall have something to eat, presently. You <lb/>
are hungry?"</p>
<p>He did not answer; he did not need to: the grati- <lb/>
tude in his big, soft eyes was more eloquent than any <lb/>
words could have been. He sat down by the stove, <lb/>
and I went on writing. Occasionally I took a furtive <lb/>
glance at him. I noticed that his clothes and shoes, <lb/>
although soiled and damaged, were of good style and <lb/>
material. This fact was suggestive. To it I added the <lb/>
facts that his voice was low and musical; his eyes deep <lb/>
and melancholy; his carriage and address gentlemanly; <lb/>
evidently the poor chap was in trouble. As a result, I <lb/>
was interested.</p>
<p>However, I became absorbed in my work by and <lb/>
by, and forgot all about the boy. I don't know how <lb/>
long this lasted; but, at length, I happened to look <lb/>
up. The boy's back was towards me, but his face was <lb/>
turned in such a way that I could see one of his cheeks <lb/>
&#x2014;and down that cheek a rill of noiseless tears was <lb/>
flowing.</p>
<pb n="267"/>
<p>"God bless my soul!" I said to myself; "I forgot <lb/>
the poor rat was starving." Then I made amends for <lb/>
my brutality by saying to him, "Come along, my lad; <lb/>
you shall dine with <i>me;</i> I am alone to-day."</p>
<p>He gave me another of those grateful looks, and a <lb/>
happy light broke in his face. At the table he stood <lb/>
with his hand on his chair-back until I was seated, then <lb/>
seated himself. I took up my knife and fork and&#x2014; <lb/>
well, I simply held them, and kept still; for the boy <lb/>
had inclined his head and was saying a silent grace. <lb/>
A thousand hallowed memories of home and my child- <lb/>
hood poured in upon me, and I sighed to think how <lb/>
far I had drifted from religion and its balm for hurt <lb/>
minds, its comfort and solace and support.</p>
<p>As our meal progressed I observed that young <lb/>
Wicklow&#x2014;Robert Wicklow was his full name&#x2014;knew <lb/>
what to do with his napkin; and&#x2014;well, in a word, I <lb/>
observed that he was a boy of good breeding; never <lb/>
mind the details. He had a simple frankness, too, <lb/>
which won upon me. We talked mainly about himself, <lb/>
and I had no difficulty in getting his history out of <lb/>
him. When he spoke of his having been born and <lb/>
reared in Louisiana, I warmed to him decidedly, for I <lb/>
spent some time down there. I knew all the "coast" <lb/>
region of the Mississippi, and loved it, and had not <lb/>
been long enough away from it for my interest in it to <lb/>
begin to pale. The very names that fell from his lips <lb/>
sounded good to me&#x2014;so good that I steered the talk <lb/>
in directions that would bring them out. Baton Rouge, <lb/>
Plaquemine, Donaldsonville, Sixty-mile Point, Bonnet- <lb/>
Carr&#x00E8;, the Stock Landing, Carrollton, the Steam- <lb/>
ship Landing, the Steamboat Landing, New Orleans, <lb/>
Tchoupitoulas Street, the Esplanade, the Rue des Bons <lb/>
Enfants, the St. Charles Hotel, the Tivoli Circle, the <lb/>
Shell Road, Lake Pontchartrain; and it was particu- <lb/>
larly delightful to me to hear once more of the <i>R. E.</i> <lb/>
<pb n="268"/>
<i>Lee</i>, the <i>Natchez</i>, the <i>Eclipse</i>, the <i>General Quitman</i>, <lb/>
the <i>Duncan F. Kenner</i>, and other old familiar steam- <lb/>
boats. It was almost as good as being back there, <lb/>
these names so vividly reproduced in my mind the <lb/>
look of the things they stood for. Briefly, this was <lb/>
little Wicklow's history:</p>
<p>When the war broke out, he and his invalid aunt and <lb/>
his father were living near Baton Rouge, on a great <lb/>
and rich plantation which had been in the family for <lb/>
fifty years. The father was a Union man. He was <lb/>
persecuted in all sorts of ways, but clung to his princi- <lb/>
ples. At last one night masked men burned his man- <lb/>
sion down, and the family had to fly for their lives. <lb/>
They were hunted from place to place, and learned all <lb/>
there was to know about poverty, hunger, and distress. <lb/>
The invalid aunt found relief at last: misery and ex- <lb/>
posure killed her; she died in an open field, like a <lb/>
tramp, the rain beating upon her and the thunder <lb/>
booming overhead. Not long afterwards the father <lb/>
was captured by an armed band; and while the son <lb/>
begged and pleaded, the victim was strung up before <lb/>
his face. [At this point a baleful light shone in the <lb/>
youth's eyes, and he said, with the manner of one <lb/>
who talks to himself: "If I cannot be enlisted, no <lb/>
matter&#x2014;I shall find a way&#x2014;I shall find a way."] <lb/>
As soon as the father was pronounced dead, the son <lb/>
was told that if he was not out of that region within <lb/>
twenty-four hours it would go hard with him. That <lb/>
night he crept to the riverside and hid himself near a <lb/>
plantation landing. By and by the <i>Duncan F. Kenner</i> <lb/>
stopped there, and he swam out and concealed himself <lb/>
in the yawl that was dragging at her stern. Before <lb/>
daylight the boat reached the Stock Landing and he <lb/>
slipped ashore. He walked three miles which lay be- <lb/>
tween that point and the house of an uncle of his in <lb/>
Good-Children street, in New Orleans, and then his <lb/>
<pb n="269"/>
troubles were over for the time being. But this uncle <lb/>
was a Union man, too, and before very long he con- <lb/>
cluded that he had better leave the South. So he and <lb/>
young Wicklow slipped out of the country on board a <lb/>
sailing vessel, and in due time reached New York. <lb/>
They put up at the Astor House. Young Wicklow <lb/>
had a good time of it for a while, strolling up and <lb/>
down Broadway, and observing the strange Northern <lb/>
sights; but in the end a change came&#x2014;and not for <lb/>
the better. The uncle had been cheerful at first, but <lb/>
now he began to look troubled and despondent; more- <lb/>
over, he became moody and irritable; talked of money <lb/>
giving out, and no way to get more&#x2014;"not enough <lb/>
left for one, let alone two." Then, one morning, he <lb/>
was missing&#x2014;did not come to breakfast. The boy <lb/>
inquired at the office, and was told that the uncle had <lb/>
paid his bill the night before and gone away&#x2014;to <lb/>
Boston, the clerk believed, but was not certain.</p>
<p>The lad was alone and friendless. He did not know <lb/>
what to do, but concluded he had better try to follow <lb/>
and find his uncle. He went down to the steamboat <lb/>
landing: learned that the trifle of money in his pocket <lb/>
would not carry him to Boston; however, it would <lb/>
carry him to New London; so he took passage for <lb/>
that port, resolving to trust to Providence to furnish <lb/>
him means to travel the rest of the way. He had now <lb/>
been wandering about the streets of New London three <lb/>
days and nights, getting a bite and a nap here and <lb/>
there for charity's sake. But he had given up at last; <lb/>
courage and hope were both gone. If he could enlist, <lb/>
nobody could be more thankful; if he could not get in <lb/>
as a soldier, couldn't he be a drummer boy? Ah, he <lb/>
would work <i>so</i> hard to please, and would be so grateful!</p>
<p>Well, there's the history of young Wicklow, just as <lb/>
he told it to me, barring details. I said:</p>
<p>"My boy, you are among friends now&#x2014;don't you <lb/>
<pb n="270"/>
be troubled any more." How his eyes glistened! I <lb/>
called in Sergeant John Rayburn&#x2014;he was from Hart- <lb/>
ford; lives in Hartford yet; maybe you know him&#x2014; <lb/>
and said, "Rayburn, quarter this boy with the musi- <lb/>
cians. I am going to enroll him as a drummer boy, <lb/>
and I want you to look after him and see that he is <lb/>
well treated."</p>
<p>Well, of course, intercourse between the commandant <lb/>
of the post and the drummer boy came to an end now; <lb/>
but the poor little friendless chap lay heavy on my <lb/>
heart just the same. I kept on the lookout, hoping to <lb/>
see him brighten up and begin to be cheery and gay; <lb/>
but no, the days went by, and there was no change. <lb/>
He associated with nobody; he was always absent- <lb/>
minded, always thinking; his face was always sad. <lb/>
One morning Rayburn asked leave to speak to me <lb/>
privately. Said he:</p>
<p>"I hope I don't offend, sir; but the truth is, the <lb/>
musicians are in such a sweat it seems as if somebody's <lb/>
<i>got</i> to speak."</p>
<p>"Why, what is the trouble?"</p>
<p>"It's the Wicklow boy, sir. The musicians are <lb/>
down on him to an extent you can't imagine."</p>
<p>"Well, go on, go on. What has he been doing?"</p>
<p>"Prayin', sir."</p>
<p>"Praying!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; the musicians haven't any peace of their <lb/>
life for that boy's prayin'. First thing in the morning <lb/>
he's at it; noons he's at it; and nights&#x2014;well, <i>nights</i> <lb/>
he just lays into 'em like all possessed! Sleep? Bless <lb/>
you, they <i>can't</i> sleep: he's got the floor, as the sayin' <lb/>
is, and then when he once gets his supplication-mill <lb/>
agoin' there just simply ain't any let-up <i>to</i> him. He <lb/>
starts in with the band master, and he prays for him; <lb/>
next he takes the head bugler, and he prays for <lb/>
him; next the bass drum, and he scoops <i>him</i> in; and <lb/>
<pb n="271"/>
so on, right straight through the band, givin' them all <lb/>
a show, and takin' that amount of interest in it which <lb/>
would make you think he thought he warn't but a little <lb/>
while for this world, and believed he couldn't be happy <lb/>
in heaven without he had a brass band along, and <lb/>
wanted to pick 'em out for himself, so he could depend <lb/>
on 'em to do up the national tunes in a style suitin' to <lb/>
the place. Well, sir, heavin' boots at him don't have <lb/>
no effect; it's dark in there; and, besides, he don't <lb/>
pray fair, anyway, but kneels down behind the big <lb/>
drum; so it don't make no difference if they <i>rain</i> <lb/>
boots at him, <i>he</i> don't give a dern&#x2014;warbles right <lb/>
along, same as if it was applause. They sing out, <lb/>
'Oh, dry up!' 'Give us a rest!' 'Shoot him!' <lb/>
'Oh, take a walk!' and all sorts of such things. But <lb/>
what of it? It don't phase him. <i>He</i> don't mind it." <lb/>
After a pause: "Kind of a good little fool, too; gits <lb/>
up in the mornin' and carts all that stock of boots <lb/>
back, and sorts 'em out and sets each man's pair <lb/>
where they belong. And they've been throwed at him <lb/>
so much now that he knows every boot in the band&#x2014; <lb/>
can sort 'em out with his eyes shut."</p>
<p>After another pause, which I forbore to interrupt:</p>
<p>"But the roughest thing about it is that when he's <lb/>
done prayin'&#x2014;when he ever <i>does</i> get done&#x2014;he pipes <lb/>
up and begins to <i>sing</i>. Well, you know what a honey <lb/>
kind of a voice he's got when he talks; you know how <lb/>
it would persuade a cast-iron dog to come down off of <lb/>
a doorstep and lick his hand. Now if you'll take my <lb/>
word for it, sir, it ain't a circumstance to his singin'! <lb/>
Flute music is harsh to that boy's singin'. Oh, he <lb/>
just gurgles it out so soft and sweet and low, there in <lb/>
the dark, that it makes you think you are in heaven."</p>
<p>"What is there 'rough' about that?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that's just it, sir. You hear him sing <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Just as I am&#x2014;poor, wretched, blind'&#x2014;</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="272"/>
just you hear him sing that once, and see if you don't <lb/>
melt all up and the water come into your eyes! I <lb/>
don't care <i>what</i> he sings, it goes plum straight home <lb/>
to you&#x2014;it goes deep down to where you <i>live</i>&#x2014;and <lb/>
it fetches you every time! Just you hear him sing <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Child of sin and sorrow, filled with dismay,</l>
<l>Wait not till to-morrow, yield thee to-day;</l>
<l rend="indent">Grieve not that love</l>
<l rend="indent">Which, from above'&#x2014;</l>
</lg></q>
and so on. It makes a body feel like the wickedest, <lb/>
ungratefulest brute that walks. And when he sings <lb/>
them songs of his about home, and mother, and child- <lb/>
hood, and old memories, and things that's vanished, <lb/>
and old friends dead and gone, it fetches everything <lb/>
before your face that you've ever loved and lost in all <lb/>
your life&#x2014;and it's just beautiful, it's just divine to <lb/>
listen to, sir&#x2014;but, Lord, Lord, the heart-break of it! <lb/>
The band&#x2014;well, they all cry&#x2014;every rascal of them <lb/>
blubbers, and don't try to hide it, either; and first you <lb/>
know, that very gang that's been slammin' boots at <lb/>
that boy will skip out of their bunks all of a sudden, <lb/>
and rush over in the dark and hug him! Yes, they <lb/>
do&#x2014;and slobber all over him, and call him pet names, <lb/>
and beg him to forgive them. And just at that time, <lb/>
if a regiment was to offer to hurt a hair of that cub's <lb/>
head, they'd go for that regiment, if it was a whole <lb/>
army corps!"</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>"Is that all?" said I.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, dear me, what is the complaint? What do <lb/>
they want done?"</p>
<p>"Done? Why, bless you, sir, they want you to <lb/>
stop him from <i>singin</i>'."</p>
<p>"What an idea! You said his music was divine."</p>
<pb n="273"/>
<p>"That's just it. It's <i>too</i> divine. Mortal man can't <lb/>
stand it. It stirs a body up so; it turns a body inside <lb/>
out; it racks his feelin's all to rags; it makes him feel <lb/>
bad and wicked, and not fit for any place but perdition. <lb/>
It keeps a body in such an everlastin' state of repentin', <lb/>
that nothin' don't taste good and there ain't no com- <lb/>
fort in life. And then the <i>cryin</i>', you see&#x2014;every <lb/>
mornin' they are ashamed to look one another in the <lb/>
face."</p>
<p>"Well, this is an odd case, and a singular complaint. <lb/>
So they really want the singing stopped?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, that is the idea. They don't wish to ask <lb/>
too much; they would like powerful well to have the <lb/>
prayin' shut down on, or leastways trimmed off around <lb/>
the edges; but the main thing's the singin'. If they <lb/>
can only get the singin' choked off, they think they can <lb/>
stand the prayin', rough as it is to be bullyragged so <lb/>
much that way."</p>
<p>I told the sergeant I would take the matter under <lb/>
consideration. That night I crept into the musicians' <lb/>
quarters and listened. The sergeant had not over- <lb/>
stated the case. I heard the praying voice pleading in <lb/>
the dark; I heard the execrations of the harassed men; <lb/>
I heard the rain of boots whiz through the air, and <lb/>
bang and thump around the big drum. The thing <lb/>
touched me, but it amused me, too. By and by, after <lb/>
an impressive silence, came the singing. Lord, the <lb/>
pathos of it, the enchantment of it! Nothing in the <lb/>
world was ever so sweet, so gracious, so tender, so <lb/>
holy, so moving. I made my stay very brief; I was <lb/>
beginning to experience emotions of a sort not proper <lb/>
to the commandant of a fortress.</p>
<p>Next day I issued orders which stopped the praying <lb/>
and singing. Then followed three or four days which <lb/>
were so full of bounty-jumping excitements and irrita- <lb/>
tions that I never once thought of my drummer boy. <lb/>
<pb n="274"/>
But now comes Sergeant Rayburn, one morning, and <lb/>
says:</p>
<p>"That new boy acts mighty strange, sir."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Well, sir, he's all the time writing."</p>
<p>"Writing? What does he write&#x2014;letters?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, sir; but whenever he's off duty, he <lb/>
is always poking and nosing around the fort, all by <lb/>
himself&#x2014;blest if I think there's a hole or corner in it <lb/>
he hasn't been into&#x2014;and every little while he outs <lb/>
with pencil and paper and scribbles something down."</p>
<p>This gave me a most unpleasant sensation. I wanted <lb/>
to scoff at it, but it was not a time to scoff at <i>anything</i> <lb/>
that had the least suspicious tinge about it. Things <lb/>
were happening all around us, in the North, then, that <lb/>
warned us to be always on the alert, and always sus- <lb/>
pecting. I recalled to mind the suggestive fact that <lb/>
this boy was from the South&#x2014;the extreme South, <lb/>
Louisiana&#x2014;and the thought was not of a reassuring <lb/>
nature, under the circumstances. Nevertheless, it cost <lb/>
me a pang to give the orders which I now gave to <lb/>
Rayburn. I felt like a father who plots to expose his <lb/>
own child to shame and injury. I told Rayburn to <lb/>
keep quiet, bide his time, and get me some of those <lb/>
writings whenever he could manage it without the boy's <lb/>
finding it out. And I charged him not to do anything <lb/>
which might let the boy discover that he was being <lb/>
watched. I also ordered that he allow the lad his usual <lb/>
liberties, but that he be followed at a distance when he <lb/>
went out into the town.</p>
<p>During the next two days Rayburn reported to me <lb/>
several times. No success. The boy was still writing, <lb/>
but he always pocketed his paper with a careless air <lb/>
whenever Rayburn appeared in the vicinity. He had <lb/>
gone twice to an old deserted stable in the town, re- <lb/>
mained a minute or two, and come out again. One <lb/>
<pb n="275"/>
could not pooh-pooh these things&#x2014;they had an evil <lb/>
look. I was obliged to confess to myself that I was <lb/>
getting uneasy. I went into my private quarters and <lb/>
sent for my second in command&#x2014;an officer of intelli- <lb/>
gence and judgment, son of General James Watson <lb/>
Webb. He was surprised and troubled. We had a <lb/>
long talk over the matter, and came to the conclusion <lb/>
that it would be worth while to institute a secret search. <lb/>
I determined to take charge of that myself. So I had <lb/>
myself called at two in the morning; and, pretty soon <lb/>
after, I was in the musicians' quarters, crawling along <lb/>
the floor on my stomach among the snorers. I reached <lb/>
my slumbering waif's bunk at last, without disturbing <lb/>
anybody, captured his clothes and kit, and crawled <lb/>
stealthily back again. When I got to my own quar- <lb/>
ters, I found Webb there, waiting and eager to know <lb/>
the result. We made search immediately. The clothes <lb/>
were a disappointment. In the pockets we found blank <lb/>
paper and a pencil; nothing else, except a jackknife <lb/>
and such queer odds and ends and useless trifles as <lb/>
boys hoard and value. We turned to the kit hope- <lb/>
fully. Nothing there but a rebuke for us!&#x2014;a little <lb/>
Bible with this written on the fly-leaf: "Stranger, be <lb/>
kind to my boy, for his mother's sake."</p>
<p>I looked at Webb&#x2014;he dropped his eyes; he looked <lb/>
at me&#x2014;I dropped mine. Neither spoke. I put the <lb/>
book reverently back in its place. Presently Webb <lb/>
got up and went away, without remark. After a little <lb/>
I nerved myself up to my unpalatable job, and took <lb/>
the plunder back to where it belonged, crawling on my <lb/>
stomach as before. It seemed the peculiarly appro- <lb/>
priate attitude for the business I was in.</p>
<p>I was most honestly glad when it was over and done <lb/>
with.</p>
<p>About noon next day Rayburn came, as usual, to <lb/>
report. I cut him short. I said:</p>
<pb n="276"/>
<p>"Let this nonsense be dropped. We are making a <lb/>
bugaboo out of a poor little cub who has got no more <lb/>
harm in him than a hymn-book."</p>
<p>The sergeant looked surprised, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, you know it was your orders, sir, and I've <lb/>
got some of the writing."</p>
<p>"And what does it amount to? How did you get <lb/>
it?"</p>
<p>"I peeped through the key-hole, and see him <lb/>
writing. So, when I judged he was about done, I <lb/>
made a sort of a little cough, and I see him crumple it <lb/>
up and throw it in the fire, and look all around to see <lb/>
if anybody was coming. Then he settled back as com- <lb/>
fortable and careless as anything. Then I comes in, <lb/>
and passes the time of day pleasantly, and sends him <lb/>
of an errand. He never looked uneasy, but went right <lb/>
along. It was a coal fire and new built; the writing <lb/>
had gone over behind a chunk, out of sight; but I got <lb/>
it out; there it is; it ain't hardly scorched, you see."</p>
<p>I glanced at the paper and took in a sentence or <lb/>
two. Then I dismissed the sergeant and told him to <lb/>
send Webb to me. Here is the paper in full:</p>
<quotedLetter>
<opener>
<dateline><name type="place">"<smcap>Fort Trumbull,</smcap></name><date value="00-00-08">the 8th.</date></dateline>
</opener>
<p>"<smcap>Colonel</smcap>,&#x2014;I was mistaken as to the calibre of the three guns I ended <lb/>
my list with. They are 18-pounders; all the rest of the armament is as I <lb/>
stated. The garrison remains as before reported, except that the two light <lb/>
infantry companies that were to be detached for service at the front are to <lb/>
stay here for the present&#x2014;can't find out for how long, just now, but will <lb/>
soon. We are satisfied that, all things considered, matters had better be <lb/>
postponed un&#x2014;"</p>
</quotedLetter>
<p>There it broke off&#x2014;there is where Rayburn coughed <lb/>
and interrupted the writer. All my affection for the <lb/>
boy, all my respect for him and charity for his forlorn <lb/>
condition, withered in a moment under the blight of <lb/>
this revelation of cold-blooded baseness.</p>
<pb n="277"/>
<p>But never mind about that. Here was business&#x2014; <lb/>
business that required profound and immediate atten- <lb/>
tion, too. Webb and I turned the subject over and <lb/>
over, and examined it all around. Webb said:</p>
<p>"What a pity he was interrupted! Something is <lb/>
going to be postponed until&#x2014;when? And what <i>is</i> <lb/>
the something? Possibly he would have mentioned it, <lb/>
the pious little reptile!"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "we have missed a trick. And <lb/>
who is '<i>we</i>' in the letter? Is it conspirators inside <lb/>
the fort or outside?"</p>
<p>That "we" was uncomfortably suggestive. How- <lb/>
ever, it was not worth while to be guessing around <lb/>
that, so we proceeded to matters more practical. In <lb/>
the first place, we decided to double the sentries and <lb/>
keep the strictest possible watch. Next, we thought <lb/>
of calling Wicklow in and making him divulge every- <lb/>
thing; but that did not seem wisest until other methods <lb/>
should fail. We must have some more of the writings; <lb/>
so we began to plan to that end. And now we had an <lb/>
idea: Wicklow never went to the post-office&#x2014;perhaps <lb/>
the deserted stable was his post-office. We sent for <lb/>
my confidential clerk&#x2014;a young German named Sterne, <lb/>
who was a sort of natural detective&#x2014;and told him all <lb/>
about the case, and ordered him to go to work on it. <lb/>
Within the hour we got word that Wicklow was writing <lb/>
again. Shortly afterwards word came that he had <lb/>
asked leave to go out into the town. He was detained <lb/>
a while, and meantime Sterne hurried off and concealed <lb/>
himself in the stable. By and by he saw Wicklow <lb/>
saunter in, look about him, then hide something under <lb/>
some rubbish in a corner, and take leisurely leave <lb/>
again. Sterne pounced upon the hidden article&#x2014;a <lb/>
letter&#x2014;and brought it to us. It had no superscrip- <lb/>
tion and no signature. It repeated what we had <lb/>
already read, and then went on to say: <lb/>
<pb n="278"/>
<q>"We think it best to postpone till the two companies are gone. I mean <lb/>
the four inside think so; have not communicated with the others&#x2014;afraid <lb/>
of attracting attention. I say four because we have lost two; they had <lb/>
hardly enlisted and got inside when they were shipped off to the front. It <lb/>
will be absolutely necessary to have two in their places. The two that went <lb/>
were the brothers from Thirty-mile Point. I have something of the greatest <lb/>
importance to reveal, but must not trust it to this method of communica- <lb/>
tion; will try the other."</q></p>
<p>"The little scoundrel!" said Webb; "who <i>could</i> <lb/>
have supposed he was a spy? However, never mind <lb/>
about that; let us add up our particulars, such as they <lb/>
are, and see how the case stands to date. First, we've <lb/>
got a rebel spy in our midst, whom we know; secondly, <lb/>
we've got three more in our midst whom we don't <lb/>
know; thirdly, these spies have been introduced among <lb/>
us through the simple and easy process of enlisting as <lb/>
soldiers in the Union army&#x2014;and evidently two of <lb/>
them have got sold at it, and been shipped off to the <lb/>
front; fourthly, there are assistant spies 'outside'&#x2014; <lb/>
number indefinite; fifthly, Wicklow has very important <lb/>
matter which he is afraid to communicate by the <lb/>
'present method'&#x2014;will 'try the other.' That is the <lb/>
case, as it now stands. Shall we collar Wicklow and <lb/>
make him confess? Or shall we catch the person who <lb/>
removes the letters from the stable and make <i>him</i> tell? <lb/>
Or shall we keep still and find out more?"</p>
<p>We decided upon the last course. We judged that <lb/>
we did not need to proceed to summary measures now, <lb/>
since it was evident that the conspirators were likely to <lb/>
wait till those two light infantry companies were out of <lb/>
the way. We fortified Sterne with pretty ample <lb/>
powers, and told him to use his best endeavors to <lb/>
find out Wicklow's "other method" of communica- <lb/>
tion. We meant to play a bold game; and to this end <lb/>
we proposed to keep the spies in an unsuspecting state <lb/>
as long as possible. So we ordered Sterne to return <lb/>
<pb n="279"/>
to the stable immediately, and, if he found the coast <lb/>
clear, to conceal Wicklow's letter where it was before, <lb/>
and leave it there for the conspirators to get.</p>
<p>The night closed down without further event. It <lb/>
was cold and dark and sleety, with a raw wind blowing; <lb/>
still I turned out of my warm bed several times during <lb/>
the night, and went the rounds in person, to see that <lb/>
all was right and that every sentry was on the alert. I <lb/>
always found them wide awake and watchful; evidently <lb/>
whispers of mysterious dangers had been floating <lb/>
about, and the doubling of the guards had been a kind <lb/>
of indorsement of those rumors. Once towards morn- <lb/>
ing, I encountered Webb, breasting his way against the <lb/>
bitter wind, and learned then that he, also, had been <lb/>
the rounds several times to see that all was going <lb/>
right.</p>
<p>Next day's events hurried things up somewhat. <lb/>
Wicklow wrote another letter; Sterne preceded him to <lb/>
the stable and saw him deposit it; captured it as soon <lb/>
as Wicklow was out of the way, then slipped out and <lb/>
followed the little spy at a distance, with a detective in <lb/>
plain clothes at his own heels, for we thought it judi- <lb/>
cious to have the law's assistance handy in case of <lb/>
need. Wicklow went to the railway station, and waited <lb/>
around till the train from New York came in, then <lb/>
stood scanning the faces of the crowd as they poured <lb/>
out of the cars. Presently an aged gentleman, with <lb/>
green goggles and a cane, came limping along, stopped <lb/>
in Wicklow's neighborhood, and began to look about <lb/>
him expectantly. In an instant Wicklow darted for- <lb/>
ward, thrust an envelope into his hand, then glided <lb/>
away and disappeared in the throng. The next instant <lb/>
Sterne had snatched the letter; and as he hurried past <lb/>
the detective, he said: "Follow the old gentleman&#x2014; <lb/>
don't lose sight of him." Then Sterne skurried out <lb/>
with the crowd, and came straight to the fort.</p>
<pb n="280"/>
<p>We sat with closed doors, and instructed the guard <lb/>
outside to allow no interruption.</p>
<p>First we opened the letter captured at the stable. It <lb/>
read as follows: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>Holy Alliance</smcap>,&#x2014;Found, in the usual gun, commands from the <lb/>
Master, left there last night, which set aside the instructions heretofore <lb/>
received from the subordinate quarter. Have left in the gun the usual <lb/>
indication that the commands reached the proper hand&#x2014;"</q></p>
<p>Webb, interrupting: "Isn't the boy under constant <lb/>
surveillance now?"</p>
<p>I said yes; he had been under strict surveillance <lb/>
ever since the capturing of his former letter.</p>
<p>"Then how could he put anything into a gun, or <lb/>
take anything out of it, and not get caught?"</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "I don't like the look of that very <lb/>
well."</p>
<p>"I don't, either," said Webb. "It simply means <lb/>
that there are conspirators among the very sentinels. <lb/>
Without their connivance in some way or other, the <lb/>
thing couldn't have been done."</p>
<p>I sent for Rayburn, and ordered him to examine the <lb/>
batteries and see what he could find. The reading of <lb/>
the letter was then resumed: <lb/>
<q>"The new commands are peremptory, and require that the MMMM <lb/>
shall be FFFFF at 3 o'clock to-morrow morning. Two hundred will <lb/>
arrive, in small parties, by train and otherwise, from various directions, and <lb/>
will be at appointed place at right time. I will distribute the sign to-day. <lb/>
Success is apparently sure, though something must have got out, for the <lb/>
sentries have been doubled, and the chiefs went the rounds last night several <lb/>
times. W. W. comes from southerly to-day and will receive secret orders <lb/>
&#x2014;by the other method. All six of you must be in 166 at sharp 2 <smcap>a. m.</smcap> <lb/>
You will find B. B. there, who will give you detailed instructions. Pass- <lb/>
word same as last time, only reversed&#x2014;put first syllable last and last <lb/>
syllable first. <smcap>Remember</smcap> XXXX. Do not forget. Be of good heart; <lb/>
before the next sun rises you will be heroes; your fame will be permanent; <lb/>
you will have added a deathless page to history. <smcap>Amen</smcap>."</q></p>
<pb n="281"/>
<p>"Thunder and Mars," said Webb, "but we are <lb/>
getting into mighty hot quarters, as I look at it!"</p>
<p>I said there was no question but that things were <lb/>
beginning to wear a most serious aspect. Said I:</p>
<p>"A desperate enterprise is on foot, that is plain <lb/>
enough. To-night is the time set for it&#x2014;that, also, <lb/>
is plain. The exact nature of the enterprise&#x2014;I mean <lb/>
the manner of it&#x2014;is hidden away under those blind <lb/>
bunches of M's and F's, but the end and aim, I judge, <lb/>
is the surprise and capture of the post. We must <lb/>
move quick and sharp now. I think nothing can be <lb/>
gained by continuing our clandestine policy as regards <lb/>
Wicklow. We <i>must</i> know, and as soon as possible, <lb/>
too, where '166' is located, so that we can make a <lb/>
descent upon the gang there at 2 <smcap>a. m.</smcap>; and doubtless <lb/>
the quickest way to get that information will be to <lb/>
force it out of that boy. But first of all, and before <lb/>
we make any important move, I must lay the facts <lb/>
before the War Department, and ask for plenary <lb/>
powers."</p>
<p>The dispatch was prepared in cipher to go over the <lb/>
wires; I read it, approved it, and sent it along.</p>
<p>We presently finished discussing the letter which was <lb/>
under consideration, and then opened the one which <lb/>
had been snatched from the lame gentleman. It con- <lb/>
tained nothing but a couple of perfectly blank sheets <lb/>
of note paper! It was a chilly check to our hot eager- <lb/>
ness and expectancy. We felt as blank as the paper, <lb/>
for a moment, and twice as foolish. But it was for a <lb/>
moment only; for, of course, we immediately after- <lb/>
wards thought of "sympathetic ink." We held the <lb/>
paper close to the fire and watched for the characters <lb/>
to come out, under the influence of the heat; but <lb/>
nothing appeared but some faint tracings, which we <lb/>
could make nothing of. We then called in the surgeon, <lb/>
and sent him off with orders to apply every test he was <lb/>
<pb n="282"/>
acquainted with till he got the right one, and report <lb/>
the contents of the letter to me the instant he brought <lb/>
them to the surface. This check was a confounded <lb/>
annoyance, and we naturally chafed under the delay; <lb/>
for we had fully expected to get out of that letter some <lb/>
of the most important secrets of the plot.</p>
<p>Now appeared Sergeant Rayburn, and drew from <lb/>
his pocket a piece of twine string about a foot long, <lb/>
with three knots tied in it, and held it up.</p>
<p>"I got it out of a gun on the water-front," said he. <lb/>
"I took the tompions out of all the guns and examined <lb/>
close; this string was the only thing that was in any <lb/>
gun."</p>
<p>So this bit of string was Wicklow's "sign" to sig- <lb/>
nify that the "Master's" commands had not mis- <lb/>
carried. I ordered that every sentinel who had served <lb/>
near that gun during the past twenty-four hours be put <lb/>
in confinement at once and separately, and not allowed <lb/>
to communicate with any one without my privity and <lb/>
consent.</p>
<p>A telegram now came from the Secretary of War. <lb/>
It read as follows: <lb/>
<q>"Suspend <i>habeas corpus</i>. Put town under martial law. Make neces- <lb/>
sary arrests. Act with vigor and promptness. Keep the Department <lb/>
informed."</q></p>
<p>We were now in shape to go to work. I sent out <lb/>
and had the lame gentleman quietly arrested and as <lb/>
quietly brought into the fort; I placed him under <lb/>
guard, and forbade speech to him or from him. He was <lb/>
inclined to bluster at first, but he soon dropped that.</p>
<p>Next came word that Wicklow had been seen to give <lb/>
something to a couple of our new recruits; and that, <lb/>
as soon as his back was turned, these had been seized <lb/>
and confined. Upon each was found a small bit of <lb/>
paper, bearing these words and signs in pencil: <lb/>
<pb n="283"/>
<q><smcap>Eagle's Third Flight</smcap>.</q>
<q><smcap>Remember xxxx</smcap>.</q>
<q>166.</q></p>
<p>In accordance with instructions, I telegraphed to the <lb/>
Department, in cipher, the progress made, and also <lb/>
described the above ticket. We seemed to be in a <lb/>
strong enough position now to venture to throw off the <lb/>
mask as regarded Wicklow; so I sent for him. I also <lb/>
sent for and received back the letter written in sympa- <lb/>
thetic ink, the surgeon accompanying it with the infor- <lb/>
mation that thus far it had resisted his tests, but that <lb/>
there were others he could apply when I should be <lb/>
ready for him to do so.</p>
<p>Presently Wicklow entered. He had a somewhat <lb/>
worn and anxious look, but he was composed and <lb/>
easy, and if he suspected anything it did not appear in <lb/>
his face or manner. I allowed him to stand there a <lb/>
moment or two; then I said, pleasantly:</p>
<p>"My boy, why do you go to that old stable so <lb/>
much?"</p>
<p>He answered, with simple demeanor and without <lb/>
embarrassment:</p>
<p>"Well, I hardly know, sir; there isn't any particu- <lb/>
lar reason, except that I like to be alone, and I amuse <lb/>
myself there."</p>
<p>"You amuse yourself there, do you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," he replied, as innocently and simply as <lb/>
before.</p>
<p>"Is that all you do there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," he said, looking up with childlike <lb/>
wonderment in his big, soft eyes.</p>
<pb n="284"/>
<p>"You are <i>sure?</i>"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, sure."</p>
<p>After a pause I said:</p>
<p>"Wicklow, why do you write so much?"</p>
<p>"I? I do not write much, sir."</p>
<p>"You don't?"</p>
<p>"No, sir. Oh, if you mean scribbling, I <i>do</i> scribble <lb/>
some, for amusement."</p>
<p>"What do you do with your scribblings?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, sir&#x2014;throw them away."</p>
<p>"Never send them to anybody?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>I suddenly thrust before him the letter to the <lb/>
"Colonel." He started slightly, but immediately <lb/>
composed himself. A slight tinge spread itself over <lb/>
his cheek.</p>
<p>"How came you to send <i>this</i> piece of scribbling, <lb/>
then?"</p>
<p>"I nev&#x2014;never meant any harm, sir!"</p>
<p>"Never meant any harm! You betray the armament <lb/>
and condition of the post, and mean no harm by it?"</p>
<p>He hung his head and was silent.</p>
<p>'Come, speak up, and stop lying. Whom was this <lb/>
letter intended for?"</p>
<p>He showed signs of distress now; but quickly col- <lb/>
lected himself, and replied, in a tone of deep earnest- <lb/>
ness:</p>
<p>"I will tell you the truth, sir&#x2014;the whole truth. <lb/>
The letter was never intended for anybody at all. I <lb/>
wrote it only to amuse myself. I see the error and <lb/>
foolishness of it now; but it is the only offense, sir, <lb/>
upon my honor."</p>
<p>"Ah, I am glad of that. It is dangerous to be <lb/>
writing such letters. I hope you are sure this is the <lb/>
only one you wrote?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, perfectly sure."</p>
<pb n="285"/>
<p>His hardihood was stupefying. He told that lie <lb/>
with as sincere a countenance as any creature ever <lb/>
wore. I waited a moment to soothe down my rising <lb/>
temper, and then said:</p>
<p>"Wicklow, jog your memory now, and see if you <lb/>
can help me with two or three little matters which I <lb/>
wish to inquire about."</p>
<p>"I will do my very best, sir."</p>
<p>"Then, to begin with&#x2014;who is 'the Master?'"</p>
<p>It betrayed him into darting a startled glance at our <lb/>
faces, but that was all. He was serene again in a <lb/>
moment, and tranquilly answered:</p>
<p>"I do not know, sir."</p>
<p>"You do not know?"</p>
<p>"I do not know."</p>
<p>"You are <i>sure</i> you do not know?"</p>
<p>He tried hard to keep his eyes on mine, but the <lb/>
strain was too great; his chin sunk slowly towards his <lb/>
breast and he was silent; he stood there nervously <lb/>
fumbling with a button, an object to command one's <lb/>
pity, in spite of his base acts. Presently I broke the <lb/>
stillness with the question:</p>
<p>"Who are the 'Holy Alliance'?"</p>
<p>His body shook visibly, and he made a slight random <lb/>
gesture with his hands, which to me was like the appeal <lb/>
of a despairing creature for compassion. But he made <lb/>
no sound. He continued to stand with his face bent <lb/>
towards the ground. As we sat gazing at him, waiting <lb/>
for him to speak, we saw the big tears begin to roll <lb/>
down his cheeks. But he remained silent. After a <lb/>
little, I said:</p>
<p>"You must answer me, my boy, and you must tell <lb/>
me the truth. Who are the Holy Alliance?"</p>
<p>He wept on in silence. Presently I said, somewhat <lb/>
sharply:</p>
<p>"Answer the question!"</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>He struggled to get command of his voice; and <lb/>
then, looking up appealingly, forced the words out <lb/>
between his sobs:</p>
<p>"Oh, have pity on me, sir! I cannot answer it, <lb/>
for I do not know."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir, I am telling the truth. I never have <lb/>
heard of the Holy Alliance till this moment. On my <lb/>
honor, sir, this is so."</p>
<p>"Good heavens! Look at this second letter of <lb/>
yours; there, do you see those words, '<i>Holy Alliance'?</i> <lb/>
What do you say now?"</p>
<p>He gazed up into my face with the hurt look of one <lb/>
upon whom a great wrong had been wrought, then <lb/>
said, feelingly:</p>
<p>"This is some cruel joke, sir; and how could they <lb/>
play it upon me, who have tried all I could to do right, <lb/>
and have never done harm to anybody? Some one has <lb/>
counterfeited my hand; I never wrote a line of this; I <lb/>
have never seen this letter before!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you unspeakable liar! Here, what do you <lb/>
say to <i>this?</i>"&#x2014;and I snatched the sympathetic-ink <lb/>
letter from my pocket and thrust it before his eyes.</p>
<p>His face turned white!&#x2014;as white as a dead per- <lb/>
son's. He wavered slightly in his tracks, and put his <lb/>
hand against the wall to steady himself. After a mo- <lb/>
ment he asked, in so faint a voice that it was hardly <lb/>
audible:</p>
<p>"Have you&#x2014;read it?"</p>
<p>Our faces must have answered the truth before my <lb/>
lips could get out a false "yes," for I distinctly saw <lb/>
the courage come back into that boy's eyes. I waited <lb/>
for him to say something, but he kept silent. So at <lb/>
last I said:</p>
<p>"Well, what have you to say as to the revelations <lb/>
in this letter?"</p>
<pb n="287"/>
<p>He answered, with perfect composure:</p>
<p>"Nothing, except that they are entirely harmless <lb/>
and innocent; they can hurt nobody."</p>
<p>I was in something of a corner now, as I couldn't <lb/>
disprove his assertion. I did not know exactly how to <lb/>
proceed. However, an idea came to my relief, and I <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"You are sure you know nothing about the Master <lb/>
and the Holy Alliance, and did not write the letter <lb/>
which you say is a forgery?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir&#x2014;sure."</p>
<p>I slowly drew out the knotted twine string and held <lb/>
it up without speaking. He gazed at it indifferently, <lb/>
then looked at me inquiringly. My patience was sorely <lb/>
taxed. However, I kept my temper down, and said, <lb/>
in my usual voice:</p>
<p>"Wicklow, do you see this?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"It seems to be a piece of string."</p>
<p>"<i>Seems?</i> It <i>is</i> a piece of string. Do you recog- <lb/>
nize it?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," he replied, as calmly as the words could <lb/>
be uttered.</p>
<p>His coolness was perfectly wonderful! I paused <lb/>
now for several seconds, in order that the silence might <lb/>
add impressiveness to what I was about to say; then I <lb/>
rose and laid my hand on his shoulder, and said, <lb/>
gravely:</p>
<p>"It will do you no good, poor boy, none in the <lb/>
world. This sign to the 'Master,' this knotted string, <lb/>
found in one of the guns on the water front&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Found <i>in</i> the gun! Oh, no, no, no! do not say <lb/>
<i>in</i> the gun, but in a crack in the tompion!&#x2014;it <i>must</i> <lb/>
have been in the crack!" and down he went on his <lb/>
knees and clasped his hands and lifted up a face that <lb/>
<pb n="288"/>
was pitiful to see, so ashy it was, and wild with terror.</p>
<p>"No, it was <i>in</i> the gun."</p>
<p>"Oh, something has gone wrong! My God, I am <lb/>
lost!" and he sprang up and darted this way and <lb/>
that, dodging the hands that were put out to catch <lb/>
him, and doing his best to escape from the place. But <lb/>
of course escape was impossible. Then he flung him- <lb/>
self on his knees again, crying with all his might, and <lb/>
clasped me around the legs; and so he clung to me <lb/>
and begged and pleaded, saying, "Oh, have pity on <lb/>
me! Oh, be merciful to me! Do not betray me; <lb/>
they would not spare my life a moment! Protect me, <lb/>
save me. I will confess everything!"</p>
<p>It took us some time to quiet him down and modify <lb/>
his fright, and get him into something like a rational <lb/>
frame of mind. Then I began to question him, he <lb/>
answering humbly, with downcast eyes, and from time <lb/>
to time swabbing away his constantly flowing tears:</p>
<p>"So you are at heart a rebel?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"And a spy?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"And have been acting under distinct orders from <lb/>
outside?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Willingly?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"<i>Gladly</i>, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; it would do no good to deny it. The <lb/>
South is my country; my heart is Southern, and it is <lb/>
all in her cause."</p>
<p>"Then the tale you told me of your wrongs and the <lb/>
persecution of your family was made up for the occa- <lb/>
sion?"</p>
<p>"They&#x2014;they told me to say it, sir."</p>
<p>"And you would betray and destroy those who <lb/>
<pb n="289"/>
pitied and sheltered you. Do you comprehend how <lb/>
base you are, you poor misguided thing?"</p>
<p>He replied with sobs only.</p>
<p>"Well, let that pass. To business. Who is the <lb/>
'Colonel,' and where is he?"</p>
<p>He began to cry hard, and tried to beg off from <lb/>
answering. He said he would be killed if he told. I <lb/>
threatened to put him in the dark cell and lock him up <lb/>
if he did not come out with the information. At the <lb/>
same time I promised to protect him from all harm if <lb/>
he made a clean breast. For all answer, he closed his <lb/>
mouth firmly and put on a stubborn air which I could <lb/>
not bring him out of. At last I started with him; but <lb/>
a single glance into the dark cell converted him. He <lb/>
broke into a passion of weeping and supplicating, and <lb/>
declared he would tell everything.</p>
<p>So I brought him back, and he named the <lb/>
"Colonel," and described him particularly. Said he <lb/>
would be found at the principal hotel in the town, in <lb/>
citizen's dress. I had to threaten him again, before <lb/>
he would describe and name the "Master." Said the <lb/>
Master would be found at No. 15 Bond street, New <lb/>
York, passing under the name of R. F. Gaylord. I <lb/>
telegraphed name and description to the chief of police <lb/>
of the metropolis, and asked that Gaylord be arrested <lb/>
and held till I could send for him.</p>
<p>"Now," said I, "it seems that there are several of <lb/>
the conspirators 'outside,' presumably in New London. <lb/>
Name and describe them."</p>
<p>He named and described three men and two women <lb/>
&#x2014;all stopping at the principal hotel. I sent out <lb/>
quietly, and had them and the "Colonel" arrested <lb/>
and confined in the fort.</p>
<p>"Next, I want to know all about your three fellow- <lb/>
conspirators who are here in the fort."</p>
<p>He was about to dodge me with a falsehood, I <lb/>
<pb n="290"/>
thought; but I produced the mysterious bits of paper <lb/>
which had been found upon two of them, and this had <lb/>
a salutary effect upon him. I said we had possession <lb/>
of two of the men, and he must point out the third. <lb/>
This frightened him badly, and he cried out:</p>
<p>"Oh, please don't make me; he would kill me on <lb/>
the spot!"</p>
<p>I said that that was all nonsense; I would have <lb/>
somebody near by to protect him, and, besides, the <lb/>
men should be assembled without arms. I ordered all <lb/>
the raw recruits to be mustered, and then the poor, <lb/>
trembling little wretch went out and stepped along <lb/>
down the line, trying to look as indifferent as possible. <lb/>
Finally he spoke a single word to one of the men, and <lb/>
before he had gone five steps the man was under <lb/>
arrest.</p>
<p>As soon as Wicklow was with us again, I had those <lb/>
three men brought in. I made one of them stand for- <lb/>
ward, and said:</p>
<p>"Now Wicklow, mind, not a shade's divergence <lb/>
from the exact truth. Who is this man, and what do <lb/>
you know about him?"</p>
<p>Being "in for it," he cast consequences aside, <lb/>
fastened his eyes on the man's face, and spoke straight <lb/>
along without hesitation&#x2014;to the following effect:</p>
<p>"His real name is George Bristow. He is from <lb/>
New Orleans; was second mate of the coast-packet <lb/>
<i>Capitol</i> two years ago; is a desperate character, and <lb/>
has served two terms for manslaughter&#x2014;one for kill- <lb/>
ing a deck-hand named Hyde with a capstan bar, and <lb/>
one for killing a roustabout for refusing to heave the <lb/>
lead, which is no part of a roustabout's business. He <lb/>
is a spy, and was sent here by the Colonel to act in <lb/>
that capacity. He was third mate of the <i>St. Nicholas</i> <lb/>
when she blew up in the neighborhood of Memphis, in <lb/>
'58, and came near being lynched for robbing the dead <lb/>
<pb n="291"/>
and wounded while they were being taken ashore in <lb/>
an empty wood-boat."</p>
<p>And so forth and so on&#x2014;he gave the man's biog- <lb/>
raphy in full. When he had finished, I said to the <lb/>
man:</p>
<p>"What have you to say to this?"</p>
<p>"Barring your presence, sir, it is the infernalist lie <lb/>
that ever was spoke!"</p>
<p>I sent him back into confinement, and called the <lb/>
others forward in turn. Same result. The boy gave <lb/>
a detailed history of each, without ever hesitating for a <lb/>
word or a fact; but all I could get out of either rascal <lb/>
was the indignant assertion that it was all a lie. They <lb/>
would confess nothing. I returned them to captivity, <lb/>
and brought out the rest of my prisoners, one by one. <lb/>
Wicklow told all about them&#x2014;what towns in the <lb/>
South they were from, and every detail of their con- <lb/>
nection with the conspiracy.</p>
<p>But they all denied his facts, and not one of them <lb/>
confessed a thing. The men raged, the women cried. <lb/>
According to their stories, they were all innocent <lb/>
people from out West, and loved the Union above all <lb/>
things in this world. I locked the gang up, in disgust, <lb/>
and fell to catechising Wicklow once more.</p>
<p>"Where is No. 166, and who is B. B.?"</p>
<p>But <i>there</i> he was determined to draw the line. <lb/>
Neither coaxing nor threats had any effect upon him. <lb/>
Time was flying&#x2014;it was necessary to institute sharp <lb/>
measures. So I tied him up a-tiptoe by the thumbs. <lb/>
As the pain increased, it wrung screams from him <lb/>
which were almost more than I could bear. But I held <lb/>
my ground, and pretty soon he shrieked out:</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> let me down, and I will tell!"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;you'll tell <i>before</i> I let you down."</p>
<p>Every instant was agony to him now, so out it <lb/>
came:</p>
<pb n="292"/>
<p>"No. 166, Eagle Hotel!"&#x2014;naming a wretched <lb/>
tavern down by the water, a resort of common labor- <lb/>
ers, 'longshoremen, and less reputable folk.</p>
<p>So I released him, and then demanded to know the <lb/>
object of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>"To take the fort to-night," said he, doggedly and <lb/>
sobbing.</p>
<p>"Have I got all the chiefs of the conspiracy?"</p>
<p>"No. You've got all except those that are to meet <lb/>
at 166."</p>
<p>"What does 'Remember XXXX' mean?"</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>"What is the password to No. 166?"</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>"What do those bunches of letters mean&#x2014;'FFFFF' <lb/>
and 'MMMM'? Answer! or you will catch it again."</p>
<p>"I never <i>will</i> answer! I will die first. Now do <lb/>
what you please."</p>
<p>"Think what you are saying, Wicklow. Is it final?"</p>
<p>He answered steadily, and without a quiver in his <lb/>
voice:</p>
<p>"It is final. As sure as I love my wronged country <lb/>
and hate everything this Northern sun shines on, I will <lb/>
die before I will reveal those things."</p>
<p>I tied him up by the thumbs again. When the <lb/>
agony was full upon him it was heart-breaking to hear <lb/>
the poor thing's shrieks, but we got nothing else out of <lb/>
him. To every question he screamed the same reply: <lb/>
"I can die, and I <i>will</i> die; but I will never tell."</p>
<p>Well, we had to give it up. We were convinced <lb/>
that he certainly would die rather than confess. So we <lb/>
took him down, and imprisoned him under strict guard.</p>
<p>Then for some hours we busied ourselves with send- <lb/>
ing telegrams to the War Department, and with making <lb/>
preparations for a descent upon No. 166.</p>
<p>It was stirring times, that black and bitter night. <lb/>
<pb n="293"/>
Things had leaked out, and the whole garrison was on <lb/>
the alert. The sentinels were trebled, and nobody <lb/>
could move, outside or in, without being brought to a <lb/>
stand with a musket leveled at his head. However, <lb/>
Webb and I were less concerned now than we had pre- <lb/>
viously been, because of the fact that the conspiracy <lb/>
must necessarily be in a pretty crippled condition, <lb/>
since so many of its principals were in our clutches.</p>
<p>I determined to be at No. 166 in good season, cap- <lb/>
ture and gag B. B., and be on hand for the rest when <lb/>
they arrived. At about a quarter past one in the <lb/>
morning I crept out of the fortress with half a dozen <lb/>
stalwart and gamy U. S. regulars at my heels, and the <lb/>
boy Wicklow, with his hands tied behind him. I told <lb/>
him we were going to No. 166, and that if I found he <lb/>
had lied again and was misleading us, he would have to <lb/>
show us the right place or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>We approached the tavern stealthily and recon- <lb/>
noitred. A light was burning in the small barroom, <lb/>
the rest of the house was dark. I tried the front door; <lb/>
it yielded, and we softly entered, closing the door be- <lb/>
hind us. Then we removed our shoes, and I led the <lb/>
way to the barroom. The German landlord sat there, <lb/>
asleep in his chair. I woke him gently, and told him <lb/>
to take off his boots and precede us, warning him at <lb/>
the same time to utter no sound. He obeyed without <lb/>
a murmur, but evidently he was badly frightened. I <lb/>
ordered him to lead the way to 166. We ascended <lb/>
two or three flights of stairs as softly as a file of cats; <lb/>
and then, having arrived near the farther end of a long <lb/>
hall, we came to a door through the glazed transom <lb/>
of which we could discern the glow of a dim light from <lb/>
within. The landlord felt for me in the dark and <lb/>
whispered me that that was 166. I tried the door&#x2014;it <lb/>
was locked on the inside. I whispered an order to <lb/>
one of my biggest soldiers; we set our ample shoulders <lb/>
<pb n="294"/>
to the door, and with one heave we burst it from its <lb/>
hinges. I caught a half-glimpse of a figure in a bed&#x2014; <lb/>
saw its head dart towards the candle; out went the <lb/>
light and we were in pitch darkness. With one big <lb/>
bound I lit on that bed and pinned its occupant down <lb/>
with my knees. My prisoner struggled fiercely, but I <lb/>
got a grip on his throat with my left hand, and that <lb/>
was a good assistance to my knees in holding him <lb/>
down. Then straightway I snatched out my revolver, <lb/>
cocked it, and laid the cold barrel warningly against his <lb/>
cheek.</p>
<p>"Now somebody strike a light!" said I. "I've <lb/>
got him safe."</p>
<p>It was done. The flame of the match burst up. I <lb/>
looked at my captive, and, by George, it was a young <lb/>
woman!</p>
<p>I let go and got off the bed, feeling pretty sheepish. <lb/>
Everybody stared stupidly at his neighbor. Nobody <lb/>
had any wit or sense left, so sudden and overwhelming <lb/>
had been the surprise. The young woman began to <lb/>
cry, and covered her face with the sheet. The land- <lb/>
lord said, meekly:</p>
<p>"My daughter, she has been doing something that <lb/>
is not right, <i>nicht wahr?</i>"</p>
<p>"Your daughter? Is she your daughter?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, she is my daughter. She is just to-night <lb/>
come home from Cincinnati a little bit sick."</p>
<p>"Confound it, that boy has lied again. This is not <lb/>
the right 166; this is not B. B. Now, Wicklow, you <lb/>
will find the correct 166 for us, or&#x2014;hello! where is <lb/>
that boy?"</p>
<p>Gone, as sure as guns! And, what is more, we <lb/>
failed to find a trace of him. Here was an awful pre- <lb/>
dicament. I cursed my stupidity in not tying him to <lb/>
one of the men; but it was of no use to bother about <lb/>
that now. What should I do in the present circum- <lb/>
<pb n="295"/>
stances?&#x2014;that was the question. That girl <i>might</i> be <lb/>
B. B., after all. I did not believe it, but still it would <lb/>
not answer to take unbelief for proof. So I finally <lb/>
put my men in a vacant room across the hall from 166, <lb/>
and told them to capture anybody and everybody that <lb/>
approached the girl's room, and to keep the landlord <lb/>
with them, and under strict watch, until further orders. <lb/>
Then I hurried back to the fort to see if all was right <lb/>
there yet.</p>
<p>Yes, all was right. And all remained right. I <lb/>
stayed up all night to make sure of that. Nothing <lb/>
happened. I was unspeakably glad to see the dawn <lb/>
come again, and be able to telegraph the Department <lb/>
that the Stars and Stripes still floated over Fort Trum- <lb/>
bull.</p>
<p>An immense pressure was lifted from my breast. <lb/>
Still I did not relax vigilance, of course, nor effort, <lb/>
either; the case was too grave for that. I had up my <lb/>
prisoners, one by one, and harried them by the hour, <lb/>
trying to get them to confess, but it was a failure. <lb/>
They only gnashed their teeth and tore their hair, and <lb/>
revealed nothing.</p>
<p>About noon came tidings of my missing boy. He <lb/>
had been seen on the road, tramping westward, some <lb/>
eight miles out, at six in the morning. I started a <lb/>
cavalry lieutenant and a private on his track at once. <lb/>
They came in sight of him twenty miles out. He had <lb/>
climbed a fence and was wearily dragging himself <lb/>
across a slushy field towards a large old-fashioned <lb/>
mansion in the edge of a village. They rode through <lb/>
a bit of woods, made a detour, and closed upon the <lb/>
house from the opposite side; then dismounted and <lb/>
skurried into the kitchen. Nobody there. They <lb/>
slipped into the next room, which was also unoccu- <lb/>
pied; the door from that room into the front or sitting <lb/>
room was open. They were about to step through it <lb/>
<pb n="296"/>
when they heard a low voice; it was somebody pray- <lb/>
ing. So they halted reverently, and the lieutenant put <lb/>
his head in and saw an old man and an old woman <lb/>
kneeling in a corner of that sitting-room. It was the <lb/>
old man that was praying, and just as he was finishing <lb/>
his prayer, the Wicklow boy opened the front door <lb/>
and stepped in. Both of those old people sprang at <lb/>
him and smothered him with embraces, shouting:</p>
<p>"Our boy! our darling! God be praised. The <lb/>
lost is found! He that was dead is alive again!"</p>
<p>Well, sir, what do you think! That young imp was <lb/>
born and reared on that homestead, and had never <lb/>
been five miles away from it in all his life till the fort- <lb/>
night before he loafed into my quarters and gulled me <lb/>
with that maudlin yarn of his! It's as true as gospel. <lb/>
That old man was his father&#x2014;a learned old retired <lb/>
clergyman; and that old lady was his mother.</p>
<p>Let me throw in a word or two of explanation con- <lb/>
cerning that boy and his performances. It turned <lb/>
out that he was a ravenous devourer of dime novels <lb/>
and sensation-story papers&#x2014;therefore, dark myster- <lb/>
ies and gaudy heroisms were just in his line. Then he <lb/>
had read newspaper reports of the stealthy goings and <lb/>
comings of rebel spies in our midst, and of their lurid <lb/>
purposes and their two or three startling achievements, <lb/>
till his imagination was all aflame on that subject. His <lb/>
constant comrade for some months had been a Yankee <lb/>
youth of much tongue and lively fancy, who had served <lb/>
for a couple of years as "mud clerk" (that is, subor- <lb/>
dinate purser) on certain of the packet-boats plying <lb/>
between New Orleans and points two or three hundred <lb/>
miles up the Mississippi&#x2014;hence his easy facility in <lb/>
handling the names and other details pertaining to that <lb/>
region. Now I had spent two or three months in <lb/>
that part of the country before the war; and I knew <lb/>
just enough about it to be easily taken in by that <lb/>
<pb n="297"/>
boy, whereas a born Louisianian would probably have <lb/>
caught him tripping before he had talked fifteen min- <lb/>
utes. Do you know the reason he said he would rather <lb/>
die than explain certain of his treasonable enigmas? <lb/>
Simply because he <i>couldn't</i> explain them!&#x2014;they had <lb/>
no meaning; he had fired them out of his imagination <lb/>
without forethought or afterthought; and so, upon <lb/>
sudden call, he wasn't able to invent an explanation of <lb/>
them. For instance, he couldn't reveal what was hid- <lb/>
den in the "sympathetic ink" letter, for the ample <lb/>
reason that there wasn't anything hidden in it; it was <lb/>
blank paper only. He hadn't put anything into a gun, <lb/>
and had never intended to&#x2014;for his letters were all <lb/>
written to imaginary persons, and when he hid one in <lb/>
the stable he always removed the one he had put there <lb/>
the day before; so he was not acquainted with that <lb/>
knotted string, since he was seeing it for the first time <lb/>
when I showed it to him; but as soon as I had let him <lb/>
find out where it came from, he straightway adopted <lb/>
it, in his romantic fashion, and got some fine effects <lb/>
out of it. He invented Mr. "Gaylord"; there wasn't <lb/>
any 15 Bond street, just then&#x2014;it had been pulled <lb/>
down three months before. He invented the "Col- <lb/>
onel"; he invented the glib histories of those unfor- <lb/>
tunates whom I captured and confronted with him; he <lb/>
invented "B. B."; he even invented No. 166, one <lb/>
may say, for he didn't know there <i>was</i> such a number <lb/>
in the Eagle Hotel until we went there. He stood <lb/>
ready to invent anybody or anything whenever it was <lb/>
wanted. If I called for "outside" spies, he promptly <lb/>
described strangers whom he had seen at the hotel, and <lb/>
whose names he had happened to hear. Ah, he lived <lb/>
in a gorgeous, mysterious, romantic world during those <lb/>
few stirring days, and I think it was <i>real</i> to him, and <lb/>
that he enjoyed it clear down to the bottom of his <lb/>
heart.</p>
<pb n="298"/>
<p>But he made trouble enough for us, and just no end <lb/>
of humiliation. You see, on account of him we had <lb/>
fifteen or twenty people under arrest and confinement <lb/>
in the fort, with sentinels before their doors. A lot of <lb/>
the captives were soldiers and such, and to them I <lb/>
didn't have to apologize; but the rest were first-class <lb/>
citizens, from all over the country, and no amount of <lb/>
apologies was sufficient to satisfy them. They just <lb/>
fumed and raged and made no end of trouble! And <lb/>
those two ladies&#x2014;one was an Ohio Congressman's <lb/>
wife, the other a Western bishop's sister&#x2014;well, the <lb/>
scorn and ridicule and angry tears they poured out on <lb/>
me made up a keepsake that was likely to make me <lb/>
remember them for a considerable time&#x2014;and I shall. <lb/>
That old lame gentleman with the goggles was a college <lb/>
president from Philadelphia, who had come up to <lb/>
attend his nephew's funeral. He had never seen young <lb/>
Wicklow before, of course. Well, he not only missed <lb/>
the funeral, and got jailed as a rebel spy, but Wicklow <lb/>
had stood up there in my quarters and coldly described <lb/>
him as a counterfeiter, nigger-trader, horse-thief, and <lb/>
firebug from the most notorious rascal-nest in Galves- <lb/>
ton; and this was a thing which that poor old gentle- <lb/>
man couldn't seem to get over at all.</p>
<p>And the War Department! But, oh, my soul, let's <lb/>
draw the curtain over that part!</p>
<q><smcap>Note</smcap>.&#x2014;I showed my manuscript to the Major, and he said: "Your <lb/>
unfamiliarity with military matters has betrayed you into some little mis- <lb/>
takes. Still, they are picturesque ones&#x2014;let them go; military men will <lb/>
smile at them, the rest won't detect them. You have got the main facts of <lb/>
the history right, and have set them down just about as they occurred."&#x2014;M. T.</q>

<head><b>MRS. McWILLIAMS AND THE LIGHTNING</b></head>
<p><smcap>Well</smcap>, sir&#x2014;continued Mr. McWilliams, for this <lb/>
was not the beginning of his talk&#x2014;the fear of <lb/>
lightning is one of the most distressing infirmities a <lb/>
human being can be afflicted with. It is mostly con- <lb/>
fined to women; but now and then you find it in a <lb/>
little dog, and sometimes in a man. It is a particularly <lb/>
distressing infirmity, for the reason that it takes the <lb/>
sand out of a person to an extent which no other fear <lb/>
can, and it can't be <i>reasoned</i> with, and neither can it be <lb/>
shamed out of a person. A woman who could face <lb/>
the very devil himself&#x2014;or a mouse&#x2014;loses her grip <lb/>
and goes all to pieces in front of a flash of lightning. <lb/>
Her fright is something pitiful to see.</p>
<p>Well, as I was telling you, I woke up, with that <lb/>
smothered and unlocatable cry of "Mortimer! Morti- <lb/>
mer!" wailing in my ears; and as soon as I could <lb/>
scrape my faculties together I reached over in the dark <lb/>
and then said:</p>
<p>"Evangeline, is that you calling? What is the <lb/>
matter? Where are you?"</p>
<p>"Shut up in the boot-closet. You ought to be <lb/>
ashamed to lie there and sleep so, and such an awful <lb/>
storm going on."</p>
<p>"Why, how <i>can</i> one be ashamed when he is alseep? <lb/>
It is unreasonable; a man <i>can't</i> be ashamed when he <lb/>
is asleep, Evangeline."</p>
<p>"You never try, Mortimer&#x2014;you know very well <lb/>
you never try."</p>
<pb n="300"/>
<p>I caught the sound of muffled sobs.</p>
<p>That sound smote dead the sharp speech that was on <lb/>
my lips, and I changed it to&#x2014;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, dear&#x2014;I'm truly sorry. I never meant <lb/>
to act so. Come back and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<smcap>Mortimer</smcap>!"</p>
<p>"Heavens! what is the matter, my love?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say you are in that bed yet?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course."</p>
<p>"Come out of it instantly. I should think you <lb/>
would take some <i>little</i> care of your life, for <i>my</i> sake <lb/>
and the children's, if you will not for your own."</p>
<p>"But, my love&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Don't talk to me, Mortimer. You <i>know</i> there is <lb/>
no place so dangerous as a bed, in such a thunder- <lb/>
storm as this&#x2014;all the books say that; yet there you <lb/>
would lie, and deliberately throw away your life&#x2014;for <lb/>
goodness knows what, unless for the sake of arguing, <lb/>
and arguing, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But, confound it, Evangeline, I'm <i>not</i> in the bed <lb/>
<i>now</i>. I'm&#x2014;"</p>
<p>[Sentence interrupted by a sudden glare of lightning, <lb/>
followed by a terrified little scream from Mrs. Mc- <lb/>
Williams and a tremendous blast of thunder.]</p>
<p>"There! You see the result. O, Mortimer, how <lb/>
<i>can</i> you be so profligate as to swear at such a time as <lb/>
this?"</p>
<p>"I <i>didn't</i> swear. And that <i>wasn't</i> a result of it, <lb/>
anyway. It would have come, just the same, if I <lb/>
hadn't said a word; and you know very well, Evan- <lb/>
geline&#x2014;at least, you ought to know&#x2014;that when the <lb/>
atmosphere is charged with electricity&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; now argue it, and argue it, and argue <lb/>
it!&#x2014;I don't see how you can act so, when you <i>know</i> <lb/>
there is not a lightning-rod on the place, and your <lb/>
poor wife and children are absolutely at the mercy of <lb/>
<pb n="301"/>
Providence. What <i>are</i> you doing?&#x2014;lighting a match <lb/>
at such a time as this! Are you stark mad?"</p>
<p>"Hang it, woman, where's the harm? The place is <lb/>
as dark as the inside of an infidel, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Put it out! put it out instantly! Are you deter- <lb/>
mined to sacrifice us all? You <i>know</i> there is nothing <lb/>
attracts lightning like a light. [<i>Fzt!&#x2014;crash! boom <lb/>
&#x2014;boloom-boom-boom!</i>] Oh, just hear it! Now you <lb/>
see what you've done!"</p>
<p>"No, I <i>don't</i> see what I've done. A match may <lb/>
attract lightning, for all I know, but it don't <i>cause</i> <lb/>
lightning&#x2014;I'll go odds on that. And it didn't attract <lb/>
it worth a cent this time; for if that shot was leveled <lb/>
at my match, it was blessed poor markmanship&#x2014; <lb/>
about an average of none out of a possible million, I <lb/>
should say. Why, at Dollymount such marksmanship <lb/>
as that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"For shame, Mortimer! Here we are standing right <lb/>
in the very presence of death, and yet in so solemn <lb/>
a moment you are capable of using such language <lb/>
as that. If you have no desire to&#x2014;Mortimer!"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Did you say your prayers to-night?"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;I&#x2014;meant to, but I got to trying to cipher <lb/>
out how much twelve times thirteen is, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>[<i>Fzt!&#x2014;boom-berroom-boom! bumble-umble bang-</i> <lb/>
<smcap>smash</smcap>!]</p>
<p>"Oh, we are lost, beyond all help! How <i>could</i> <lb/>
you neglect such a thing at such a time as this?"</p>
<p>"But it <i>wasn't</i> 'such a time as this.' There wasn't <lb/>
a cloud in the sky. How could <i>I</i> know there was <lb/>
going to be all this rumpus and pow-wow about a little <lb/>
slip like that? And I don't think it's just fair for you <lb/>
to make so much out of it, anyway, seeing it happens <lb/>
so seldom; I haven't missed before since I brought on <lb/>
that earthquake, four years ago."</p>
<pb n="302"/>
<p>"<smcap>Mortimer</smcap>! How you talk! Have you forgotten <lb/>
the yellow-fever?"</p>
<p>"My dear, you are always throwing up the yellow- <lb/>
fever to me, and I think it is perfectly unreasonable. <lb/>
You can't even send a telegraphic message as far as <lb/>
Memphis without relays, so how is a little devotional <lb/>
slip of mine going to carry so far? I'll <i>stand</i> the <lb/>
earthquake, because it was in the neighborhood; but <lb/>
I'll be hanged if I'm going to be responsible for every <lb/>
blamed&#x2014;"</p>
<p>[<i>Fzt!</i>&#x2014;<smcap>boom</smcap> <i>beroor</i>-boom! boom.&#x2014;BANG!]</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, dear, dear! I <i>know</i> it struck something, <lb/>
Mortimer. We never shall see the light of another <lb/>
day; and if it will do you any good to remember, <lb/>
when we are gone, that your dreadful language&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>Mortimer!</i>"</p>
<p>"<smcap>Well</smcap>! What now?"</p>
<p>"Your voice sounds as if&#x2014;Mortimer, are you <lb/>
actually standing in front of that open fireplace?"</p>
<p>"That is the very crime I am committing."</p>
<p>"Get away from it this moment! You do seem <lb/>
determined to bring destruction on us all. Don't you <lb/>
<i>know</i> that there is no better conductor for lightning <lb/>
than an open chimney? <i>Now</i> where have you got to?"</p>
<p>"I'm here by the window."</p>
<p>"Oh, for pity's sake! have you lost your mind? <lb/>
Clear out from there, this moment! The very children <lb/>
in arms know it is fatal to stand near a window in a <lb/>
thunder-storm. Dear, dear, I know I shall never see <lb/>
the light of another day! Mortimer!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What is that rustling?"</p>
<p>"It's me."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Trying to find the upper end of my pantaloons."</p>
<p>"Quick! throw those things away! I do believe <lb/>
<pb n="303"/>
you would deliberately put on those clothes at such a <lb/>
time as this; yet you know perfectly well that <i>all</i> <lb/>
authorities agree that woolen stuffs attract lightning. <lb/>
Oh, dear, dear, it isn't sufficient that one's life must <lb/>
be in peril from natural causes, but you must do every- <lb/>
thing you can possibly think of to augment the danger. <lb/>
Oh, <i>don't</i> sing! What <i>can</i> you be thinking of?"</p>
<p>"Now where's the harm in it?"</p>
<p>"Mortimer, if I have told you once, I have told you <lb/>
a hundred times, that singing causes vibrations in the <lb/>
atmosphere which interrupt the flow of the electric <lb/>
fluid, and&#x2014;What on <i>earth</i> are you opening that <lb/>
door for?"</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious, woman, is there any harm in <lb/>
<i>that?</i>"</p>
<p>"<i>Harm?</i> There's <i>death</i> in it. Anybody that has <lb/>
given this subject any attention knows that to create a <lb/>
draught is to invite the lightning. You haven't half <lb/>
shut it; shut it <i>tight</i>&#x2014;and do hurry, or we are all <lb/>
destroyed. Oh, it is an awful thing to be shut up with <lb/>
a lunatic at such a time as this. Mortimer, what <i>are</i> <lb/>
you doing?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Just turning on the water. This room <lb/>
is smothering hot and close. I want to bathe my face <lb/>
and hands."</p>
<p>"You have certainly parted with the remnant of <lb/>
your mind! Where lightning strikes any other sub- <lb/>
stance once, it strikes water fifty times. Do turn it <lb/>
off. Oh, dear, I am sure that nothing in this world <lb/>
can save us. It does seem to me that&#x2014;Mortimer, <lb/>
what was that?"</p>
<p>"It was a da&#x2014;it was a picture. Knocked it <lb/>
down."</p>
<p>"Then you are close to the wall! I never heard of <lb/>
such imprudence! Don't you <i>know</i> that there's no <lb/>
better conductor for lightning than a wall? Come <lb/>
<pb n="304"/>
away from there! And you came as near as anything <lb/>
to swearing, too. Oh, how can you be so desperately <lb/>
wicked, and your family in such peril? Mortimer, did <lb/>
you order a feather bed, as I asked you to do?"</p>
<p>"No. Forgot it."</p>
<p>"Forgot it! It may cost you your life. If you <lb/>
had a feather bed now, and could spread it in the <lb/>
middle of the room and lie on it, you would be per- <lb/>
fectly safe. Come in here&#x2014;come quick, before you <lb/>
have a chance to commit any more frantic indiscre- <lb/>
tions."</p>
<p>I tried, but the little closet would not hold us both <lb/>
with the door shut, unless we could be content to <lb/>
smother. I gasped awhile, then forced my way out. <lb/>
My wife called out:</p>
<p>"Mortimer, something <i>must</i> be done for your <lb/>
preservation. Give me that German book that is on <lb/>
the end of the mantel-piece, and a candle; but don't <lb/>
light it; give me a match; I will light it in here. That <lb/>
book has some directions in it."</p>
<p>I got the book&#x2014;at cost of a vase and some other <lb/>
brittle things; and the madam shut herself up with her <lb/>
candle. I had a moment's peace; then she called out:</p>
<p>"Mortimer, what was that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing but the cat."</p>
<p>"The cat! Oh, destruction! Catch her, and shut <lb/>
her up in the washstand. Do be quick, love; cats are <lb/>
<i>full</i> of electricity. I just know my hair will turn white <lb/>
with this night's awful perils."</p>
<p>I heard the muffled sobbings again. But for that, I <lb/>
should not have moved hand or foot in such a wild <lb/>
enterprise in the dark.</p>
<p>However, I went at my task&#x2014;over chairs, and <lb/>
against all sorts of obstructions, all of them hard ones, <lb/>
too, and most of them with sharp edges&#x2014;and at last <lb/>
I got kitty cooped up in the commode, at an expense <lb/>
<pb n="305"/>
of over four hundred dollars in broken furniture and <lb/>
shins. Then these muffled words came from the closet:</p>
<p>"It says the safest thing is to stand on a chair in <lb/>
the middle of the room, Mortimer; and the legs of the <lb/>
chair must be insulated with non-conductors. That is, <lb/>
you must set the legs of the chair in glass tumblers. <lb/>
[<i>Fzt!&#x2014;boom&#x2014;bang!&#x2014;smash!</i>] Oh, hear that! <lb/>
Do hurry, Mortimer, before you are struck."</p>
<p>I managed to find and secure the tumblers. I got <lb/>
the last four&#x2014;broke all the rest. I insulated the <lb/>
chair legs, and called for further instructions.</p>
<p>"Mortimer, it says, 'W&#x00E4;hrend eines Gewitters ent- <lb/>
ferne man Metalle, wie z. B., Ringe, Uhren, Schl&#x00FC;ssel, <lb/>
etc., von sich und halte sich auch nicht an solchen <lb/>
Stellen auf, wo viele Metalle bei einander liegen, oder <lb/>
mit andern K&#x00F6;rpern verbunden sind, wie an Herden, <lb/>
Oefen, Eisengittern u. dgl.' What does that mean, <lb/>
Mortimer? Does it mean that you must keep metals <lb/>
<i>about</i> you, or keep them <i>away</i> from you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I hardly know. It appears to be a little <lb/>
mixed. All German advice is more or less mixed. <lb/>
However, I think that that sentence is mostly in the <lb/>
dative case, with a little genitive and accusative sifted <lb/>
in, here and there, for luck; so I reckon it means that <lb/>
you must keep some metals <i>about</i> you."</p>
<p>"Yes, that must be it. It stands to reason that it is. <lb/>
They are in the nature of lightning-rods, you know. <lb/>
Put on your fireman's helmet, Mortimer; that is <lb/>
mostly metal."</p>
<p>I got it, and put it on&#x2014;a very heavy and clumsy <lb/>
and uncomfortable thing on a hot night in a close <lb/>
room. Even my nightdress seemed to be more <lb/>
clothing than I strictly needed.</p>
<p>"Mortimer, I think your middle ought to be pro- <lb/>
tected. Won't you buckle on your militia saber, <lb/>
please?"</p>
<pb n="306"/>
<p>I complied.</p>
<p>"Now, Mortimer, you ought to have some way to <lb/>
protect your feet. Do please put on your spurs."</p>
<p>I did it&#x2014;in silence&#x2014;and kept my temper as well <lb/>
as I could.</p>
<p>"Mortimer, it says, 'Das Gewitter l&#x00E4;uten ist sehr <lb/>
gef&#x00E4;hrlich, weil die Glocke selbst, sowie der durch das <lb/>
L&#x00E4;uten veranlasste Luftzug und die H&#x00F6;he des Thurmes <lb/>
den Blitz anziehen k&#x00F6;nnten.' Mortimer, does that <lb/>
mean that it is dangerous not to ring the church bells <lb/>
during a thunder-storm?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it seems to mean that&#x2014;if that is the past <lb/>
participle of the nominative case singular, and I reckon <lb/>
it is. Yes, I think it means that on account of the <lb/>
height of the church tower and the absence of <i>Luftzug</i> <lb/>
it would be very dangerous (<i>sehr gef&#x00E4;hrlich</i>) not to <lb/>
ring the bells in time of a storm; and moreover, don't <lb/>
you see, the very wording&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Never mind that, Mortimer; don't waste the <lb/>
precious time in talk. Get the large dinner-bell; it is <lb/>
right there in the hall. Quick, Mortimer, dear; we <lb/>
are almost safe. Oh, dear, I do believe we are going <lb/>
to be saved, at last!"</p>
<p>Our little summer establishment stands on top of a <lb/>
high range of hills, overlooking a valley. Several farm- <lb/>
houses are in our neighborhood&#x2014;the nearest some <lb/>
three or four hundred yards away.</p>
<p>When I, mounted on the chair, had been clanging <lb/>
that dreadful bell a matter of seven or eight minutes, <lb/>
our shutters were suddenly torn open from without, <lb/>
and a brilliant bull's-eye lantern was thrust in at the <lb/>
window, followed by a hoarse inquiry:</p>
<p>"What in the nation is the matter here?"</p>
<p>The window was full of men's heads, and the heads <lb/>
were full of eyes that stared wildly at my nightdress <lb/>
and my warlike accoutrements.</p>
<pb/>
<pb/>
<p><i>"What is the matter here?"</i></p>
<pb/>
<figure/>
<pb/>
<pb n="307"/>
<p>I dropped the bell, skipped down from the chair in <lb/>
confusion, and said:</p>
<p>"There is nothing the matter, friends&#x2014;only a little <lb/>
discomfort on account of the thunder-storm. I was <lb/>
trying to keep off the lightning."</p>
<p>"Thunder-storm? Lightning? Why, Mr. McWil- <lb/>
liams, have you lost your mind? It is a beautiful <lb/>
starlight night; there has been no storm."</p>
<p>I looked out, and I was so astonished I could hardly <lb/>
speak for a while. Then I said:</p>
<p>I do not understand this. We distinctly saw the <lb/>
glow of the flashes through the curtains and shutters, <lb/>
and heard the thunder."</p>
<p>One after another of those people lay down on the <lb/>
ground to laugh&#x2014;and two of them died. One of the <lb/>
survivors remarked:</p>
<p>"Pity you didn't think to open your blinds and <lb/>
look over to the top of the high hill yonder. What <lb/>
you heard was cannon; what you saw was the flash. <lb/>
You see, the telegraph brought some news, just at <lb/>
midnight; Garfield's nominated&#x2014;and that's what's <lb/>
the matter!"</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Twain, as I was saying in the beginning <lb/>
(said Mr. McWilliams), the rules for preserving people <lb/>
against lightning are so excellent and so innumerable <lb/>
that the most incomprehensible thing in the world to <lb/>
me is how anybody ever manages to get struck.</p>
<p>So saying, he gathered up his satchel and umbrella, <lb/>
and departed; for the train had reached his town.</p>

<head><b>MEISTERSCHAFT: IN THREE ACTS</b><ref target="n2">*</ref><note id="n2" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p><smcap>Explanatory</smcap>. I regard the idea of this play as a valuable invention. <lb/>
I call it the Patent Universally-Applicable Automatically-Adjustable Lan- <lb/>
guage Drama. This indicates that it is adjustable to any tongue, and per- <lb/>
formable in any tongue. The English portions of the play are to remain <lb/>
just as they are, permanently; but you change the foreign portions to any <lb/>
language you please, at will. Do you see? You at once have the same <lb/>
old play in a new tongue. And you can keep on changing it from language <lb/>
to language, until your private theatrical pupils have become glib and at <lb/>
home in the speech of all nations. <i>Zum Beispiel</i>, suppose we wish to <lb/>
adjust the play to the French tongue. First, we give Mrs. Blumenthal and <lb/>
Gretchen French names. Next, we knock the German Meisterschaft <lb/>
sentences out of the first scene, and replace them with sentences from the <lb/>
French Meisterschaft&#x2014;like this, for instance: "Je voudrais faire des <lb/>
emplettes ce matin; voulez-vous avoir l'obligeance de venir avec moi chez <lb/>
le tailleur fran&#x00E7;ais?" And so on. Wherever you find German, replace it <lb/>
with French, leaving the English parts undisturbed. When you come to <lb/>
the long conversation in the second act, turn to any pamphlet of your <lb/>
French Meisterschaft, and shovel in as much French talk on <i>any</i> subject as <lb/>
will fill up the gaps left by the expunged German. Example&#x2014;page 423, <lb/>
French Meisterschaft: <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre"><q><lg type="group">
<l>On dirait qu'il va faire chaud.</l>
<l>J'ai chaud.</l>
<l>J'ai extr&#x00EA;mement chaud.</l>
<l>Ah! qu'il fait chaud!</l>
<l>Il fait une chaleur &#x00E9;touffante!</l>
<l>L'air est br&#x00FB;lant.</l>
<l>Je meurs de chaleur.</l>
<l>Il est presque impossible de supporter la chaleur.</l>
<l>Cela vous fait transpirer.</l>
<l>Mettons nous &#x00E0; l'ombre.</l>
<l>Il fait du vent.</l>
<l>Il fait un vent froid.</l>
<l>Il fait un temps tr&#x00E8;s-agr&#x00E9;able pour se promener aujourd'hui.</l>
</lg></q></foreign></p>
<p>And so on, all the way through. It is very easy to adjust the play to <lb/>
any desired language. Anybody can do it.]</p></note></head>

enough, to have to study this impossible German <lb/>
tongue: to be exiled from home and all human society <lb/>

abscheulich. Here's only three weeks of the three <lb/>
<pb n="309"/>
months gone and it seems like three years. I don't <lb/>
believe I can live through it, and I'm sure Annie can't. <lb/>

ciety, provided we talk German. What would such a <lb/>
conversation be like! If you should stick to Meister- <lb/>
schaft, it would change the subject every two minutes; <lb/>
and if you stuck to Ollendorff, it would be all about <lb/>
your sister's mother's good stocking of thread, or your <lb/>
grandfather's aunt's good hammer of the carpenter, <lb/>
and who's got it, and there an end. You couldn't <lb/>
keep up your interest in such topics. (<i>Memorizing: <lb/>

made up to one thing: I will be an exile, in spirit and <lb/>
in truth; I will see no one during these three months. <lb/>
Father is very ingenious&#x2014;oh, very! thinks he is, <lb/>
anyway. Thinks he has invented a way to <i>force</i> us to <lb/>
learn to speak German. He is a dear good soul, and <lb/>

he does. And I believe Will suspects that Annie cares <lb/>
for <i>him</i> a little, that I do. And I know perfectly well <lb/>
that they care for <i>us</i>. They agree with all our opin- <lb/>

prejudice, they change it, as soon as they see how <lb/>
foolish it is. Dear George! at first he just couldn't <lb/>
abide cats; but now, why now he's just all for cats; <lb/>
he fairly welters in cats. I never saw such a reform. <lb/>

<q>(Enter Mr. Stephenson.)</q>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Stephenson</smcap>.</speaker><p>Good morning, Mrs. Blumenthal&#x2014; <lb/>
keep your seat, keep your seat, please. I'm only here <lb/>
for a moment&#x2014;merely to get your report, you know. <lb/>
(<i>Seating himself</i>.) Don't want to see the girls&#x2014;poor <lb/>
things, they'd want to go home with me. I'm afraid I <lb/>
couldn't have the heart to say no. How's the German <lb/>
getting along?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>N-not very well; I was afraid you would <lb/>
ask me that. You see, they hate it, they don't take <lb/>
<pb n="316"/>
the least interest in it, and there isn't anything to <lb/>
incite them to an interest, you see. And so they can't <lb/>
talk at all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>M-m. That's bad. I had an idea that they'd <lb/>
get lonesome, and have to seek society; and then, of <lb/>
course, my plan would work, considering the cast-iron <lb/>
conditions of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>But it hasn't so far. I've thrown nice <lb/>
company in their way&#x2014;I've done my very best, in <lb/>
every way I could think of&#x2014;but it's no use; they <lb/>
won't go out, and they won't receive anybody. And <lb/>
a body can't blame them; they'd be tongue-tied&#x2014; <lb/>
couldn't do anything with a German conversation. <lb/>
Now, when I started to learn German&#x2014;such poor <lb/>
German as I know&#x2014;the case was very different; my <lb/>
intended was a German. I was to live among Germans <lb/>
the rest of my life; and so I <i>had</i> to learn. Why, <lb/>
bless my heart! I nearly <i>lost</i> the man the first time <lb/>
he asked me&#x2014;I thought he was talking about the <lb/>
measles. They were very prevalent at the time. Told <lb/>
him I didn't want any in mine. But I found out the <lb/>
mistake, and I was fixed for him next time&#x2026; &#x2026;Oh, <lb/>
yes, Mr. Stephenson, a sweetheart's a prime incentive!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S. (<i>Aside</i>.)</speaker><p>Good soul! she doesn't suspect that <lb/>
my plan is a double scheme&#x2014;includes a speaking <lb/>
knowledge of German, which I am bound they shall <lb/>
have, and the keeping them away from those two <lb/>
young fellows&#x2014;though if I had known that those boys <lb/>
were going off for a year's foreign travel, I&#x2014;however, <lb/>
the girls would never learn that language at home; <lb/>
they're here, and I won't relent&#x2014;they've got to stick <lb/>
the three months out. (<i>Aloud</i>.) So they are making <lb/>
poor progress? Now tell me&#x2014;will they learn it&#x2014; <lb/>
after a sort of fashion, I mean&#x2014;in three months?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Well, now, I'll tell you the only chance I <lb/>
see. Do what I will, they won't answer my German <lb/>
<pb n="317"/>
with anything but English; if that goes on, they'll <lb/>
stand stock still. Now I'm willing to do this: I'll <lb/>
straighten everything up, get matters in smooth run- <lb/>

sick, and stay sick three weeks.</p></sp>

servant girl&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>That's it; that's my project. She doesn't <lb/>
know a word of English. And Gretchen's a real <lb/>

tongue's just a flutter-mill. I'll keep my room&#x2014;just <lb/>
ailing a little&#x2014;and they'll never see my face except <lb/>
when they pay their little duty-visits to me, and then <lb/>
I'll say English disorders my mind. They'll be shut <lb/>

sechs Uhr nehmen sie wiederum Abschied; um halb <lb/>
acht kehren sie noche'mal zur&#x00FC;ck, und plaudern und <lb/>
schwatzen und plappern und schnattern bis zehn Uhr, <lb/>
oder vielleicht ein Viertel nach, falls ihre Uhren nach <lb/>
gehen (und stets gehen sie nach am Ende des Besuchs, <lb/>
aber stets vor Beginn desselben), und zuweilen unter- <lb/>
halten sich die jungen Leute beim Spazierengehen; und <lb/>
jeden Sonntag gehen sie dreimal in die Kirche; und <lb/>
immer plaudern sie, und schwatzen und plappern <lb/>
und schnattern bis ihnen die Z&#x00E4;hne aus dem Munde <lb/>
fallen. Und <i>ich?</i> Durch Mangel an Uebung, ist mir <lb/>
die Zunge mit Moos belegt worden! Freilich ist's mir <lb/>
eine dumme Zeit gewesen. Aber&#x2014;um Gotteswillen, <lb/>
was geht das mir an? Was soll ich daraus machen? <lb/>
T&#x00E4;glich sagt die Frau Wirthin "Gretchen" (<i>dumb- <lb/>
show of paying a piece of money into her hand</i>), "du <lb/>
bist eine der besten Sprach-Lehrerinnen der Welt!" <lb/>
Ach, Gott! Und t&#x00E4;glich sagen die edlen jungen <lb/>
M&#x00E4;nner, "Gretchen, liebes Kind" (<i>money-paying again <lb/>
in dumb-show&#x2014;three coins</i>), "bleib' taub&#x2014;blind&#x2014; <lb/>
todt!" und so bleibe ich&#x2026;&#x2026;Jetzt wird es ungef&#x00E4;hr <lb/>
neun Uhr sein; bald kommen sie vom Spaziergehen <lb/>
zur&#x00FC;ck. Also, es w&#x00E4;re gut dass ich meinem eigenen <lb/>
Schatz einen Besuch abstatte und spazieren gehe. <lb/>

<q>(Enter Wirthin. R.)</q>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>That was Mr. Stephenson's train that <lb/>
<pb n="331"/>
just came in. Evidently the girls are out walking with <lb/>
Gretchen;&#x2014;can't find <i>them</i>, and <i>she</i> doesn't seem to <lb/>

<q>(Exit. R.)</q>
<q>(Enter Stephenson and Wirthin. R.)</q>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Well, how does sickness seem to agree with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>So well that I've never been out of my <lb/>
room since, till I heard your train come in.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Thou miracle of fidelity! Now I argue from <lb/>
that, that the new plan is working.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Working? Mr. Stephenson, you never <lb/>
saw anything like it in the whole course of your life! <lb/>
It's absolutely wonderful the way it works.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Succeeds? No&#x2014;you don't mean it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Indeed, I do mean it. I tell you, Mr. <lb/>
Stephenson, that plan was just an inspiration&#x2014;that's <lb/>
what it was. You could teach a cat German by it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Dear me, this is noble news! Tell me about it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Well, it's all Gretchen&#x2014;ev-ery bit of it. <lb/>
I told you she was a jewel. And then the sagacity of <lb/>
that child&#x2014;why, I never dreamed it was in her. Sh- <lb/>
she, "Never you ask the young ladies a question&#x2014; <lb/>
never let on&#x2014;just keep mum&#x2014;leave the whole thing <lb/>
to me," sh-she.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Good! And she justified, did she?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Well, sir, the amount of German gabble <lb/>
that that child crammed into those two girls inside the <lb/>
next forty-eight hours&#x2014;well, <i>I</i> was satisfied! So I've <lb/>
never asked a question&#x2014;never <i>wanted</i> to ask any. <lb/>
I've just lain curled up there, happy. The little dears! <lb/>
they've flitted in to see me a moment, every morning <lb/>
and noon and supper-time; and as sure as I'm sitting <lb/>
here, inside of six days they were clattering German to <lb/>
me like a house afire!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Sp-lendid, splendid!</p></sp>
<pb n="332"/>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Of course it ain't grammatical&#x2014;the in- <lb/>
ventor of the language can't talk grammatical; if the <lb/>
dative didn't fetch him the accusative would; but it's <lb/>
German all the same, and don't you forget it!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Go on&#x2014;go on&#x2014;this is delicious news&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Gretchen, she says to me at the start, <lb/>
"Never you mind about company for 'em," sh-she&#x2014; <lb/>
"I'm company enough." And I says, "All right <lb/>
&#x2014;fix it your own way, child;" and that she <i>was</i> <lb/>
right is shown by the fact that to this day they don' <lb/>
care a straw for any company but hers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Dear me; why, it's admirable!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Well, I should think so! They just dote <lb/>
on that hussy&#x2014;can't seem to get enough of her. <lb/>
Gretchen tells me so herself. And the care she takes <lb/>
of them! She tells me that every time there's a moon- <lb/>
light night she coaxes them out for a walk; and if a <lb/>
body can believe her, she actually bullies them off to <lb/>
church three times every Sunday!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Why, the little dev&#x2014;missionary! Really, she's <lb/>
a genius!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>She's a bud, <i>I</i> tell you! Dear me, how <lb/>
she's brought those girls' health up! Cheeks?&#x2014;just <lb/>
roses. Gait?&#x2014;they walk on watch-springs! And <lb/>
happy?&#x2014;by the bliss in their eyes, you'd think <lb/>
they're in Paradise! Ah, that Gretchen! Just you <lb/>
imagine <i>our</i> trying to achieve these marvels!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>You're right&#x2014;every time. Those girls&#x2014;why, <lb/>
all they'd have wanted to know was what we wanted <lb/>
done, and then they wouldn't have <i>done</i> it&#x2014;the mis- <lb/>
chievous young rascals!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><smcap>Wirthin</smcap>.</speaker><p>Don't tell <i>me?</i> Bless you, I found that <lb/>
out early&#x2014;when <i>I</i> was bossing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>S.</speaker><p>Well, I'm im-mensely pleased. <i>Now</i> fetch them <lb/>
down. I'm not afraid now. They won't want to go <lb/>
home.</p></sp>

<head><b>THE &#x00A3;1,000,000 BANK-NOTE</b></head>
<p><smcap>When i</smcap> was twenty-seven years old, I was a mining- <lb/>
broker's clerk in San Francisco, and an expert in <lb/>
all the details of stock traffic. I was alone in the world, <lb/>
and had nothing to depend upon but my wits and a <lb/>
clean reputation; but these were setting my feet in the <lb/>
road to eventual fortune, and I was content with the <lb/>
prospect.</p>
<p>My time was my own after the afternoon board, <lb/>
Saturdays, and I was accustomed to put it in on a little <lb/>
sail-boat on the bay. One day I ventured too far, and <lb/>
was carried out to sea. Just at nightfall, when hope <lb/>
was about gone, I was picked up by a small brig which <lb/>
was bound for London. It was a long and stormy <lb/>
voyage, and they made me work my passage without <lb/>
pay, as a common sailor. When I stepped ashore in <lb/>
London my clothes were ragged and shabby, and I <lb/>
had only a dollar in my pocket. This money fed and <lb/>
sheltered me twenty-four hours. During the next <lb/>
twenty-four I went without food and shelter.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock on the following morning, seedy <lb/>
and hungry, I was dragging myself along Portland <lb/>
Place, when a child that was passing, towed by a <lb/>
nurse-maid, tossed a luscious big pear&#x2014;minus one <lb/>
bite&#x2014;into the gutter. I stopped, of course, and <lb/>
fastened my desiring eye on that muddy treasure. My <lb/>
mouth watered for it, my stomach craved it, my whole <lb/>
being begged for it. But every time I made a move to <lb/>
<pb n="340"/>
get it some passing eye detected my purpose, and of <lb/>
course I straightened up then, and looked indifferent, <lb/>
and pretended that I hadn't been thinking about the <lb/>
pear at all. This same thing kept happening and hap- <lb/>
pening, and I couldn't get the pear. I was just getting <lb/>
desperate enough to brave all the shame, and to seize <lb/>
it, when a window behind me was raised, and a gentle- <lb/>
man spoke out of it, saying:</p>
<p>"Step in here, please."</p>
<p>I was admitted by a gorgeous flunkey, and shown <lb/>
into a sumptuous room where a couple of elderly <lb/>
gentlemen were sitting. They sent away the servant, <lb/>
and made me sit down. They had just finished their <lb/>
breakfast, and the sight of the remains of it almost <lb/>
overpowered me. I could hardly keep my wits together <lb/>
in the presence of that food, but as I was not asked to <lb/>
sample it, I had to bear my trouble as best I could.</p>
<p>Now, something had been happening there a little <lb/>
before, which I did not know anything about until a <lb/>
good many days afterwards, but I will tell you about it <lb/>
now. Those two old brothers had been having a <lb/>
pretty hot argument a couple of days before, and had <lb/>
ended by agreeing to decide it by a bet, which is the <lb/>
English way of settling everything.</p>
<p>You will remember that the Bank of England once <lb/>
issued two notes of a million pounds each, to be used <lb/>
for a special purpose connected with some public <lb/>
transaction with a foreign country. For some reason <lb/>
or other only one of these had been used and canceled; <lb/>
the other still lay in the vaults of the Bank. Well, the <lb/>
brothers, chatting along, happened to get to wondering <lb/>
what might be the fate of a perfectly honest and intel- <lb/>
ligent stranger who should be turned adrift in London <lb/>
without a friend, and with no money but that million- <lb/>
pound bank-note, and no way to account for his being <lb/>
in possession of it. Brother A said he would starve to <lb/>
<pb n="341"/>
death; Brother B said he wouldn't. Brother A said <lb/>
he couldn't offer it at a bank or anywhere else, because <lb/>
he would be arrested on the spot. So they went on <lb/>
disputing till Brother B said he would bet twenty thou- <lb/>
sand pounds that the man would live thirty days, <lb/>
<i>anyway</i>, on that million, and keep out of jail, too. <lb/>
Brother A took him up. Brother B went down to the <lb/>
Bank and bought that note. Just like an Englishman, <lb/>
you see; pluck to the backbone. Then he dictated a <lb/>
letter, which one of his clerks wrote out in a beautiful <lb/>
round hand, and then the two brothers sat at the <lb/>
window a whole day watching for the right man to <lb/>
give it to.</p>
<p>They saw many honest faces go by that were not <lb/>
intelligent enough; many that were intelligent, but not <lb/>
honest enough; many that were both, but the posses- <lb/>
sors were not poor enough, or, if poor enough, were <lb/>
not strangers. There was always a defect, until I came <lb/>
along; but they agreed that I filled the bill all around; <lb/>
so they elected me unanimously, and there I was now <lb/>
waiting to know why I was called in. They began to <lb/>
ask me questions about myself, and pretty soon they <lb/>
had my story. Finally they told me I would answer <lb/>
their purpose. I said I was sincerely glad, and asked <lb/>
what it was. Then one of them handed me an en- <lb/>
velope, and said I would find the explanation inside. <lb/>
I was going to open it, but he said no; take it to my <lb/>
lodgings, and look it over carefully, and not be hasty <lb/>
or rash. I was puzzled, and wanted to discuss the <lb/>
matter a little further, but they didn't; so I took <lb/>
my leave, feeling hurt and insulted to be made the <lb/>
butt of what was apparently some kind of a practical <lb/>
joke, and yet obliged to put up with it, not being <lb/>
in circumstances to resent affronts from rich and strong <lb/>
folk.</p>
<p>I would have picked up the pear now and eaten it <lb/>
<pb n="342"/>
before all the world, but it was gone; so I had lost <lb/>
that by this unlucky business, and the thought of it did <lb/>
not soften my feeling towards those men. As soon as <lb/>
I was out of sight of that house I opened my envelope, <lb/>
and saw that it contained money! My opinion of <lb/>
those people changed, I can tell you! I lost not a <lb/>
moment, but shoved note and money into my vest <lb/>
pocket, and broke for the nearest cheap eating house. <lb/>
Well, how I did eat! When at last I couldn't hold <lb/>
any more, I took out my money and unfolded it, took <lb/>
one glimpse and nearly fainted. Five millions of dol- <lb/>
lars! Why, it made my head swim.</p>
<p>I must have sat there stunned and blinking at the <lb/>
note as much as a minute before I came rightly to <lb/>
myself again. The first thing I noticed, then, was the <lb/>
landlord. His eye was on the note, and he was petri- <lb/>
fied. He was worshiping, with all his body and soul, <lb/>
but he looked as if he couldn't stir hand or foot. I <lb/>
took my cue in a moment, and did the only rational <lb/>
thing there was to do. I reached the note towards <lb/>
him, and said, carelessly:</p>
<p>"Give me the change, please."</p>
<p>Then he was restored to his normal condition, and <lb/>
made a thousand apologies for not being able to break <lb/>
the bill, and I couldn't get him to touch it. He <lb/>
wanted to look at it, and keep on looking at it; he <lb/>
couldn't seem to get enough of it to quench the thirst <lb/>
of his eye, but he shrank from touching it as if it had <lb/>
been something too sacred for poor common clay to <lb/>
handle. I said:</p>
<p>"I am sorry if it is an inconvenience, but I must <lb/>
insist. Please change it; I haven't anything else."</p>
<p>But he said that wasn't any matter; he was quite <lb/>
willing to let the trifle stand over till another time. I <lb/>
said I might not be in his neighborhood again for a <lb/>
good while; but he said it was of no consequence, he</p>
<pb/>
<pb/>
<p><i>"Change please"</i></p>
<pb/>
<figure/>
<pb/>
<pb n="343"/>
<p>could wait, and, moreover, I could have anything I <lb/>
wanted, any time I chose, and let the account run as <lb/>
long as I pleased. He said he hoped he wasn't afraid <lb/>
to trust as rich a gentleman as I was, merely because I <lb/>
was of a merry disposition, and chose to play larks on <lb/>
the public in the matter of dress. By this time another <lb/>
customer was entering, and the landlord hinted to me <lb/>
to put the monster out of sight; then he bowed me <lb/>
all the way to the door, and I started straight for that <lb/>
house and those brothers, to correct the mistake which <lb/>
had been made before the police should hunt me up, <lb/>
and help me do it. I was pretty nervous; in fact, <lb/>
pretty badly frightened, though, of course, I was no <lb/>
way in fault; but I knew men well enough to know <lb/>
that when they find they've given a tramp a million- <lb/>
pound bill when they thought it was a one-pounder, <lb/>
they are in a frantic rage against <i>him</i> instead of <lb/>
quarreling with their own near-sightedness, as they <lb/>
ought. As I approached the house my excitement <lb/>
began to abate, for all was quiet there, which made <lb/>
me feel pretty sure the blunder was not discovered yet. <lb/>
I rang. The same servant appeared. I asked for <lb/>
those gentlemen.</p>
<p>"They are gone." This in the lofty, cold way of <lb/>
that fellow's tribe.</p>
<p>"Gone? Gone where?"</p>
<p>"On a journey."</p>
<p>"But whereabouts?"</p>
<p>"To the Continent, I think."</p>
<p>"The Continent?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Which way&#x2014;by what route?"</p>
<p>"I can't say, sir."</p>
<p>"When will they be back?"</p>
<p>"In a month, they said."</p>
<p>"A month! Oh, this is awful! Give me <i>some</i> sort <lb/>
<pb n="344"/>
of idea of how to get a word to them. It's of the last <lb/>
importance."</p>
<p>"I can't, indeed. I've no idea where they've gone, <lb/>
sir."</p>
<p>"Then I must see some member of the family."</p>
<p>"Family's away, too; been abroad months&#x2014;in <lb/>
Egypt and India, I think."</p>
<p>"Man, there's been an immense mistake made. <lb/>
They'll be back before night. Will you tell them I've <lb/>
been here, and that I will keep coming till it's all made <lb/>
right, and they needn't be afraid?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell them, if they come back, but I am not ex- <lb/>
pecting them. They said you would be here in an <lb/>
hour to make inquiries, but I must tell you it's all <lb/>
right, they'll be here on time and expect you."</p>
<p>So I had to give it up and go away. What a riddle <lb/>
it all was! I was like to lose my mind. They would <lb/>
be here "on time." What could that mean? Oh, <lb/>
the letter would explain, maybe. I had forgotten the <lb/>
letter; I got it out and read it. This is what it said: <lb/>
<q>"You are an intelligent and honest man, as one may see by your face. <lb/>
We conceive you to be poor and a stranger. Enclosed you will find a sum <lb/>
of money. It is lent to you for thirty days, without interest. Report at <lb/>
this house at the end of that time. I have a bet on you. If I win it you <lb/>
shall have any situation that is in my gift&#x2014;any, that is, that you shall be <lb/>
able to prove yourself familiar with and competent to fill."</q></p>
<p>No signature, no address, no date.</p>
<p>Well, here was a coil to be in! You are posted on <lb/>
what had preceded all this, but I was not. It was just <lb/>
a deep, dark puzzle to me. I hadn't the least idea <lb/>
what the game was, nor whether harm was meant me <lb/>
or a kindness. I went into a park, and sat down to <lb/>
try to think it out, and to consider what I had best do.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour my reasonings had crystallized <lb/>
into this verdict.</p>
<p>Maybe those men mean me well, maybe they mean <lb/>
<pb n="345"/>
me ill; no way to decide that&#x2014;let it go. They've <lb/>
got a game, or a scheme, or an experiment, of some <lb/>
kind on hand; no way to determine what it is&#x2014;let it <lb/>
go. There's a bet on me; no way to find out what it <lb/>
is&#x2014;let it go. That disposes of the indeterminable <lb/>
quantities; the remainder of the matter is tangible, <lb/>
solid, and may be classed and labeled with certainty. <lb/>
If I ask the Bank of England to place this bill to the <lb/>
credit of the man it belongs to, they'll do it, for they <lb/>
know him, although I don't; but they will ask me <lb/>
how I came in possession of it, and if I tell the truth, <lb/>
they'll put me in the asylum, naturally, and a lie will <lb/>
land me in jail. The same result would follow if I <lb/>
tried to bank the bill anywhere or to borrow money on <lb/>
it. I have got to carry this immense burden around <lb/>
until those men come back, whether I want to or not. <lb/>
It is useless to me, as useless as a handful of ashes, <lb/>
and yet I must take care of it, and watch over it, while <lb/>
I beg my living. I couldn't <i>give</i> it away, if I should <lb/>
try, for neither honest citizen nor highwayman would <lb/>
accept it or meddle with it for anything. Those <lb/>
brothers are safe. Even if I lose their bill, or burn it, <lb/>
they are still safe, because they can stop payment, and <lb/>
the Bank will make them whole; but meantime I've <lb/>
got to do a month's suffering without wages or profit&#x2014; <lb/>
unless I help win that bet, whatever it may be, and get <lb/>
that situation that I am promised. I <i>should</i> like to get <lb/>
that; men of their sort have situations in their gift that <lb/>
are worth having.</p>
<p>I got to thinking a good deal about that situation. <lb/>
My hopes began to rise high. Without doubt the <lb/>
salary would be large. It would begin in a month; <lb/>
after that I should be all right. Pretty soon I was feel- <lb/>
ing first-rate. By this time I was tramping the streets <lb/>
again. The sight of a tailor-shop gave me a sharp <lb/>
longing to shed my rags, and to clothe myself decently <lb/>
<pb n="346"/>
once more. Could I afford it? No; I had nothing in <lb/>
the world but a million pounds. So I forced myself <lb/>
to go on by. But soon I was drifting back again. The <lb/>
temptation persecuted me cruelly. I must have passed <lb/>
that shop back and forth six times during that manful <lb/>
struggle. At last I gave in; I had to. I asked if they <lb/>
had a misfit suit that had been thrown on their hands. <lb/>
The fellow I spoke to nodded his head towards another <lb/>
fellow, and gave me no answer. I went to the indi- <lb/>
cated fellow, and he indicated another fellow with <i>his</i> <lb/>
head, and no words. I went to him, and he said:</p>
<p>"'Tend to you presently."</p>
<p>I waited till he was done with what he was at, then <lb/>
he took me into a back room, and overhauled a pile of <lb/>
rejected suits, and selected the rattiest one for me. I <lb/>
put it on. It didn't fit, and wasn't in any way attract- <lb/>
ive, but it was new, and I was anxious to have it; so <lb/>
I didn't find any fault, but said, with some diffidence:</p>
<p>"It would be an accommodation to me if you could <lb/>
wait some days for the money. I haven't any small <lb/>
change about me."</p>
<p>The fellow worked up a most sarcastic expression of <lb/>
countenance, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, you haven't? Well, of course, I didn't ex- <lb/>
pect it. I'd only expect gentlemen like you to carry <lb/>
large change."</p>
<p>I was nettled, and said:</p>
<p>"My friend, you shouldn't judge a stranger always <lb/>
by the clothes he wears. I am quite able to pay for <lb/>
this suit; I simply didn't wish to put you to the <lb/>
trouble of changing a large note."</p>
<p>He modified his style a little at that, and said, <lb/>
though still with something of an air:</p>
<p>"I didn't mean any particular harm, but as long as <lb/>
rebukes are going, I might say it wasn't quite your <lb/>
affair to jump to the conclusion that we couldn't <lb/>
<pb n="347"/>
change any note that you might happen to be carrying <lb/>
around. On the contrary, we <i>can</i>."</p>
<p>I handed the note to him, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, very well; I apologize."</p>
<p>He received it with a smile, one of those large smiles <lb/>
which goes all around over, and has folds in it, and <lb/>
wrinkles, and spirals, and looks like the place where <lb/>
you have thrown a brick in a pond; and then in the <lb/>
act of his taking a glimpse of the bill this smile froze <lb/>
solid, and turned yellow, and looked like those wavy, <lb/>
wormy spreads of lava which you find hardened on <lb/>
little levels on the side of Vesuvius. I never before <lb/>
saw a smile caught like that, and perpetuated. The <lb/>
man stood there holding the bill, and looking like that, <lb/>
and the proprietor hustled up to see what was the <lb/>
matter, and said, briskly:</p>
<p>"Well, what's up? what's the trouble? what's <lb/>
wanting?"</p>
<p>I said: "There isn't any trouble. I'm waiting for <lb/>
my change."</p>
<p>"Come, come; get him his change, Tod; get him <lb/>
his change."</p>
<p>Tod retorted: "Get him his change! It's easy to <lb/>
say, sir; but look at the bill yourself."</p>
<p>The proprietor took a look, gave a low, eloquent <lb/>
whistle, then made a dive for the pile of rejected <lb/>
clothing, and began to snatch it this way and that, <lb/>
talking all the time excitedly, and as if to himself:</p>
<p>"Sell an eccentric millionaire such an unspeakable <lb/>
suit as that! Tod's a fool&#x2014;a born fool. Always <lb/>
doing something like this. Drives every millionaire <lb/>
away from this place, because he can't tell a millionaire <lb/>
from a tramp, and never could. Ah, here's the thing <lb/>
I am after. Please get those things off, sir, and throw <lb/>
them in the fire. Do me the favor to put on this shirt <lb/>
and this suit; it's just the thing, the very thing&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="348"/>
plain, rich, modest, and just ducally nobby; made to <lb/>
order for a foreign prince&#x2014;you may know him, sir, <lb/>
his Serene Highness the Hospodar of Halifax; had to <lb/>
leave it with us and take a mourning-suit because his <lb/>
mother was going to die&#x2014;which she didn't. But <lb/>
that's all right; we can't always have things the way <lb/>
we&#x2014;that is, the way they&#x2014;there! trousers all right, <lb/>
they fit you to a charm, sir; now the waistcoat; aha, <lb/>
right again! now the coat&#x2014;lord! look at that, now! <lb/>
Perfect&#x2014;the whole thing! I never saw such a triumph <lb/>
in all my experience."</p>
<p>I expressed my satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Quite right, sir, quite right; it'll do for a make- <lb/>
shift, I'm bound to say. But wait till you see what <lb/>
we'll get up for you on your own measure. Come, <lb/>
Tod, book and pen; get at it. Length of leg, 32"&#x2014; <lb/>
and so on. Before I could get in a word he had meas- <lb/>
ured me, and was giving orders for dress-suits, morning <lb/>
suits, shirts, and all sorts of things. When I got a <lb/>
chance I said:</p>
<p>"But, my dear sir, I <i>can't</i> give these orders, unless <lb/>
you can wait indefinitely, or change the bill."</p>
<p>"Indefinitely! It's a weak word, sir, a weak word. <lb/>
Eternally&#x2014;<i>that's</i> the word, sir. Tod, rush these <lb/>
things through, and send them to the gentleman's ad- <lb/>
dress without any waste of time. Let the minor cus- <lb/>
tomers wait. Set down the gentleman's address and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I'm changing my quarters. I will drop in and <lb/>
leave the new address."</p>
<p>"Quite right, sir, quite right. One moment&#x2014;let <lb/>
me show you out, sir. There&#x2014;good day, sir, good <lb/>
day."</p>
<p>Well, don't you see what was bound to happen? I <lb/>
drifted naturally into buying whatever I wanted, and <lb/>
asking for change. Within a week I was sumptuously <lb/>
equipped with all needful comforts and luxuries, and <lb/>
<pb n="349"/>
was housed in an expensive private hotel in Hanover <lb/>
Square. I took my dinners there, but for breakfast I <lb/>
stuck by Harris's humble feeding house, where I had <lb/>
got my first meal on my million-pound bill. I was the <lb/>
making of Harris. The fact had gone all abroad that <lb/>
the foreign crank who carried million-pound bills in his <lb/>
vest pocket was the patron saint of the place. That <lb/>
was enough. From being a poor, struggling, little <lb/>
hand-to-mouth enterprise, it had become celebrated, <lb/>
and overcrowded with customers. Harris was so grate- <lb/>
ful that he forced loans upon me, and would not be <lb/>
denied; and so, pauper as I was, I had money to <lb/>
spend, and was living like the rich and the great. I <lb/>
judged that there was going to be a crash by and by, <lb/>
but I was in now and must swim across or drown. <lb/>
You see there was just that element of impending dis- <lb/>
aster to give a serious side, a sober side, yes, a tragic <lb/>
side, to a state of things which would otherwise have <lb/>
been purely ridiculous. In the night, in the dark, the <lb/>
tragedy part was always to the front, and always warn- <lb/>
ing, always threatening; and so I moaned and tossed, <lb/>
and sleep was hard to find. But in the cheerful day- <lb/>
light the tragedy element faded out and disappeared, <lb/>
and I walked on air, and was happy to giddiness, to <lb/>
intoxication, you may say.</p>
<p>And it was natural; for I had become one of the <lb/>
notorieties of the metropolis of the world, and it turned <lb/>
my head, not just a little, but a good deal. You could <lb/>
not take up a newspaper, English, Scotch, or Irish, <lb/>
without finding in it one or more references to the <lb/>
"vest pocket million-pounder" and his latest doings <lb/>
and sayings. At first, in these mentions, I was at the <lb/>
bottom of the personal-gossip column; next, I was <lb/>
listed above the knights, next above the baronets, next <lb/>
above the barons, and so on, and so on, climbing <lb/>
steadily, as my notoriety augmented, until I reached <lb/>
<pb n="350"/>
the highest altitude possible, and there I remained, <lb/>
taking precedence of all dukes not royal, and of all <lb/>
ecclesiastics except the primate of all England. But <lb/>
mind, this was not fame; as yet I had achieved only <lb/>
notoriety. Then came the climaxing stroke&#x2014;the ac- <lb/>
colade, so to speak&#x2014;which in a single instant trans- <lb/>
muted the perishable dross of notoriety into the <lb/>
enduring gold of fame: <i>Punch</i> caricatured me! Yes, <lb/>
I was a made man now; my place was established. I <lb/>
might be joked about still, but reverently, not hilari- <lb/>
ously, not rudely; I could be smiled at, but not <lb/>
laughed at. The time for that had gone by. <i>Punch</i> <lb/>
pictured me all a-flutter with rags, dickering with a <lb/>
beef-eater for the Tower of London. Well, you can <lb/>
imagine how it was with a young fellow who had never <lb/>
been taken notice of before, and now all of a sudden <lb/>
couldn't say a thing that wasn't taken up and repeated <lb/>
everywhere; couldn't stir abroad without constantly <lb/>
overhearing the remark flying from lip to lip, "There <lb/>
he goes; that's him!" couldn't take his breakfast <lb/>
without a crowd to look on; couldn't appear in an <lb/>
opera-box without concentrating there the fire of a <lb/>
thousand lorgnettes. Why, I just swam in glory all <lb/>
day long&#x2014;that is the amount of it.</p>
<p>You know, I even kept my old suit of rags, and <lb/>
every now and then appeared in them, so as to have <lb/>
the old pleasure of buying trifles, and being insulted, <lb/>
and then shooting the scoffer dead with the million- <lb/>
pound bill. But I couldn't keep that up. The illus- <lb/>
trated papers made the outfit so familiar that when I <lb/>
went out in it I was at once recognized and followed <lb/>
by a crowd, and if I attempted a purchase the man <lb/>
would offer me his whole shop on credit before I could <lb/>
pull my note on him.</p>
<p>About the tenth day of my fame I went to fulfil my <lb/>
duty to my flag by paying my respects to the Ameri- <lb/>
<pb n="351"/>
can minister. He received me with the enthusiasm <lb/>
proper in my case, upbraided me for being so tardy in <lb/>
my duty, and said that there was only one way to get <lb/>
his forgiveness, and that was to take the seat at his <lb/>
dinner-party that night made vacant by the illness of <lb/>
one of his guests. I said I would, and we got to talk- <lb/>
ing. It turned out that he and my father had been <lb/>
schoolmates in boyhood, Yale students together later, <lb/>
and always warm friends up to my father's death. So <lb/>
then he required me to put in at his house all the odd <lb/>
time I might have to spare, and I was very willing, of <lb/>
course.</p>
<p>In fact, I was more than willing; I was glad. When <lb/>
the crash should come, he might somehow be able to <lb/>
save me from total destruction; I didn't know how, <lb/>
but he might think of a way, maybe. I couldn't <lb/>
venture to unbosom myself to him at this late date, a <lb/>
thing which I would have been quick to do in the be- <lb/>
ginning of this awful career of mine in London. No, <lb/>
I couldn't venture it now; I was in too deep; that is, <lb/>
too deep for me to be risking revelations to so new a <lb/>
friend, though not clear beyond my depth, as <i>I</i> looked <lb/>
at it. Because, you see, with all my borrowing, I was <lb/>
carefully keeping within my means&#x2014;I mean within <lb/>
my salary. Of course, I couldn't <i>know</i> what my salary <lb/>
was going to be, but I had a good enough basis for an <lb/>
estimate in the fact that, if I won the bet I was to have <lb/>
<i>choice</i> of any situation in that rich old gentleman's gift <lb/>
provided I was competent&#x2014;and I should certainly <lb/>
prove competent; I hadn't any doubt about that. <lb/>
And as to the bet, I wasn't worrying about that; I <lb/>
had always been lucky. Now my estimate of the <lb/>
salary was six hundred to a thousand a year; say, six <lb/>
hundred for the first year, and so on up year by year, <lb/>
till I struck the upper figure by proved merit. At <lb/>
present I was only in debt for my first year's salary. <lb/>
<pb n="352"/>
Everybody had been trying to lend me money, but I <lb/>
had fought off the most of them on one pretext or <lb/>
another; so this indebtedness represented only &#x00A3;300 <lb/>
borrowed money, the other &#x00A3;300 represented my keep <lb/>
and my purchases. I believed my second year's salary <lb/>
would carry me through the rest of the month if I <lb/>
went on being cautious and economical, and I intended <lb/>
to look sharply out for that. My month ended, my <lb/>
employer back from his journey, I should be all right <lb/>
once more, for I should at once divide the two years' <lb/>
salary among my creditors by assignment, and get right <lb/>
down to my work.</p>
<p>It was a lovely dinner-party of fourteen. The Duke <lb/>
and Duchess of Shoreditch, and their daughter the <lb/>
Lady Anne-Grace-Eleanor-Celeste-and-so-forth-and-so- <lb/>
forth-de-Bohun, the Earl and Countess of Newgate, <lb/>
Viscount Cheapside, Lord and Lady Blatherskite, some <lb/>
untitled people of both sexes, the minister and his wife <lb/>
and daughter, and his daughter's visiting friend, an <lb/>
English girl of twenty-two, named Portia Langham, <lb/>
whom I fell in love with in two minutes, and she with <lb/>
me&#x2014;I could see it without glasses. There was still <lb/>
another guest, an American&#x2014;but I am a little ahead <lb/>
of my story. While the people were still in the <lb/>
drawing-room, whetting up for dinner, and coldly in- <lb/>
specting the late comers, the servant announced:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lloyd Hastings."</p>
<p>The moment the usual civilities were over, Hastings <lb/>
caught sight of me, and came straight with cordially <lb/>
outstretched hand; then stopped short when about to <lb/>
shake, and said, with an embarrassed look:</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, I thought I knew you."</p>
<p>"Why, you do know me, old fellow."</p>
<p>"No. Are <i>you</i> the&#x2014;the&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Vest pocket monster? I am, indeed. Don't be <lb/>
afraid to call me by my nickname; I'm used to it."</p>
<pb n="353"/>
<p>"Well, well, well, this is a surprise. Once or twice <lb/>
I've seen your own name coupled with the nickname, <lb/>
but it never occurred to me that <i>you</i> could be the <lb/>
Henry Adams referred to. Why, it isn't six months <lb/>
since you were clerking away for Blake Hopkins in <lb/>
Frisco on a salary, and sitting up nights on an extra <lb/>
allowance, helping me arrange and verify the Gould <lb/>
and Curry Extension papers and statistics. The idea <lb/>
of your being in London, and a vast millionaire, and a <lb/>
colossal celebrity! Why, it's the Arabian Nights come <lb/>
again. Man, I can't take it in at all; can't realize it; <lb/>
give me time to settle the whirl in my head."</p>
<p>"The fact is, Lloyd, you are no worse off than I <lb/>
am. I can't realize it myself."</p>
<p>"Dear me, it <i>is</i> stunning, now isn't it? Why, it's <lb/>
just three months to-day since we went to the Miners' <lb/>
restaurant&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No; the What Cheer."</p>
<p>"Right, it <i>was</i> the What Cheer; went there at two <lb/>
in the morning, and had a chop and coffee after a hard <lb/>
six-hours grind over those Extension papers, and I <lb/>
tried to persuade you to come to London with me, and <lb/>
offered to get leave of absence for you and pay all <lb/>
your expenses, and give you something over if I suc- <lb/>
ceeded in making the sale; and you would not listen <lb/>
to me, said I wouldn't succeed, and you couldn't afford <lb/>
to lose the run of business and be no end of time get- <lb/>
ting the hang of things again when you got back home. <lb/>
And yet here you are. How odd it all is! How did <lb/>
you happen to come, and whatever <i>did</i> give you this <lb/>
incredible start?"</p>
<p>"Oh, just an accident. It's a long story&#x2014;a <lb/>
romance, a body may say. I'll tell you all about it, <lb/>
but not now."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"The end of this month."</p>
<pb n="354"/>
<p>"That's more than a fortnight yet. It's too much <lb/>
of a strain on a person's curiosity. Make it a week."</p>
<p>"I can't. You'll know why, by and by. But how's <lb/>
the trade getting along?"</p>
<p>His cheerfulness vanished like a breath, and he said <lb/>
with a sigh:</p>
<p>"You were a true prophet, Hal, a true prophet. I <lb/>
wish I hadn't come. I don't want to talk about it."</p>
<p>"But you must. You must come and stop with me <lb/>
to-night, when we leave here, and tell me all about it."</p>
<p>"Oh, may I? Are you in earnest?" and the water <lb/>
showed in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes; I want to hear the whole story, every word."</p>
<p>"I'm so grateful! Just to find a human interest <lb/>
once more, in some voice and in some eye, in me and <lb/>
affairs of mine, after what I've been through here&#x2014; <lb/>
lord! I could go down on my knees for it!"</p>
<p>He gripped my hand hard, and braced up, and was <lb/>
all right and lively after that for the dinner&#x2014;which <lb/>
didn't come off. No; the usual thing happened, the <lb/>
thing that is always happening under that vicious and <lb/>
aggravating English system&#x2014;the matter of precedence <lb/>
couldn't be settled, and so there was no dinner. <lb/>
Englishmen always eat dinner before they go out to <lb/>
dinner, because <i>they</i> know the risks they are running; <lb/>
but nobody ever warns the stranger, and so he walks <lb/>
placidly into the trap. Of course, nobody was hurt <lb/>
this time, because we had all been to dinner, none of <lb/>
us being novices excepting Hastings, and he having <lb/>
been informed by the minister at the time that he in- <lb/>
vited him that in deference to the English custom he <lb/>
had not provided any dinner. Everybody took a lady <lb/>
and processioned down to the dining-room, because it <lb/>
is usual to go through the motions; but there the dis- <lb/>
pute began. The Duke of Shoreditch wanted to take <lb/>
precedence, and sit at the head of the table, holding <lb/>
<pb n="355"/>
that he outranked a minister who represented merely a <lb/>
nation and not a monarch; but I stood for my rights, <lb/>
and refused to yield. In the gossip column I ranked all <lb/>
dukes not royal, and said so, and claimed precedence <lb/>
of this one. It couldn't be settled, of course, struggle <lb/>
as we might and did, he finally (and injudiciously) <lb/>
trying to play birth and antiquity, and I "seeing" his <lb/>
Conqueror and "raising" him with Adam, whose <lb/>
direct posterity I was, as shown by my name, while <i>he</i> <lb/>
was of a collateral branch, as shown by <i>his</i>, and by <lb/>
his recent Norman origin; so we all processioned back <lb/>
to the drawing-room again and had a perpendicular <lb/>
lunch&#x2014;plate of sardines and a strawberry, and you <lb/>
group yourself and stand up and eat it. Here the <lb/>
religion of precedence is not so strenuous; the two <lb/>
persons of highest rank chuck up a shilling, the one <lb/>
that wins has first go at his strawberry, and the loser <lb/>
gets the shilling. The next two chuck up, then the <lb/>
next two, and so on. After refreshment, tables were <lb/>
brought, and we all played cribbage, sixpence a game. <lb/>
The English never play any game for amusement. If <lb/>
they can't make something or lose something&#x2014;they <lb/>
don't care which&#x2014;they won't play.</p>
<p>We had a lovely time; certainly two of us had, Miss <lb/>
Langham and I. I was so bewitched with her that I <lb/>
couldn't count my hands if they went above a double <lb/>
sequence; and when I struck home I never discovered <lb/>
it, and started up the outside row again, and would <lb/>
have lost the game every time, only the girl did the <lb/>
same, she being in just my condition, you see; and <lb/>
consequently neither of us ever got out, or cared to <lb/>
wonder why we didn't; we only just knew we were <lb/>
happy, and didn't wish to know anything else, and I <lb/>
didn't want to be interrupted. And I <i>told</i> her&#x2014; <lb/>
I did, indeed&#x2014;told her I loved her; and she&#x2014;well, <lb/>
she blushed till her hair turned red, but she liked it; <lb/>
<pb n="356"/>
she <i>said</i> she did. Oh, there was never such an even- <lb/>
ing! Every time I pegged I put on a postscript; <lb/>
every time she pegged she acknowledged receipt of it, <lb/>
counting the hands the same. Why, I couldn't even <lb/>
say "Two for his heels" without adding, "<i>My</i>, how <lb/>
sweet you do look!" and she would say, "Fifteen <lb/>
two, fifteen four, fifteen six, and a pair are eight, and <lb/>
eight are sixteen&#x2014;<i>do</i> you think so?"&#x2014;peeping out <lb/>
aslant from under her lashes, you know, so sweet and <lb/>
cunning. Oh, it was just <i>too</i>-too!</p>
<p>Well, I was perfectly honest and square with her; <lb/>
told her I hadn't a cent in the world but just the <lb/>
million-pound note she's heard so much talk about, <lb/>
and <i>it</i> didn't belong to me, and that started her curi- <lb/>
osity; and then I talked low, and told her the whole <lb/>
history right from the start, and it nearly killed her <lb/>
laughing. What in the nation she could find to laugh <lb/>
about <i>I</i> couldn't see, but there it was; every half- <lb/>
minute some new detail would fetch her, and I would <lb/>
have to stop as much as a minute and a half to give <lb/>
her a chance to settle down again. Why, she laughed <lb/>
herself lame&#x2014;she did, indeed; I never saw anything <lb/>
like it. I mean I never saw a painful story&#x2014;a story <lb/>
of a person's troubles and worries and fears&#x2014;produce <lb/>
just <i>that</i> kind of effect before. So I loved her all the <lb/>
more, seeing she could be so cheerful when there <lb/>
wasn't anything to be cheerful about; for I might <lb/>
soon need that kind of wife, you know, the way things <lb/>
looked. Of course, I told her we should have to wait <lb/>
a couple of years, till I could catch up on my salary; <lb/>
but she didn't mind that, only she hoped I would be as <lb/>
careful as possible in the matter of expenses, and not <lb/>
let them run the least risk of trenching on our third <lb/>
year's pay. Then she began to get a little worried, <lb/>
and wondered if we were making any mistake, and <lb/>
starting the salary on a higher figure for the first year <lb/>
<pb n="357"/>
than I would get. This was good sense, and it made <lb/>
me feel a little less confident than I had been feeling <lb/>
before; but it gave me a good business idea, and I <lb/>
brought it frankly out.</p>
<p>"Portia, dear, would you mind going with me that <lb/>
day, when I confront those old gentlemen?"</p>
<p>She shrank a little, but said:</p>
<p>"N-o; if my being with you would help hearten <lb/>
you. But&#x2014;would it be quite proper, do you think?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't know that it would&#x2014;in fact, I'm <lb/>
afraid it wouldn't; but, you see, there's so <i>much</i> de- <lb/>
pendent upon it that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Then I'll go anyway, proper or improper," she <lb/>
said, with a beautiful and generous enthusiasm. "Oh, <lb/>
I shall be so happy to think I'm helping!"</p>
<p>"Helping, dear? Why, you'll be doing it all. <lb/>
You're so beautiful and so lovely and so winning, <lb/>
that with you there I can pile our salary up till I break <lb/>
those good old fellows, and they'll never have the <lb/>
heart to struggle."</p>
<p>Sho! you should have seen the rich blood mount, <lb/>
and her happy eyes shine!</p>
<p>"You wicked flatterer! There isn't a word of truth <lb/>
in what you say, but still I'll go with you. Maybe it <lb/>
will teach you not to expect other people to look with <lb/>
your eyes."</p>
<p>Were my doubts dissipated? Was my confidence <lb/>
restored? You may judge by this fact: privately I <lb/>
raised my salary to twelve hundred the first year on <lb/>
the spot. But I didn't tell her; I saved it for a sur- <lb/>
prise.</p>
<p>All the way home I was in the clouds, Hastings <lb/>
talking, I not hearing a word. When he and I entered <lb/>
my parlor, he brought me to myself with his fervent <lb/>
appreciations of my manifold comforts and luxuries.</p>
<p>"Let me just stand here a little and look my fill. <lb/>
<pb n="358"/>
Dear me! it's a palace&#x2014;it's just a palace! And in it <lb/>
everything a body <i>could</i> desire, including cosey coal <lb/>
fire and supper standing ready. Henry, it doesn't <lb/>
merely make me realize how rich you are; it makes me <lb/>
realize, to the bone, to the marrow, how poor I am&#x2014; <lb/>
how poor I am, and how miserable, how defeated, <lb/>
routed, annihilated!"</p>
<p>Plague take it! this language gave me the cold <lb/>
shudders. It scared me broad awake, and made me <lb/>
comprehend that I was standing on a half-inch crust, <lb/>
with a crater underneath. <i>I</i> didn't know I had been <lb/>
dreaming&#x2014;that is, I hadn't been allowing myself to <lb/>
know it for a while back; but <i>now</i>&#x2014;oh, dear! Deep <lb/>
in debt, not a cent in the world, a lovely girl's happi- <lb/>
ness or woe in my hands, and nothing in front of me <lb/>
but a salary which might never&#x2014;oh, <i>would</i> never&#x2014; <lb/>
materialize! Oh, oh, oh! I am ruined past hope! <lb/>
nothing can save me!</p>
<p>"Henry, the mere unconsidered drippings of your <lb/>
daily income would&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, my daily income! Here, down with this hot <lb/>
Scotch, and cheer up your soul. Here's with you! <lb/>
Or, no&#x2014;you're hungry; sit down and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Not a bite for me; I'm past it. I can't eat, these <lb/>
days; but I'll drink with you till I drop. Come!"</p>
<p>"Barrel for barrel, I'm with you! Ready? Here <lb/>
we go! Now, then, Lloyd, unreel your story while I <lb/>
brew."</p>
<p>"Unreel it? What, again?"</p>
<p>"Again? What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"Why, I mean do you want to hear it <i>over</i> again?"</p>
<p>"Do I want to hear it <i>over</i> again? This <i>is</i> a <lb/>
puzzler. Wait; don't take any more of that liquid. <lb/>
You don't need it."</p>
<p>"Look here, Henry, you alarm me. Didn't I tell <lb/>
you the whole story on the way here?"</p>
<pb n="359"/>
<p>"You?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I."</p>
<p>"I'll be hanged if I heard a word of it."</p>
<p>"Henry, this is a serious thing. It troubles me. <lb/>
What did you take up yonder at the minister's?"</p>
<p>Then it all flashed on me, and I owned up like a <lb/>
man.</p>
<p>"I took the dearest girl in this world&#x2014;prisoner!"</p>
<p>So then he came with a rush, and we shook, and <lb/>
shook, and shook till our hands ached; and he didn't <lb/>
blame me for not having heard a word of a story which <lb/>
had lasted while we walked three miles. He just sat <lb/>
down then, like the patient, good fellow he was, and <lb/>
told it all over again. Synopsized, it amounted to <lb/>
this: He had come to England with what he thought <lb/>
was a grand opportunity; he had an "option" to sell <lb/>
the Gould and Curry Extension for the "locators" of <lb/>
it, and keep all he could get over a million dollars. <lb/>
He had worked hard, had pulled every wire he knew <lb/>
of, had left no honest expedient untried, had spent <lb/>
nearly all the money he had in the world, had not <lb/>
been able to get a solitary capitalist to listen to him, <lb/>
and his option would run out at the end of the month. <lb/>
In a word, he was ruined. Then he jumped up and <lb/>
cried out:</p>
<p>"Henry, you can save me! You can save me, and <lb/>
you're the only man in the universe that can. Will <lb/>
you do it? <i>Won't</i> you do it?"</p>
<p>"Tell me how. Speak out, my boy."</p>
<p>"Give me a million and my passage home for my <lb/>
'option'! Don't, <i>don't</i> refuse!"</p>
<p>I was in a kind of agony. I was right on the point <lb/>
of coming out with the words, "Lloyd, I'm a pauper <lb/>
myself&#x2014;absolutely penniless, and in <i>debt!</i>" But a <lb/>
white-hot idea came flaming through my head, and I <lb/>
gripped my jaws together, and calmed myself down till <lb/>
<pb n="360"/>
I was as cold as a capitalist. Then I said, in a com- <lb/>
mercial and self-possessed way:</p>
<p>"I will save you, Lloyd&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Then I'm already saved! God be merciful to you <lb/>
forever! If ever I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Let me finish, Lloyd. I will save you, but not in <lb/>
that way; for that would not be fair to you, after your <lb/>
hard work, and the risks you've run. I don't need to <lb/>
buy mines; I can keep my capital moving, in a com- <lb/>
mercial center like London, without that; it's what I'm <lb/>
at, all the time; but here is what I'll do. I know all <lb/>
about that mine, of course; I know its immense value, <lb/>
and can swear to it if anybody wishes it. You shall <lb/>
sell out inside of the fortnight for three millions cash, <lb/>
using my name freely, and we'll divide, share and <lb/>
share alike."</p>
<p>Do you know, he would have danced the furniture <lb/>
to kindling-wood in his insane joy, and broken every- <lb/>
thing on the place, if I hadn't tripped him up and tied <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>Then he lay there, perfectly happy, saying:</p>
<p>"I may use your name! Your name&#x2014;think of it! <lb/>
Man, they'll flock in droves, these rich Londoners; <lb/>
they'll <i>fight</i> for that stock! I'm a made man, I'm a <lb/>
made man forever, and I'll never forget you as long as <lb/>
I live!"</p>
<p>In less than twenty-four hours London was abuzz! <lb/>
I hadn't anything to do, day after day, but sit at home, <lb/>
and say to all comers:</p>
<p>"Yes; I told him to refer to me. I know the man, <lb/>
and I know the mine. His character is above reproach, <lb/>
and the mine is worth far more than he asks for it."</p>
<p>Meantime I spent all my evenings at the minister's <lb/>
with Portia. I didn't say a word to her about the <lb/>
mine; I saved it for a surprise. We talked salary; <lb/>
never anything but salary and love; sometimes love, <lb/>
<pb n="361"/>
sometimes salary, sometimes love and salary together. <lb/>
And my! the interest the minister's wife and daughter <lb/>
took in our little affair, and the endless ingenuities they <lb/>
invented to save us from interruption, and to keep the <lb/>
minister in the dark and unsuspicious&#x2014;well, it was <lb/>
just lovely of them!</p>
<p>When the month was up at last, I had a million <lb/>
dollars to my credit in the London and County Bank, <lb/>
and Hastings was fixed in the same way. Dressed at <lb/>
my level best, I drove by the house in Portland Place, <lb/>
judged by the look of things that my birds were home <lb/>
again, went on towards the minister's and got my <lb/>
precious, and we started back, talking salary with all <lb/>
our might. She was so excited and anxious that it <lb/>
made her just intolerably beautiful. I said:</p>
<p>"Dearie, the way you're looking it's a crime to <lb/>
strike for a salary a single penny under three thousand <lb/>
a year."</p>
<p>"Henry, Henry, you'll ruin us!"</p>
<p>"Don't you be afraid. Just keep up those looks, <lb/>
and trust to me. It'll all come out right."</p>
<p>So, as it turned out, I had to keep bolstering up <i>her</i> <lb/>
courage all the way. She kept pleading with me, and <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"Oh, please remember that if we ask for too much <lb/>
we may get no salary at all; and then what will become <lb/>
of us, with no way in the world to earn our living?"</p>
<p>We were ushered in by that same servant, and there <lb/>
they were, the two old gentlemen. Of course, they <lb/>
were surprised to see that wonderful creature with me, <lb/>
but I said:</p>
<p>"It's all right, gentlemen; she is my future stay <lb/>
and helpmate."</p>
<p>And I introduced them to her, and called them by <lb/>
name. It didn't surprise them; they knew I would <lb/>
know enough to consult the directory. They seated <lb/>
<pb n="362"/>
us, and were very polite to me, and very solicitous to <lb/>
relieve her from embarrassment, and put her as much <lb/>
at her ease as they could. Then I said:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I am ready to report."</p>
<p>"We are glad to hear it," said <i>my</i> man, "for now <lb/>
we can decide the bet which my brother Abel and I <lb/>
made. If you have won for me, you shall have any <lb/>
situation in my gift. Have you the million-pound <lb/>
note?"</p>
<p>"Here it is, sir," and I handed it to him.</p>
<p>"I've won!" he shouted, and slapped Abel on the <lb/>
back. "<i>Now</i> what do you say, brother?"</p>
<p>"I say he <i>did</i> survive, and I've lost twenty thousand <lb/>
pounds. I never would have believed it."</p>
<p>"I've a further report to make," I said, "and a <lb/>
pretty long one. I want you to let me come soon, <lb/>
and detail my whole month's history; and I promise <lb/>
you it's worth hearing. Meantime, take a look at that."</p>
<p>"What, man! Certificate of deposit for &#x00A3;200,000. <lb/>
Is it yours?"</p>
<p>"Mine. I earned it by thirty days' judicious use of <lb/>
that little loan you let me have. And the only use I <lb/>
made of it was to buy trifles and offer the bill in <lb/>
change."</p>
<p>"Come, this is astonishing! It's incredible, man!"</p>
<p>"Never mind, I'll prove it. Don't take my word <lb/>
unsupported."</p>
<p>But now Portia's turn was come to be surprised. <lb/>
Her eyes were spread wide, and she said:</p>
<p>"Henry, is that really your money? Have you <lb/>
been fibbing to me?"</p>
<p>"I have, indeed, dearie. But you'll forgive me, <i>I</i> <lb/>
know."</p>
<p>She put up an arch pout, and said:</p>
<p>"Don't you be so sure. You are a naughty thing <lb/>
to deceive me so!"</p>
<pb n="363"/>
<p>"Oh, you'll get over it, sweetheart, you'll get over <lb/>
it; it was only fun, you know. Come, let's be going."</p>
<p>"But wait, wait! The situation, you know. I want <lb/>
to give you the situation," said my man.</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "I'm just as grateful as I can be, <lb/>
but really I don't want one."</p>
<p>"But you can have the very choicest one in my gift."</p>
<p>"Thanks again, with all my heart; but I don't even <lb/>
want <i>that</i> one."</p>
<p>"Henry, I'm ashamed of you. You don't half <lb/>
thank the good gentleman. May I do it for you?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, you shall, dear, if you can improve it. <lb/>
Let us see you try."</p>
<p>She walked to my man, got up in his lap, put her <lb/>
arm round his neck, and kissed him right on the <lb/>
mouth. Then the two old gentlemen shouted with <lb/>
laughter, but I was dumfounded, just petrified, as you <lb/>
may say. Portia said:</p>
<p>"Papa, he has said you haven't a situation in your <lb/>
gift that he'd take; and I feel just as hurt as&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"My darling, is that your papa?"</p>
<p>"Yes; he's my step-papa, and the dearest one that <lb/>
ever was. You understand now, don't you, why I <lb/>
was able to laugh when you told me at the minister's, <lb/>
not knowing my relationships, what trouble and worry <lb/>
papa's and Uncle Abel's scheme was giving you?"</p>
<p>Of course, I spoke right up now, without any fool- <lb/>
ing, and went straight to the point.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dearest dear sir, I want to take back what <lb/>
I said. You <i>have</i> got a situation open that I want."</p>
<p>"Name it."</p>
<p>"Son-in-law."</p>
<p>"Well, well, well! But you know, if you haven't <lb/>
ever served in that capacity, you, of course, can't <lb/>
furnish recommendations of a sort to satisfy the condi- <lb/>
tions of the contract, and so&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="364"/>
<p>"Try me&#x2014;oh, do, I beg of you! Only just try <lb/>
me thirty or forty years, and if&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, well, all right; it's but a little thing to ask, <lb/>
take her along."</p>
<p>Happy, we two? There are not words enough in <lb/>
the unabridged to describe it. And when London got <lb/>
the whole history, a day or two later, of my month's <lb/>
adventures with that bank-note, and how they ended, <lb/>
did London talk, and have a good time? Yes.</p>
<p>My Portia's papa took that friendly and hospitable <lb/>
bill back to the Bank of England and cashed it; then <lb/>
the Bank canceled it and made him a present of it, <lb/>
and he gave it to us at our wedding, and it has always <lb/>
hung in its frame in the sacredest place in our home <lb/>
ever since. For it gave me my Portia. But for it I <lb/>
could not have remained in London, would not have <lb/>
appeared at the minister's, never should have met her. <lb/>
And so I always say, "Yes, it's a million-pounder, as <lb/>
you see; but it never made but one purchase in its <lb/>
life, and <i>then</i> got the article for only about a tenth part <lb/>
of its value."</p>

<head><b>MENTAL TELEGRAPHY</b></head>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>a manuscript with a history</smcap></head>
<q><smcap>Note to the Editor</smcap>.&#x2014;By glancing over the enclosed bundle of rusty <lb/>
old manuscript, you will perceive that I once made a great discovery: the <lb/>
discovery that certain sorts of thing which, from the beginning of the world, <lb/>
had always been regarded as merely "curious coincidences"&#x2014;that is to <lb/>
say, accidents&#x2014;were no more accidental than is the sending and receiving <lb/>
of a telegram an accident. I made this discovery sixteen or seventeen years <lb/>
ago, and gave it a name&#x2014;"Mental Telegraphy." It is the same thing <lb/>
around the outer edges of which the Psychical Society of England began to <lb/>
group (and play with) four or five years ago, and which they named <lb/>
"Telepathy." Within the last two or three years they have penetrated <lb/>
towards the heart of the matter, however, and have found out that mind <lb/>
can act upon mind in a quite detailed and elaborate way over vast stretches <lb/>
of land and water. And they have succeeded in doing, by their great credit <lb/>
and influence, what I could never have done&#x2014;they have convinced the <lb/>
world that mental telegraphy is not a jest, but a fact, and that it is a thing <lb/>
not rare, but exceedingly common. They have done our age a service&#x2014; <lb/>
and a very great service, I think.</q>
<q>In this old manuscript you will find mention of an extraordinary experi- <lb/>
ence of mine in the mental telegraphic line, of date about the year 1874 or <lb/>
1875&#x2014;the one concerning the Great Bonanza book. It was this experi- <lb/>
ence that called my attention to the matter under consideration. I began <lb/>
to keep a record, after that, of such experiences of mine as seemed <lb/>
explicable by the theory that minds telegraph thoughts to each other. In <lb/>
1878 I went to Germany and began to write the book called <i>A Tramp <lb/>
Abroad</i>. The bulk of this old batch of manuscript was written at that time <lb/>
and for that book. But I removed it when I came to revise the volume for <lb/>
the press; for I feared that the public would treat the thing as a joke and <lb/>
throw it aside, whereas I was in earnest.</q>
<pb n="366"/>
<q>At home, eight or ten years ago, I tried to creep in under shelter of an <lb/>
authority grave enough to protect the article from ridicule&#x2014;the <i>North <lb/>
American Review</i>. But Mr. Metcalf was too wary for me. He said that <lb/>
to treat these mere "coincidences" seriously was a thing which the <i>Review</i> <lb/>
couldn't dare to do; that I must put either my name or my <foreign lang="fre"><i>nom de plume</i></foreign> <lb/>
to the article, and thus save the <i>Review</i> from harm. But I couldn't consent <lb/>
to that; it would be the surest possible way to defeat my desire that the <lb/>
public should receive the thing seriously, and be willing to stop and give it <lb/>
some fair degree of attention. So I pigeon-holed the MS., because I could <lb/>
not get it published anonymously.</q>
<q>Now see how the world has moved since then. These small experiences <lb/>
of mine, which were too formidable at that time for admission to a grave <lb/>
magazine&#x2014;if the magazine must allow them to appear as something above <lb/>
and beyond "accidents" and "coincidences"&#x2014;are trifling and common- <lb/>
place now, since the flood of light recently cast upon mental telegraphy by <lb/>
the intelligent labors of the Psychical Society. But I think they are worth <lb/>
publishing, just to show what harmless and ordinary matters were considered <lb/>
dangerous and incredible eight or ten years ago.</q>
<q>As I have said, the bulk of this old manuscript was written in 1878; a <lb/>
later part was written from time to time two, three, and four years after- <lb/>
wards. The "Postscript" I add to-day.</q>
<p><smcap>May</smcap>, '78.&#x2014;Another of those apparently trifling <lb/>
things has happened to me which puzzle and per- <lb/>
plex all men every now and then, keep them think- <lb/>
ing an hour or two, and leave their minds barren of <lb/>
explanation or solution at last. Here it is&#x2014;and it <lb/>
looks inconsequential enough, I am obliged to say. A <lb/>
few days ago I said: "It must be that Frank Millet <lb/>
doesn't know we are in Germany, or he would have <lb/>
written long before this. I have been on the point of <lb/>
dropping him a line at least a dozen times during the <lb/>
past six weeks, but I always decided to wait a day or <lb/>
two longer, and see if we shouldn't hear from him. <lb/>
But now I <i>will</i> write." And so I did. I directed the <lb/>
letter to Paris, and thought, "<i>Now</i> we shall hear from <lb/>
him before this letter is fifty miles from Heidelberg&#x2014; <lb/>
it always happens so."</p>
<pb n="367"/>
<p>True enough; but <i>why</i> should it? That is the puz- <lb/>
zling part of it. We are always talking about letters <lb/>
"crossing" each other, for that is one of the very <lb/>
commonest accidents of this life. We call it "acci- <lb/>
dent," but perhaps we misname it. We have the in- <lb/>
stinct a dozen times a year that the letter we are writing <lb/>
is going to "cross" the other person's letter; and if <lb/>
the reader will rack his memory a little he will recall <lb/>
the fact that this presentiment had strength enough to <lb/>
it to make him cut his letter down to a decided brief- <lb/>
ness, because it would be a waste of time to write a <lb/>
letter which was going to "cross," and hence be a <lb/>
useless letter. I think that in my experience this in- <lb/>
stinct has generally come to me in cases where I had <lb/>
put off my letter a good while in the hope that the <lb/>
other person would write.</p>
<p>Yes, as I was saying, I had waited five or six weeks; <lb/>
then I wrote but three lines, because I felt and seemed <lb/>
to know that a letter from Millet would cross mine. <lb/>
And so it did. He wrote the same day that I wrote. <lb/>
The letters crossed each other. His letter went to <lb/>
Berlin, care of the American minister, who sent it to <lb/>
me. In this letter Millet said he had been trying for <lb/>
six weeks to stumble upon somebody who knew my <lb/>
German address, and at last the idea had occurred to <lb/>
him that a letter sent to the care of the embassy at <lb/>
Berlin might possibly find me.</p>
<p>Maybe it was an "accident" that he finally deter- <lb/>
mined to write me at the same moment that I finally <lb/>
determined to write him, but I think not.</p>
<p>With me the most irritating thing has been to wait a <lb/>
tedious time in a purely business matter, hoping that <lb/>
the other party will do the writing, and then sit down <lb/>
and do it myself, perfectly satisfied that that other <lb/>
man is sitting down at the same moment to write a <lb/>
letter which will "cross" mine. And yet one must <lb/>
<pb n="368"/>
go on writing, just the same; because if you get up <lb/>
from your table and postpone, that other man will do <lb/>
the same thing, exactly as if you two were harnessed <lb/>
together like the Siamese twins, and must duplicate <lb/>
each other's movements.</p>
<p>Several months before I left home a New York firm <lb/>
did some work about the house for me, and did not <lb/>
make a success of it, as it seemed to me. When the <lb/>
bill came, I wrote and said I wanted the work per- <lb/>
fected before I paid. They replied that they were <lb/>
very busy, but that as soon as they could spare the <lb/>
proper man the thing should be done. I waited more <lb/>
than two months, enduring as patiently as possible the <lb/>
companionship of bells which would fire away of their <lb/>
own accord sometimes when nobody was touching <lb/>
them, and at other times wouldn't ring though you <lb/>
struck the button with a sledge hammer. Many a time <lb/>
I got ready to write and then postponed it; but at last <lb/>
I sat down one evening and poured out my grief to the <lb/>
extent of a page or so, and then cut my letter suddenly <lb/>
short, because a strong instinct told me that the firm <lb/>
had begun to move in the matter. When I came down <lb/>
to breakfast next morning the postman had not yet <lb/>
taken my letter away, but the electrical man had been <lb/>
there, done his work, and was gone again! He had <lb/>
received his orders the previous evening from his em- <lb/>
ployers, and had come up by the night train.</p>
<p>If that was an "accident," it took about three <lb/>
months to get it up in good shape.</p>
<p>One evening last summer I arrived in Washington, <lb/>
registered at the Arlington Hotel, and went to my <lb/>
room. I read and smoked until ten o'clock; then, <lb/>
finding I was not yet sleepy, I thought I would take a <lb/>
breath of fresh air. So I went forth in the rain, and <lb/>
tramped through one street after another in an aimless <lb/>
and enjoyable way. I knew that Mr. O<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, a friend <lb/>
<pb n="369"/>
of mine, was in town, and I wished I might run across <lb/>
him; but I did not propose to hunt for him at mid- <lb/>
night, especially as I did not know where he was stop- <lb/>
ping. Towards twelve o'clock the streets had become <lb/>
so deserted that I felt lonesome; so I stepped into a <lb/>
cigar shop far up the avenue, and remained there <lb/>
fifteen minutes, listening to some bummers discussing <lb/>
national politics. Suddenly the spirit of prophecy <lb/>
came upon me, and I said to myself, "Now I will go <lb/>
out at this door, turn to the left, walk ten steps, and <lb/>
meet Mr. O<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> face to face." I did it, too! I could <lb/>
not see his face, because he had an umbrella before it, <lb/>
and it was pretty dark anyhow, but he interrupted the <lb/>
man he was walking and talking with, and I recognized <lb/>
his voice and stopped him.</p>
<p>That I should step out there and stumble upon Mr. <lb/>
O<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> was nothing, but that I should know before- <lb/>
hand that I was going to do it was a good deal. It is <lb/>
a very curious thing when you come to look at it. I <lb/>
stood far within the cigar shop when I delivered my <lb/>
prophecy; I walked about five steps to the door, <lb/>
opened it, closed it after me, walked down a flight of <lb/>
three steps to the sidewalk, then turned to the left and <lb/>
walked four or five more, and found my man. I repeat <lb/>
that in itself the thing was nothing; but to know it <lb/>
would happen so <i>beforehand</i>, wasn't that really curious?</p>
<p>I have criticised absent people so often, and then <lb/>
discovered, to my humiliation, that I was talking with <lb/>
their relatives, that I have grown superstitious about <lb/>
that sort of thing and dropped it. How like an idiot <lb/>
one feels after a blunder like that?</p>
<p>We are always mentioning people, and in that very <lb/>
instant they appear before us. We laugh, and say, <lb/>
"Speak of the devil," and so forth, and there we <lb/>
drop it, considering it an "accident." It is a cheap <lb/>
and convenient way of disposing of a grave and very <lb/>
<pb n="370"/>
puzzling mystery. The fact is, it does seem to happen <lb/>
too often to be an accident.</p>
<p>Now I come to the oddest thing that ever happened <lb/>
to me. Two or three years ago I was lying in bed, <lb/>
idly musing, one morning&#x2014;it was the 2d of March&#x2014; <lb/>
when suddenly a red-hot new idea came whistling down <lb/>
into my camp, and exploded with such comprehensive <lb/>
effectiveness as to sweep the vicinity clean of rubbishy <lb/>
reflections, and fill the air with their dust and flying <lb/>
fragments. This idea, stated in simple phrase, was <lb/>
that the time was ripe and the market ready for a <lb/>
certain book; a book which ought to be written at <lb/>
once; a book which must command attention and be <lb/>
of peculiar interest&#x2014;to wit, a book about the Nevada <lb/>
silver mines. The "Great Bonanza" was a new won- <lb/>
der then, and everybody was talking about it. It <lb/>
seemed to me that the person best qualified to write <lb/>
this book was Mr. William H. Wright, a journalist of <lb/>
Virginia, Nevada, by whose side I had scribbled many <lb/>
months when I was a reporter there ten or twelve years <lb/>
before. He might be alive still; he might be dead; <lb/>
I could not tell; but I would write him, anyway. I <lb/>
began by merely and modestly suggesting that he make <lb/>
such a book; but my interest grew as I went on, and I <lb/>
ventured to map out what I thought ought to be the <lb/>
plan of the work, he being an old friend, and not given <lb/>
to taking good intentions for ill. I even dealt with <lb/>
details, and suggested the order and sequence which <lb/>
they should follow. I was about to put the manu- <lb/>
script in an envelope, when the thought occurred to <lb/>
me that if this book should be written at my sugges- <lb/>
tion, and then no publisher happened to want it, I <lb/>
should feel uncomfortable; so I concluded to keep my <lb/>
letter back until I should have secured a publisher. I <lb/>
pigeon-holed my document, and dropped a note to my <lb/>
own publisher, asking him to name a day for a busi- <lb/>
<pb n="371"/>
ness consultation. He was out of town on a far <lb/>
journey.</p>
<p>My note remained unanswered, and at the end of <lb/>
three or four days the whole matter had passed out of <lb/>
my mind. On the 9th of March the postman brought <lb/>
three or four letters, and among them a thick one <lb/>
whose superscription was in a hand which seemed <lb/>
dimly familiar to me. I could not "place" it at first, <lb/>
but presently I succeeded. Then I said to a visiting <lb/>
relative who was present:</p>
<p>"Now I will do a miracle. I will tell you every- <lb/>
thing this letter contains&#x2014;date, signature, and all&#x2014; <lb/>
without breaking the seal. It is from a Mr. Wright, <lb/>
of Virginia, Nevada, and is dated the 2d of March&#x2014; <lb/>
seven days ago. Mr. Wright proposes to make a book <lb/>
about the silver mines and the Great Bonanza, and <lb/>
asks what I, as a friend, think of the idea. He says <lb/>
his subjects are to be so and so, their order and <lb/>
sequence so and so, and he will close with a history of <lb/>
the chief feature of the book, the Great Bonanza."</p>
<p>I opened the letter, and showed that I had stated the <lb/>
date and the contents correctly. Mr. Wright's letter <lb/>
simply contained what my own letter, written on the <lb/>
same date, contained, and mine still lay in its pigeon- <lb/>
hole, where it had been lying during the seven days <lb/>
since it was written.</p>
<p>There was no clairvoyance about this, if I rightly <lb/>
comprehend what clairvoyance is. I think the clair- <lb/>
voyant professes to actually <i>see</i> concealed writing, and <lb/>
read it off word for word. This was not my case. I <lb/>
only seemed to know, and to know absolutely, the <lb/>
contents of the letter in detail and due order, but I had <lb/>
to <i>word</i> them myself. I translated them, so to speak, <lb/>
out of Wright's language into my own.</p>
<p>Wright's letter and the one which I had written to <lb/>
him but never sent were in substance the same.</p>
<pb n="372"/>
<p>Necessarily this could not come by accident; such <lb/>
elaborate accidents cannot happen. Chance might <lb/>
have duplicated one or two of the details, but she <lb/>
would have broken down on the rest. I could not <lb/>
doubt&#x2014;there was no tenable reason for doubting&#x2014; <lb/>
that Mr. Wright's mind and mine had been in close <lb/>
and crystal-clear communication with each other across <lb/>
three thousand miles of mountain and desert on the <lb/>
morning of the 2d of March. I did not consider that <lb/>
both minds <i>originated</i> that succession of ideas, but <lb/>
that one mind originated it, and simply telegraphed it <lb/>
to the other. I was curious to know which brain was <lb/>
the telegrapher and which the receiver, so I wrote and <lb/>
asked for particulars. Mr. Wright's reply showed that <lb/>
his mind had done the originating and telegraphing, <lb/>
and mine the receiving. Mark that significant thing <lb/>
now; consider for a moment how many a splendid <lb/>
"original" idea has been unconsciously stolen from a <lb/>
man three thousand miles away! If one should ques- <lb/>
tion that this is so, let him look into the cyclop&#x00E6;dia <lb/>
and con once more that curious thing in the history of <lb/>
inventions which has puzzled every one so much&#x2014; <lb/>
that is, the frequency with which the same machine or <lb/>
other contrivance has been invented at the same time <lb/>
by several persons in different quarters of the globe. <lb/>
The world was without an electric telegraph for several <lb/>
thousand years; then Professor Henry, the American, <lb/>
Wheatstone in England, Morse on the sea, and a <lb/>
German in Munich, all invented it at the same time. <lb/>
The discovery of certain ways of applying steam was <lb/>
made in two or three countries in the same year. Is it <lb/>
not possible that inventors are constantly and unwit- <lb/>
tingly stealing each other's ideas while they stand <lb/>
thousands of miles asunder?</p>
<p>Last spring a literary friend of mine,<ref target="n3">*</ref><note id="n3" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>W. D. Howells.</p></note> who lived a <lb/>
<pb n="373"/>
hundred miles away, paid me a visit, and in the course <lb/>
of our talk he said he had made a discovery&#x2014;con- <lb/>
ceived an entirely new idea&#x2014;one which certainly had <lb/>
never been used in literature. He told me what it was. <lb/>
I handed him a manuscript, and said he would find <lb/>
substantially the same idea in that&#x2014;a manuscript <lb/>
which I had written a week before. The idea had <lb/>
been in my mind since the previous November; it had <lb/>
only entered his while I was putting it on paper, a <lb/>
week gone by. He had not yet written his; so he left <lb/>
it unwritten, and gracefully made over all his right and <lb/>
title in the idea to me.</p>
<p>The following statement, which I have clipped from <lb/>
a newspaper, is true. I had the facts from Mr. <lb/>
Howells's lips when the episode was new: <lb/>
<q>"A remarkable story of a literary coincidence is told in Mr. Howells's <lb/>
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i> serial 'Dr. Breen's Practice.' A lady of Rochester, New <lb/>
York, contributed to the magazine, after 'Dr. Breen's Practice' was in <lb/>
type, a short story which so much resembled Mr. Howells's that he felt it <lb/>
necessary to call upon her and explain the situation of affairs in order that <lb/>
no charge of plagiarism might be preferred against him. He showed her <lb/>
the proof-sheets of his story, and satisfied her that the similarity between <lb/>
her work and his was one of those strange coincidences which have from <lb/>
time to time occurred in the literary world."</q></p>
<p>I had read portions of Mr. Howells's story, both in <lb/>
MS. and in proof, before the lady offered her contribu- <lb/>
tion to the magazine.</p>
<p>Here is another case. I clip it from a newspaper: <lb/>
<q>"The republication of Miss Alcott's novel <i>Moods</i> recalls to a writer in <lb/>
the Boston <i>Post</i> a singular coincidence which was brought to light before <lb/>
the book was first published: 'Miss Anna M. Crane, of Baltimore, published <lb/>
<i>Emily Chester</i>, a novel which was pronounced a very striking and strong <lb/>
story. A comparison of this book with <i>Moods</i> showed that the two writers, <lb/>
though entire strangers to each other, and living hundreds of miles apart, <lb/>
had both chosen the same subject for their novels, had followed almost the <lb/>
same line of treatment up to a certain point, where the parallel ceased, and <lb/>
the denou&#x00E9;ments were entirely opposite. And even more curious, the <lb/>
<pb n="374"/>
leading characters in both books had identically the same names, so that the <lb/>
names in Miss Alcott's novel had to be changed. Then the book was pub- <lb/>
lished by Loring.'"</q></p>
<p>Four or five times within my recollection there has <lb/>
been a lively newspaper war in this country over poems <lb/>
whose authorship was claimed by two or three different <lb/>
people at the same time. There was a war of this kind <lb/>
over "Nothing to Wear," "Beautiful Snow," "Rock <lb/>
me to Sleep, Mother," and also over one of Mr. Will <lb/>
Carleton's early ballads, I think. These were all <lb/>
blameless cases of unintentional and unwitting mental <lb/>
telegraphy, I judge.</p>
<p>A word more as to Mr. Wright. He had had his <lb/>
book in mind some time; consequently he, and not I, <lb/>
had originated the idea of it. The subject was entirely <lb/>
foreign to my thoughts; I was wholly absorbed in <lb/>
other things. Yet this friend, whom I had not seen <lb/>
and had hardly thought of for eleven years, was able <lb/>
to shoot his thoughts at me across three thousand <lb/>
miles of country, and fill my head with them, to the <lb/>
exclusion of every other interest, in a single moment. <lb/>
He had begun his letter after finishing his work on the <lb/>
morning paper&#x2014;a little after three o'clock, he said. <lb/>
When it was three in the morning in Nevada it was <lb/>
about six in Hartford, where I lay awake thinking <lb/>
about nothing in particular; and just about that time <lb/>
his ideas came pouring into my head from across the <lb/>
continent, and I got up and put them on paper, under <lb/>
the impression that they were my own original thoughts.</p>
<p>I have never seen any mesmeric or clairvoyant per- <lb/>
formances or spiritual manifestations which were in the <lb/>
least degree convincing&#x2014;a fact which is not of conse- <lb/>
quence, since my opportunities have been meager; but <lb/>
I am forced to believe that one human mind (still in- <lb/>
habiting the flesh) can communicate with another, over <lb/>
any sort of a distance, and without any <i>artificial</i> <lb/>
<pb n="375"/>
preparation of "sympathetic conditions" to act as a <lb/>
transmitting agent. I suppose that when the sympa- <lb/>
thetic conditions happen to exist the two minds com- <lb/>
municate with each other, and that otherwise they <lb/>
don't; and I suppose that if the sympathetic condi- <lb/>
tions could be kept up right along, the two minds <lb/>
would continue to correspond without limit as to time.</p>
<p>Now there is that curious thing which happens to <lb/>
everybody: suddenly a succession of thoughts or sen- <lb/>
sations flocks in upon you, which startles you with the <lb/>
weird idea that you have ages ago experienced just this <lb/>
succession of thoughts or sensations in a previous <lb/>
existence. The previous existence is possible, no <lb/>
doubt, but I am persuaded that the solution of this <lb/>
hoary mystery lies not there, but in the fact that some <lb/>
far-off stranger has been telegraphing his thoughts and <lb/>
sensations into your consciousness, and that he stopped <lb/>
because some counter-current or other obstruction in- <lb/>
truded and broke the line of communication. Perhaps <lb/>
they seem repetitions to you because they <i>are</i> repeti- <lb/>
tions, got at second hand from the other man. Possibly <lb/>
Mr. Brown, the "mind-reader," reads other people's <lb/>
minds, possibly he does not; but I know of a surety <lb/>
that I have read another man's mind, and therefore I <lb/>
do not see why Mr. Brown shouldn't do the like also.</p>
<p>I wrote the foregoing about three years ago, in <lb/>
Heidelberg, and laid the manuscript aside, purposing <lb/>
to add to it instances of mind-telegraphing from time <lb/>
to time as they should fall under my experience. <lb/>
Meantime the "crossing" of letters has been so fre- <lb/>
quent as to become monotonous. However, I have <lb/>
managed to get something useful out of this hint; for <lb/>
now, when I get tired of waiting upon a man whom I <lb/>
very much wish to hear from, I sit down and <i>compel</i> <lb/>
him to write, whether he wants to or not; that is to <lb/>
<pb n="376"/>
say, I sit down and write him, and then tear my letter <lb/>
up, satisfied that my act has forced him to write me at <lb/>
the same moment. I do not need to mail my letter&#x2014; <lb/>
the writing it is the only essential thing.</p>
<p>Of course I have grown superstitious about this <lb/>
letter-crossing business&#x2014;this was natural. We stayed <lb/>
awhile in Venice after leaving Heidelberg. One day I <lb/>
was going down the Grand Canal in a gondola, when <lb/>
I heard a shout behind me, and looked around to see <lb/>
what the matter was; a gondola was rapidly following, <lb/>
and the gondolier was making signs to me to stop. I <lb/>
did so, and the pursuing boat ranged up alongside. <lb/>
There was an American lady in it&#x2014;a resident of <lb/>
Venice. She was in a good deal of distress. She said:</p>
<p>"There's a New York gentleman and his wife at the <lb/>
Hotel Britannia who arrived a week ago, expecting to <lb/>
find news of their son, whom they have heard nothing <lb/>
about during eight months. There was no news. The <lb/>
lady is down sick with despair; the gentleman can't <lb/>
sleep or eat. Their son arrived at San Francisco eight <lb/>
months ago, and announced the fact in a letter to his <lb/>
parents the same day. That is the last trace of him. <lb/>
The parents have been in Europe ever since; but their <lb/>
trip has been spoiled, for they have occupied their time <lb/>
simply in drifting restlessly from place to place, and <lb/>
writing letters everywhere and to everybody, begging <lb/>
for news of their son; but the mystery remains as <lb/>
dense as ever. Now the gentleman wants to stop <lb/>
writing and go to cabling. He wants to cable San <lb/>
Francisco. He has never done it before, because he is <lb/>
afraid of&#x2014;of he doesn't know what&#x2014;death of his <lb/>
son, no doubt. But he wants somebody to <i>advise</i> him <lb/>
to cable; wants me to do it. Now I simply can't; for <lb/>
if no news came, that mother yonder would die. So I <lb/>
have chased you up in order to get you to support me <lb/>
in urging him to be patient, and put the thing off a <lb/>
<pb n="377"/>
week or two longer; it may be the saving of this lady. <lb/>
Come along; let's not lose any time."</p>
<p>So I went along, but I had a programme of my own. <lb/>
When I was introduced to the gentleman I said: "I <lb/>
have some superstitions, but they are worthy of re- <lb/>
spect. If you will cable San Francisco immediately, <lb/>
you will hear news of your son inside of twenty-four <lb/>
hours. I don't know that you will get the news from <lb/>
San Francisco, but you will get it from somewhere. <lb/>
The only necessary thing is to <i>cable</i>&#x2014;that is all. The <lb/>
news will come within twenty-four hours. Cable <lb/>
Peking, if you prefer; there is no choice in this matter. <lb/>
This delay is all occasioned by your not cabling long <lb/>
ago, when you were first moved to do it."</p>
<p>It seems absurd that this gentleman should have <lb/>
been cheered up by this nonsense, but he was; he <lb/>
brightened up at once, and sent his cablegram; and <lb/>
next day, at noon, when a long letter arrived from his <lb/>
lost son, the man was as grateful to me as if I had <lb/>
really had something to do with the hurrying up of <lb/>
that letter. The son had shipped from San Francisco <lb/>
in a sailing vessel, and his letter was written from the <lb/>
first port he touched at, months afterwards.</p>
<p>This incident argues nothing, and is valueless. I <lb/>
insert it only to show how strong is the superstition <lb/>
which "letter-crossing" has bred in me. I was so <lb/>
sure that a cablegram sent to any place, no matter <lb/>
where, would defeat itself by "crossing" the incoming <lb/>
news, that my confidence was able to raise up a hope- <lb/>
less man, and make him cheery and hopeful.</p>
<p>But here are two or three incidents which come <lb/>
strictly under the head of mind-telegraphing. One <lb/>
Monday morning, about a year ago, the mail came in, <lb/>
and I picked up one of the letters and said to a friend: <lb/>
"Without opening this letter I will tell you what it <lb/>
says. It is from Mrs. <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, and she says she was <lb/>
<pb n="378"/>
in New York last Saturday, and was purposing to run <lb/>
up here in the afternoon train and surprise us, but at <lb/>
the last moment changed her mind and returned west- <lb/>
ward to her home."</p>
<p>I was right; my details were exactly correct. Yet <lb/>
we had had no suspicion that Mrs. <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> was coming <lb/>
to New York, or that she had even a remote intention <lb/>
of visiting us.</p>
<p>I smoke a good deal&#x2014;that is to say, all the time&#x2014; <lb/>
so, during seven years, I have tried to keep a box of <lb/>
matches handy, behind a picture on the mantel-piece; <lb/>
but I have had to take it out in trying, because George <lb/>
(colored), who makes the fires and lights the gas, <lb/>
always uses my matches, and never replaces them. <lb/>
Commands and persuasions have gone for nothing with <lb/>
him all these seven years. One day last summer, when <lb/>
our family had been away from home several months, <lb/>
I said to a member of the household:</p>
<p>"Now, with all this long holiday, and nothing in the <lb/>
way to interrupt&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I can finish the sentence for you," said the mem- <lb/>
ber of the household.</p>
<p>"Do it, then," said I.</p>
<p>"George ought to be able, by practicing, to learn <lb/>
to let those matches alone."</p>
<p>It was correctly done. That was what I was going <lb/>
to say. Yet until that moment George and the matches <lb/>
had not been in my mind for three months, and it is <lb/>
plain that the part of the sentence which I uttered <lb/>
offers not the least cue or suggestion of what I was <lb/>
purposing to follow it with.</p>
<p>My mother<ref target="n4">*</ref><note id="n4" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>She was still living when this was written.</p></note> is descended from the younger of two <lb/>
English brothers named Lambton, who settled in this <lb/>
country a few generations ago. The tradition goes <lb/>
that the elder of the two eventually fell heir to a certain <lb/>
<pb n="379"/>
estate in England (now an earldom), and died right <lb/>
away. This has always been the way with our family. <lb/>
They always die when they could make anything by <lb/>
not doing it. The two Lambtons left plenty of Lamb- <lb/>
tons behind them; and when at last, about fifty years <lb/>
ago, the English baronetcy was exalted to an earldom, <lb/>
the great tribe of American Lambtons began to bestir <lb/>
themselves&#x2014;that is, those descended from the elder <lb/>
branch. Ever since that day one or another of these <lb/>
has been fretting his life uselessly away with schemes <lb/>
to get at his "rights." The present "rightful earl" <lb/>
&#x2014;I mean the American one&#x2014;used to write me occa- <lb/>
sionally, and try to interest me in his projected raids <lb/>
upon the title and estates by offering me a share in the <lb/>
latter portion of the spoil; but I have always managed <lb/>
to resist his temptations.</p>
<p>Well, one day last summer I was lying under a tree, <lb/>
thinking about nothing in particular, when an absurd <lb/>
idea flashed into my head, and I said to a member of <lb/>
the household, "Suppose I should live to be ninety- <lb/>
two, and dumb and blind and toothless, and just as I <lb/>
was gasping out what was left of me on my deathbed&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wait, I will finish the sentence," said a member of <lb/>
the household.</p>
<p>"Go on," said I.</p>
<p>"Somebody should rush in with a document, and <lb/>
say, 'All the other heirs are dead, and you are the <lb/>
Earl of Durham!'"</p>
<p>That is truly what I was going to say. Yet until <lb/>
that moment the subject had not entered my mind or <lb/>
been referred to in my hearing for months before. A <lb/>
few years ago this thing would have astounded me, <lb/>
but the like could not much surprise me now, though <lb/>
it happened every week; for I think I <i>know</i> now that <lb/>
mind can communicate accurately with mind without <lb/>
the aid of the slow and clumsy vehicle of speech.</p>
<pb n="380"/>
<p>This age does seem to have exhausted invention <lb/>
nearly; still, it has one important contract on its hands <lb/>
yet&#x2014;the invention of the <i>phrenophone;</i> that is to say, <lb/>
a method whereby the communicating of mind with <lb/>
mind may be brought under command and reduced to <lb/>
certainty and system. The telegraph and the tele- <lb/>
phone are going to become too slow and wordy for our <lb/>
needs. We must have the <i>thought</i> itself shot into our <lb/>
minds from a distance; then, if we need to put it into <lb/>
words, we can do that tedious work at our leisure. <lb/>
Doubtless the something which conveys our thoughts <lb/>
through the air from brain to brain is a finer and <lb/>
subtler form of electricity, and all we need do is to find <lb/>
out how to capture it and how to force it to do its <lb/>
work, as we have had to do in the case of the electric <lb/>
currents. Before the day of telegraphs neither one of <lb/>
these marvels would have seemed any easier to achieve <lb/>
than the other.</p>
<p>While I am writing this, doubtless somebody on <lb/>
the other side of the globe is writing it, too. The <lb/>
question is, am I inspiring him or is he inspiring me? <lb/>
I cannot answer that; but that these thoughts have <lb/>
been passing through somebody else's mind all the <lb/>
time I have been setting them down I have no sort <lb/>
of doubt.</p>
<p>I will close this paper with a remark which I found <lb/>
some time ago in Boswell's <i>Johnson:</i></p>
<p>"Voltaire's <i>Candide</i> is wonderfully similar in its <lb/>
plan and conduct to Johnson's <i>Rasselas;</i> insomuch <lb/>
that I have heard Johnson say that if they had not <lb/>
been published so closely one after the other that there <lb/>
was not time for imitation, <i>it would have been in vain <lb/>
to deny that the scheme of that which came latest was <lb/>
taken from the other</i>."</p>
<p>The two men were widely separated from each other <lb/>
at the time, and the sea lay between them.</p>

<head><smcap>postscript</smcap>.</head>
<p>In the <i>Atlantic</i> for June, 1882, Mr. John Fiske refers <lb/>
to the often-quoted Darwin-and-Wallace "coinci- <lb/>
dence": <lb/>
<q>"I alluded, just now, to the 'unforeseen circumstance' which led Mr. <lb/>
Darwin in 1859 to break his long silence, and to write and publish the <lb/>
<i>Origin of Species</i>. This circumstance served, no less than the extraordinary <lb/>
success of his book, to show how ripe the minds of men had become for <lb/>
entertaining such views as those which Mr. Darwin propounded. In 1858 <lb/>
Mr. Wallace, who was then engaged in studying the natural history of the <lb/>
Malay Archipelago, sent to Mr. Darwin (as the man most likely to under- <lb/>
stand him) a paper in which he sketched the outlines of a theory identical <lb/>
with that upon which Mr. Darwin had so long been at work. The same <lb/>
sequence of observed facts and inferences that had led Mr. Darwin to the <lb/>
discovery of natural selection and its consequences had led Mr. Wallace to <lb/>
the very threshold of the same discovery; but in Mr. Wallace's mind the <lb/>
theory had by no means been wrought out to the same degree of complete- <lb/>
ness to which it had been wrought in the mind of Mr. Darwin. In the <lb/>
preface to his charming book on Natural Selection, Mr. Wallace, with rare <lb/>
modesty and candor, acknowledges that whatever value his speculations <lb/>
may have had, they have been utterly surpassed in richness and cogency of <lb/>
proof by those of Mr. Darwin. This is no doubt true, and Mr. Wallace <lb/>
has done such good work in further illustration of the theory that he can <lb/>
well afford to rest content with the second place in the first announcement <lb/>
of it.</q>
<q>"The coincidence, however, between Mr. Wallace's conclusions and <lb/>
those of Mr. Darwin was very remarkable. But, after all, coincidences of <lb/>
this sort have not been uncommon in the history of scientific inquiry. Nor <lb/>
is it at all surprising that they should occur now and then, when we remem- <lb/>
ber that a great and pregnant discovery must always be concerned with <lb/>
some question which many of the foremost minds in the world are busy <lb/>
thinking about. It was so with the discovery of the differential calculus, <lb/>
and again with the discovery of the planet Neptune. It was so with the <lb/>
interpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and with the establishment of <lb/>
the undulatory theory of light. It was so, to a considerable extent, with <lb/>
the introduction of the new chemistry, with the discovery of the mechanical <lb/>
equivalent of heat, and the whole doctrine of the correlation of forces. It <lb/>
was so with the invention of the electric telegraph and with the discovery of <lb/>
<pb n="382"/>
spectrum analysis. And it is not at all strange that it should have been so <lb/>
with the doctrine of the origin of species through natural selection."</q></p>
<p>He thinks these "coincidences" were apt to happen <lb/>
because the matters from which they sprang were mat- <lb/>
ters which many of the foremost minds in the world <lb/>
were busy thinking about. But perhaps <i>one</i> man in <lb/>
each case did the telegraphing to the others. The <lb/>
aberrations which gave Leverrier the idea that there <lb/>
must be a planet of such and such mass and such and <lb/>
such orbit hidden from sight out yonder in the remote <lb/>
abysses of space were not new; they had been noticed <lb/>
by astronomers for generations. Then why should it <lb/>
happen to occur to three people, widely separated&#x2014; <lb/>
Leverrier, Mrs. Somerville, and Adams&#x2014;to suddenly <lb/>
go to worrying about those aberrations all at the same <lb/>
time, and set themselves to work to find out what <lb/>
caused them, and to measure and weigh an invisible <lb/>
planet, and calculate its orbit, and hunt it down and <lb/>
catch it?&#x2014;a strange project which nobody but they <lb/>
had ever thought of before. If one astronomer had <lb/>
invented that odd and happy project fifty years before, <lb/>
don't you think he would have telegraphed it to several <lb/>
others without knowing it?</p>
<p>But now I come to a puzzler. How is it that <lb/>
<i>inanimate</i> objects are able to affect the mind? They <lb/>
seem to do that. However, I wish to throw in a <lb/>
parenthesis first&#x2014;just a reference to a thing every- <lb/>
body is familiar with&#x2014;the experience of receiving a <lb/>
clear and particular <i>answer</i> to your telegram before <lb/>
your telegram has reached the sender of the answer. <lb/>
That is a case where your telegram has gone straight <lb/>
from your brain to the man it was meant for, far out- <lb/>
stripping the wire's slow electricity, and it is an exer- <lb/>
cise of mental telegraphy which is as common as <lb/>
dining. To return to the influence of inanimate things. <lb/>
In the cases of non-professional clairvoyance examined <lb/>
<pb n="383"/>
by the Psychical Society the clairvoyant has usually <lb/>
been blindfolded, then some object which has been <lb/>
touched or worn by a person is placed in his hand; <lb/>
the clairvoyant immediately describes that person, and <lb/>
goes on and gives a history of some event with which <lb/>
the text object has been connected. If the inanimate <lb/>
object is able to affect and inform the clairvoyant's <lb/>
mind, maybe it can do the same when it is working in <lb/>
the interest of mental telegraphy. Once a lady in the <lb/>
West wrote me that her son was coming to New York <lb/>
to remain three weeks, and would pay me a visit if <lb/>
invited, and she gave me his address. I mislaid the <lb/>
letter, and forgot all about the matter till the three <lb/>
weeks were about up. Then a sudden and fiery irrup- <lb/>
tion of remorse burst up in my brain that illuminated <lb/>
all the region round about, and I sat down at once and <lb/>
wrote to the lady and asked for that lost address. <lb/>
But, upon reflection, I judged that the stirring up of <lb/>
my recollection had not been an accident, so I added a <lb/>
postscript to say, never mind, I should get a letter <lb/>
from her son before night. And I did get it; for the <lb/>
letter was already in the town, although not delivered <lb/>
yet. It had influenced me somehow. I have had so <lb/>
many experiences of this sort&#x2014;a dozen of them at <lb/>
least&#x2014;that I am nearly persuaded that inanimate <lb/>
objects do not confine their activities to helping the <lb/>
clairvoyant, but do every now and then give the mental <lb/>
telegraphist a lift.</p>
<p>The case of mental telegraphy which I am coming <lb/>
to now comes under I don't exactly know what <lb/>
head. I clipped it from one of our local papers <lb/>
six or eight years ago. I know the details to be right <lb/>
and true, for the story was told to me in the same <lb/>
form by one of the two persons concerned (a clergy- <lb/>
man of Hartford) at the time that the curious thing <lb/>
happened: <lb/>
<pb n="384"/>
<q>"<smcap>A Remarkable Coincidence</smcap>.&#x2014;Strange coincidences make the most <lb/>
interesting of stories and most curious of studies. Nobody can quite say <lb/>
how they come about, but everybody appreciates the fact when they do <lb/>
come, and it is seldom that any more complete and curious coincidence is <lb/>
recorded of minor importance than the following, which is absolutely true, <lb/>
and occurred in this city:</q>
<q>"At the time of the building of one of the finest residences of Hartford, <lb/>
which is still a very new house, a local firm supplied the wall-paper for <lb/>
certain rooms, contracting both to furnish and to put on the paper. It <lb/>
happened that they did not calculate the size of one room exactly right, and <lb/>
the paper of the design selected for it fell short just half a roll. They asked <lb/>
for delay enough to send on to the manufacturers for what was needed, and <lb/>
were told that there was no especial hurry. It happened that the manu- <lb/>
facturers had none on hand, and had destroyed the blocks from which it <lb/>
was printed. They wrote that they had a full list of the dealers to whom <lb/>
they had sold that paper, and that they would write to each of these, and <lb/>
get from some of them a roll. It might involve a delay of a couple of <lb/>
weeks, but they would surely get it.</q>
<q>"In the course of time came a letter saying that, to their great surprise, <lb/>
they could not find a single roll. Such a thing was very unusual, but in <lb/>
this case it had so happened. Accordingly the local firm asked for further <lb/>
time, saying they would write to their own customers who had bought of <lb/>
that pattern, and would get the piece from them. But to their surprise, <lb/>
this effort also failed. A long time had now elapsed, and there was no use <lb/>
of delaying any longer. They had contracted to paper the room, and their <lb/>
only course was to take off that which was insufficient and put on some <lb/>
other of which there was enough to go around. Accordingly at length a <lb/>
man was sent out to remove the paper. He got his apparatus ready, and <lb/>
was about to begin to work, under the direction of the owner of the build- <lb/>
ing, when the latter was called away for the moment. The house was large <lb/>
and very interesting, and so many people had rambled about it that finally <lb/>
admission had been refused by a sign at the door. On the occasion, how- <lb/>
ever, when a gentleman had knocked and asked for leave to look about, the <lb/>
owner, being on the premises, had been sent for to reply to the request in <lb/>
person. That was the call that for the moment delayed the final prepara- <lb/>
tions. The gentleman went to the door and admitted the stranger, saying <lb/>
he would show him about the house, but first must return for a moment to <lb/>
that room to finish his directions there, and he told the curious story about <lb/>
the paper as they went on. They entered the room together, and the first <lb/>
thing the stranger, who lived fifty miles away, said on looking about was, <lb/>
<pb n="385"/>
'Why, I have that very paper on a room in my house, and I have an extra <lb/>
roll of it laid away, which is at your service.' In a few days the wall was <lb/>
papered according to the original contract. Had not the owner been at the <lb/>
house, the stranger would not have been admitted; had he called a day <lb/>
later, it would have been too late; had not the facts been almost accidentally <lb/>
told to him, he would probably have said nothing of the paper, and so on. <lb/>
The exact fitting of all the circumstances is something very remarkable, and <lb/>
makes one of those stories that seem hardly accidental in their nature."</q></p>
<p>Something that happened the other day brought my <lb/>
hoary MS. to mind, and that is how I came to dig it <lb/>
out from its dusty pigeon-hole grave for publication. <lb/>
The thing that happened was a question. A lady asked <lb/>
it: "Have you ever had a vision&#x2014;when awake?" I <lb/>
was about to answer promptly, when the last two words <lb/>
of the question began to grow and spread and swell, <lb/>
and presently they attained to vast dimensions. She <lb/>
did not know that they were important; and I did not <lb/>
at first, but I soon saw that they were putting me on <lb/>
the track of the solution of a mystery which had per- <lb/>
plexed me a good deal. You will see what I mean <lb/>
when I get down to it. Ever since the English Society <lb/>
for Psychical Research began its investigations of ghost <lb/>
stories, haunted houses, and apparitions of the living <lb/>
and the dead, I have read their pamphlets with avidity <lb/>
as fast as they arrived. Now one of their commonest <lb/>
inquiries of a dreamer or a vision-seer is, "Are you <lb/>
sure you were awake at the time?" If the man can't <lb/>
say he is sure he was awake, a doubt falls upon his tale <lb/>
right there. But if he is positive he was awake, and <lb/>
offers reasonable evidence to substantiate it, the fact <lb/>
counts largely for the credibility of this story. It does <lb/>
with the society, and it did with me until that lady <lb/>
asked me the above question the other day.</p>
<p>The question set me to considering, and brought me <lb/>
to the conclusion that you can be asleep&#x2014;at least, <lb/>
wholly unconscious&#x2014;for a time, and not suspect that <lb/>
<pb n="386"/>
it has happened, and not have any way to prove that it <lb/>
<i>has</i> happened. A memorable case was in my mind. <lb/>
About a year ago I was standing on the porch one <lb/>
day, when I saw a man coming up the walk. He was <lb/>
a stranger, and I hoped he would ring and carry his <lb/>
business into the house without stopping to argue with <lb/>
me; he would have to pass the front door to get to <lb/>
me, and I hoped he wouldn't take the trouble; to <lb/>
help, I tried to look like a stranger myself&#x2014;it often <lb/>
works. I was looking straight at that man; he had <lb/>
got to within ten feet of the door and within twenty- <lb/>
five feet of me&#x2014;and suddenly he disappeared. It <lb/>
was as astounding as if a church should vanish from <lb/>
before your face and leave nothing behind it but a <lb/>
vacant lot. I was unspeakably delighted. I had seen <lb/>
an apparition at last, with my own eyes, in broad day- <lb/>
light. I made up my mind to write an account of it <lb/>
to the society. I ran to where the specter had been, <lb/>
to make sure he was playing fair, then I ran to the <lb/>
other end of the porch, scanning the open grounds as I <lb/>
went. No, everything was perfect; he couldn't have <lb/>
escaped without my seeing him; he was an apparition, <lb/>
without the slightest doubt, and I would write him up <lb/>
before he was cold. I ran, hot with excitement, and <lb/>
let myself in with a latch-key. When I stepped into <lb/>
the hall my lungs collapsed and my heart stood still. <lb/>
For there sat that same apparition in a chair all alone, <lb/>
and as quiet and reposeful as if he had come to stay a <lb/>
year! The shock kept me dumb for a moment or two, <lb/>
then I said, "Did you come in at that door?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did <i>you</i> open it, or did you ring?"</p>
<p>"I rang, and the colored man opened it."</p>
<p>I said to myself: "This is astonishing. It takes <lb/>
George all of two minutes to answer the door-bell <lb/>
when he is in a hurry, and I have never see him in a <lb/>
<pb n="387"/>
hurry. How <i>did</i> this man stand two minutes at that <lb/>
door, within five steps of me, and I did not see him?"</p>
<p>I should have gone to my grave puzzling over that <lb/>
riddle but for that lady's chance question last week: <lb/>
"Have you ever had a vision&#x2014;when awake?" It <lb/>
stands explained now. During at least sixty seconds <lb/>
that day I was asleep, or at least totally unconscious, <lb/>
without suspecting it. In that interval the man came <lb/>
to my immediate vicinity, rang, stood there and waited, <lb/>
then entered and closed the door, and I did not see <lb/>
him and did not hear the door slam.</p>
<p>If he had slipped around the house in that interval <lb/>
and gone into the cellar&#x2014;he had time enough&#x2014;I <lb/>
should have written him up for the society, and mag- <lb/>
nified him, and gloated over him, and hurrahed about <lb/>
him, and thirty yoke of oxen could not have pulled <lb/>
the belief out of me that I was of the favored ones of <lb/>
the earth, and had seen a vision&#x2014;while wide awake.</p>
<p>Now how are you to tell when you are awake? <lb/>
What are you to go by? People bite their fingers to <lb/>
find out. Why, you can do that in a dream.</p>

<head><b>A CURE FOR THE BLUES</b></head>
<p><smcap>By</smcap> courtesy of Mr. Cable I came into possession of <lb/>
a singular book eight or ten years ago. It is <lb/>
likely that mine is now the only copy in existence. <lb/>
Its title-page, unabbreviated, reads as follows:</p>
<p>"The Enemy Conquered; or, Love Triumphant. <lb/>
By G. Ragsdale McClintock,<ref target="n5">*</ref><note id="n5" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The name here given is a substitute for the one actually attached to <lb/>
the pamphlet.</p></note> author of 'An Address,' <lb/>
etc., delivered at Sunflower Hill, South Carolina, and <lb/>
member of the Yale Law School. New Haven: pub- <lb/>
lished by T. H. Pease, 83 Chapel street, 1845."</p>
<p>No one can take up this book, and lay it down again <lb/>
unread. Whoever reads one line of it is caught, is <lb/>
chained; he has become the contented slave of its <lb/>
fascinations; and he will read and read, devour and <lb/>
devour, and will not let it go out of his hand till it is <lb/>
finished to the last line, though the house be on fire <lb/>
over his head. And after a first reading he will not <lb/>
throw it aside, but will keep it by him, with his <lb/>
Shakespeare and his Homer, and will take it up many <lb/>
and many a time, when the world is dark and his spirits <lb/>
are low, and be straightway cheered and refreshed. <lb/>
Yet this work has been allowed to lie wholly neglected, <lb/>
unmentioned, and apparently unregretted, for nearly <lb/>
half a century.</p>
<p>The reader must not imagine that he is to find in it <lb/>
wisdom, brilliancy, fertility of invention, ingenuity of <lb/>
<pb n="389"/>
construction, excellence of form, purity of style, per- <lb/>
fection of imagery, truth to nature, clearness of state- <lb/>
ment, humanly possible situations, humanly possible <lb/>
people, fluent narrative, connected sequence of events <lb/>
&#x2014;or philosophy, or logic, or sense. No; the rich, <lb/>
deep, beguiling charm of the book lies in the total and <lb/>
miraculous <i>absence</i> from it of all these qualities&#x2014;a <lb/>
charm which is completed and perfected by the evident <lb/>
fact that the author, whose na&#x00EF;ve innocence easily and <lb/>
surely wins our regard, and almost our worship, does <lb/>
not know that they are absent, does not even suspect <lb/>
that they are absent. When read by the light of these <lb/>
helps to an understanding of the situation, the book is <lb/>
delicious&#x2014;profoundly and satisfyingly delicious.</p>
<p>I call it a book because the author calls it a book; I <lb/>
call it a work because he calls it a work; but, in truth, <lb/>
it is merely a duodecimo pamphlet of thirty-one pages. <lb/>
It was written for fame and money, as the author very <lb/>
frankly&#x2014;yes, and very hopefully, too, poor fellow&#x2014; <lb/>
says in his preface. The money never came&#x2014;no <lb/>
penny of it ever came; and how long, how pathetically <lb/>
long, the fame has been deferred&#x2014;forty-seven years! <lb/>
He was young then, it would have been so much to <lb/>
him then; but will he care for it now?</p>
<p>As time is measured in America, McClintock's <lb/>
epoch is antiquity. In his long-vanished day the <lb/>
Southern author had a passion for "eloquence"; it was <lb/>
his pet, his darling. He would be eloquent, or perish. <lb/>
And he recognized only one kind of eloquence&#x2014;the <lb/>
lurid, the tempestuous, the volcanic. He liked words <lb/>
&#x2014;big words, fine words, grand words, rumbling, <lb/>
thundering, reverberating words; with sense attaching <lb/>
if it could be got in without marring the sound, but <lb/>
not otherwise. He loved to stand up before a dazed <lb/>
world, and pour forth flame and smoke and lava and <lb/>
pumice stone into the skies, and work his subterranean <lb/>
<pb n="390"/>
thunders, and shake himself with earthquakes, and <lb/>
stench himself with sulphur fumes. If he consumed <lb/>
his own fields and vineyards, that was a pity, yes; but <lb/>
he would have his eruption at any cost. Mr. Mc- <lb/>
Clintock's eloquence&#x2014;and he is always eloquent, his <lb/>
crater is always spouting&#x2014;is of the pattern common <lb/>
to his day, but he departs from the custom of the time <lb/>
in one respect: his brethren allowed sense to intrude <lb/>
when it did not mar the sound, but he does not allow <lb/>
it to intrude at all. For example, consider this figure, <lb/>
which he uses in the village "Address" referred to <lb/>
with such candid complacency in the title-page above <lb/>
quoted&#x2014;"like the topmost topaz of an ancient <lb/>
tower." Please read it again; contemplate it; meas- <lb/>
ure it; walk around it; climb up it; try to get at an <lb/>
approximate realization of the size of it. Is the fellow <lb/>
to that to be found in literature, ancient or modern, <lb/>
foreign or domestic, living or dead, drunk or sober? <lb/>
One notices how fine and grand it sounds. We know <lb/>
that if it was loftily uttered, it got a noble burst of ap- <lb/>
plause from the villagers; yet there isn't a ray of sense <lb/>
in it, or meaning to it.</p>
<p>McClintock finished his education at Yale in 1843, <lb/>
and came to Hartford on a visit that same year. I <lb/>
have talked with men who at that time talked with him, <lb/>
and felt of him, and knew he was real. One needs to <lb/>
remember that fact and to keep fast hold of it; it is <lb/>
the only way to keep McClintock's book from under- <lb/>
mining one's faith in McClintock's actuality.</p>
<p>As to the book. The first four pages are devoted <lb/>
to an inflamed eulogy of Woman&#x2014;simply Woman in <lb/>
general, or perhaps as an Institution&#x2014;wherein, among <lb/>
other compliments to her details, he pays a unique one <lb/>
to her voice. He says it "fills the breast with fond <lb/>
alarms, echoed by every rill." It sounds well enough, <lb/>
but it is not true. After the eulogy he takes up his <lb/>
<pb n="391"/>
real work and the novel begins. It begins in the <lb/>
woods, near the village of Sunflower Hill.</p>
<q>Brightening clouds seemed to rise from the mist of the fair Chatta- <lb/>
hoochee, to spread their beauty over the thick forest, to guide the hero <lb/>
whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the enemy that would <lb/>
tarnish his name, and to win back the admiration of his long-tried friend.</q>
<p>It seems a general remark, but it is not general; the <lb/>
hero mentioned is the to-be hero of the book; and in <lb/>
this abrupt fashion, and without name or description, <lb/>
he is shoveled into the tale. "With aspirations to <lb/>
conquer the enemy that would tarnish his name" is <lb/>
merely a phrase flung in for the sake of the sound&#x2014; <lb/>
let it not mislead the reader. No one is trying to <lb/>
tarnish this person; no one has thought of it. The <lb/>
rest of the sentence is also merely a phrase; the man <lb/>
has no friend as yet, and of course has had no chance <lb/>
to try him, or win back his admiration, or disturb him <lb/>
in any other way.</p>
<p>The hero climbs up over "Sawney's Mountain," <lb/>
and down the other side, making for an old Indian <lb/>
"castle"&#x2014;which becomes "the red man's hut" in <lb/>
the next sentence; and when he gets there at last, he <lb/>
"surveys with wonder and astonishment" the invisible <lb/>
structure, "which time had buried in the dust; and <lb/>
thought to himself his happiness was not yet com- <lb/>
plete." One doesn't know why it wasn't, nor how <lb/>
near it came to being complete, nor what was still <lb/>
wanting to round it up and make it so. Maybe it was <lb/>
the Indian; but the book does not say. At this point <lb/>
we have an episode: <lb/>
<q>Beside the shore of the brook sat a young man, about eighteen or twenty, <lb/>
who seemed to be reading some favorite book, and who had a remarkably <lb/>
noble countenance&#x2014;eyes which betrayed more than a common mind. <lb/>
This of course made the youth a welcome guest, and gained him friends in <lb/>
whatever condition of life he might be placed. The traveler observed that <lb/>
<pb n="392"/>
he was a well-built figure which showed strength and grace in every move- <lb/>
ment. He accordingly addressed him in quite a gentlemanly manner, and <lb/>
inquired of him the way to the village. After he had received the desired <lb/>
information, and was about taking his leave, the youth said, "Are you not <lb/>
Major Elfonzo, the great musician<ref target="n6">*</ref><note id="n6" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Further on it will be seen that he is a country expert on the fiddle, and <lb/>
has a three-township fame.</p></note>&#x2014;the champion of a noble cause&#x2014;the <lb/>
modern Achilles, who gained so many victories in the Florida War?" "I <lb/>
bear that name," said the Major, "and those titles, trusting at the same <lb/>
time that the ministers of grace will carry me triumphantly through all my <lb/>
laudable undertakings, and if," continued the Major, "you, sir, are the <lb/>
patronizer of noble deeds, I should like to make you my confidant, and <lb/>
learn your address." The youth looked somewhat amazed, bowed low, <lb/>
mused for a moment, and began: "My name is Roswell. I have been <lb/>
recently admitted to the bar, and can only give a faint outline of my future <lb/>
success in that honorable profession; but I trust, sir, like the Eagle, I shall <lb/>
look down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man, and shall ever be <lb/>
ready to give you any assistance in my official capacity, and whatever this <lb/>
muscular arm of mine can do, whenever it shall be called from its buried <lb/>
greatness." The major grasped him by the hand, and exclaimed: "O! <lb/>
thou exalted spirit of inspiration!&#x2014;thou flame of burning prosperity! may <lb/>
the Heaven-directed blaze be the glare of thy soul, and battle down every <lb/>
rampart that seems to impede your progress!"</q></p>
<p>There is a strange sort of originality about Mc- <lb/>
Clintock; he imitates other people's styles, but no- <lb/>
body can imitate his, not even an idiot. Other people <lb/>
can be windy, but McClintock blows a gale; other <lb/>
people can blubber sentiment, but McClintock spews <lb/>
it; other people can mishandle metaphors, but only <lb/>
McClintock knows how to make a business of it. Mc- <lb/>
Clintock is always McClintock, he is always consistent, <lb/>
his style is always his own style. He does not make <lb/>
the mistake of being relevant on one page and <lb/>
irrelevant on another; he is irrelevant on all of them. <lb/>
He does not make the mistake of being lucid in one <lb/>
place and obscure in another; he is obscure all the time. <lb/>
He does not make the mistake of slipping in a name <lb/>
<pb n="393"/>
here and there that is out of character with his work; <lb/>
he always uses names that exactly and fantastically fit his <lb/>
lunatics. In the matter of undeviating consistency he <lb/>
stands alone in authorship. It is this that makes his <lb/>
style unique, and entitles it to a name of its own&#x2014; <lb/>
McClintockian. It is this that protects it from being <lb/>
mistaken for anybody else's. Uncredited quotations <lb/>
from other writers often leave a reader in doubt as to <lb/>
their authorship, but McClintock is safe from that acci- <lb/>
dent; an uncredited quotation from him would always <lb/>
be recognizable. When a boy nineteen years old, who <lb/>
had just been admitted to the bar, says, "I trust, sir, <lb/>
like the Eagle, I shall look down from lofty rocks upon <lb/>
the dwellings of man," we know who is speaking <lb/>
through that boy; we should recognize that note any- <lb/>
where. There be myriads of instruments in this world's <lb/>
literary orchestra, and a multitudinous confusion of <lb/>
sounds that they make, wherein fiddles are drowned, <lb/>
and guitars smothered, and one sort of drum mistaken <lb/>
for another sort; but whensoever the brazen note of <lb/>
the McClintockian trombone breaks through that fog <lb/>
of music, that note is recognizable, and about it there <lb/>
can be no blur of doubt.</p>
<p>The novel now arrives at the point where the Major <lb/>
goes home to see his father. When McClintock wrote <lb/>
this interview, he probably believed it was pathetic.</p>
<q>The road which led to the town presented many attractions. Elfonzo <lb/>
had bid farewell to the youth of deep feeling, and was now wending his way <lb/>
to the dreaming spot of his fondness. The south winds whistled through <lb/>
the woods, as the waters dashed against the banks, as rapid fire in the pent <lb/>
furnace roars. This brought him to remember while alone, that he quietly <lb/>
left behind the hospitality of a father's house, and gladly entered the world, <lb/>
with higher hopes than are often realized. But as he journeyed onward, <lb/>
he was mindful of the advice of his father, who had often looked sadly on <lb/>
the ground, when tears of cruelly deceived hope moistened his eyes. Elfonzo <lb/>
had been somewhat of a dutiful son; yet fond of the amusements of life&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="394"/>
&#x2014;had been in distant lands&#x2014;had enjoyed the pleasure of the world, and <lb/>
had frequently returned to the scenes of his boyhood, almost destitute of <lb/>
many of the comforts of life. In this condition, he would frequently say to <lb/>
his father, "Have I offended you, that you look upon me as a stranger, and <lb/>
frown upon me with stinging looks? Will you not favor me with the sound <lb/>
of your voice? If I have trampled upon your veneration, or have spread a <lb/>
humid veil of darkness around your expectations, send me back into the <lb/>
world, where no heart beats for me&#x2014;where the foot of man has never yet <lb/>
trod; but give me at least one kind word&#x2014;allow me to come into the <lb/>
presence sometimes of thy winter-worn locks." "Forbid it, Heaven, that <lb/>
I should be angry with thee," answered the father, "my son, and yet I <lb/>
send thee back to the children of the world&#x2014;to the cold charity of the <lb/>
combat, and to a land of victory. I read another destiny in thy counte- <lb/>
nance&#x2014;I learn thy inclinations from the flame that has already kindled in <lb/>
my soul a strange sensation. It will seek thee, my dear Elfonzo, it will find <lb/>
thee&#x2014;thou canst not escape that lighted torch, which shall blot out from <lb/>
the remembrance of men a long train of prophecies which they have fore- <lb/>
told against thee. I once thought not so. Once, I was blind; but now <lb/>
the path of life is plain before me, and my sight is clear; yet Elfonzo, <lb/>
return to thy worldly occupation&#x2014;take again in thy hand that chord of <lb/>
sweet sounds&#x2014;struggle with the civilized world, and with your own heart; <lb/>
fly swiftly to the enchanted ground&#x2014;let the night-owl send forth its screams <lb/>
from the stubborn oak&#x2014;let the sea sport upon the beach, and the stars <lb/>
sing together; but learn of these, Elfonzo, thy doom, and thy hiding-place. <lb/>
Our most innocent as well as our most lawful desires must often be denied <lb/>
us, that we may learn to sacrifice them to a Higher will."</q>
<q>Remembering such admonitions with gratitude, Elfonzo was immediately <lb/>
urged by the recollection of his father's family to keep moving.</q>
<p>McClintock has a fine gift in the matter of surprises; <lb/>
but as a rule they are not pleasant ones, they jar upon <lb/>
the feelings. His closing sentence in the last quotation <lb/>
is of that sort. It brings one down out of the tinted <lb/>
clouds in too sudden and collapsed a fashion. It in- <lb/>
censes one against the author for a moment. It makes <lb/>
the reader want to take him by his winter-worn locks, <lb/>
and trample on his veneration, and deliver him over to <lb/>
the cold charity of combat, and blot him out with his <lb/>
own lighted torch. But the feeling does not last. The <lb/>
<pb n="395"/>
master takes again in his hand that concord of sweet <lb/>
sounds of his, and one is reconciled, pacified.</p>
<q>His steps became quicker and quicker&#x2014;he hastened through the piny <lb/>
woods, dark as the forest was, and with joy he very soon reached the little <lb/>
village of repose, in whose bosom rested the boldest chivalry. His close <lb/>
attention to every important object&#x2014;his modest questions about whatever <lb/>
was new to him&#x2014;his reverence for wise old age, and his ardent desire to <lb/>
learn many of the fine arts, soon brought him into respectable notice.</q>
<q>One mild winter day, as he walked along the streets towards the Acad- <lb/>
emy, which stood upon a small eminence, surrounded by native growth&#x2014; <lb/>
some venerable in its appearance, others young and prosperous&#x2014;all seemed <lb/>
inviting, and seemed to be the very place for learning as well as for genius <lb/>
to spend its research beneath its spreading shades. He entered its classic <lb/>
walls in the usual mode of southern manners.</q>
<p>The artfulness of this man! None knows so well as <lb/>
he how to pique the curiosity of the reader&#x2014;and how <lb/>
to disappoint it. He raises the hope, here, that he is <lb/>
going to tell all about how one enters a classic wall in <lb/>
the usual mode of Southern manners; but does he? <lb/>
No; he smiles in his sleeve, and turns aside to other <lb/>
matters.</p>
<q>The principal of the Institution begged him to be seated, and listen to <lb/>
the recitations that were going on. He accordingly obeyed the request, and <lb/>
seemed to be much pleased. After the school was dismissed, and the young <lb/>
hearts regained their freedom, with the songs of the evening, laughing at <lb/>
the anticipated pleasures of a happy home, while others tittered at the <lb/>
actions of the past day, he addressed the teacher in a tone that indicated a <lb/>
resolution&#x2014;with an undaunted mind. He said he had determined to <lb/>
become a student, if he could meet with his approbation. "Sir," said he, "I <lb/>
have spent much time in the world. I have traveled among the uncivilized <lb/>
inhabitants of America. I have met with friends, and combated with foes; <lb/>
but none of these gratify my ambition, or decide what is to be my destiny. <lb/>
I see the learned world have an influence with the voice of the people <lb/>
themselves. The despoilers of the remotest kingdoms of the earth refer <lb/>
their differences to this class of persons. This the illiterate and inexperienced <lb/>
little dream of; and now if you will receive me as I am, with these deficien- <lb/>
cies&#x2014;with all my misguided opinions, I will give you my honor, sir, that I <lb/>
<pb n="396"/>
will never disgrace the Institution, or those who have placed you in this <lb/>
honorable station." The instructor, who had met with many disappoint- <lb/>
ments, knew how to feel for a stranger who had been thus turned upon the <lb/>
charities of an unfeeling community. He looked at him earnestly, and <lb/>
said: "Be of good cheer&#x2014;look forward, sir, to the high destination you <lb/>
may attain. Remember, the more elevated the mark at which you aim, the <lb/>
more sure, the more glorious, the more magnificent the prize." From <lb/>
wonder to wonder, his encouragement led the impatient listener. A strange <lb/>
nature bloomed before him&#x2014;giant streams promised him success&#x2014;gardens <lb/>
of hidden treasures opened to his view. All this, so vividly described, <lb/>
seemed to gain a new witchery from his glowing fancy.</q>
<p>It seems to me that this situation is new in romance. <lb/>
I feel sure it has not been attempted before. Military <lb/>
celebrities have been disguised and set at lowly occu- <lb/>
pations for dramatic effect, but I think McClintock is <lb/>
the first to send one of them to school. Thus, in this <lb/>
book, you pass from wonder to wonder, through gar- <lb/>
dens of hidden treasure, where giant streams bloom <lb/>
before you, and behind you, and all around, and you <lb/>
feel as happy, and groggy, and satisfied, with your <lb/>
quart of mixed metaphor aboard, as you would if it <lb/>
had been mixed in a sample-room, and delivered from <lb/>
a jug.</p>
<p>Now we come upon some more McClintockian sur- <lb/>
prises&#x2014;a sweetheart who is sprung upon us without <lb/>
any preparation, along with a name for her which is <lb/>
even a little more of a surprise than she herself is.</p>
<q>In 1842 he entered the class, and made rapid progress in the English <lb/>
and Latin departments. Indeed, he continued advancing with such rapidity <lb/>
that he was like to become the first in his class, and made such unexpected <lb/>
progress, and was so studious, that he had almost forgotten the pictured <lb/>
saint of his affections. The fresh wreaths of the pine and cypress had <lb/>
waited anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heaven upon the heads of <lb/>
those who had so often poured forth the tender emotions of their souls under <lb/>
its boughs. He was aware of the pleasure that he had seen there. So one <lb/>
evening, as he was returning from his reading, he concluded he would pay <lb/>
a visit to this enchanting spot. Little did he think of witnessing a shadow <lb/>
<pb n="397"/>
of his former happiness, though no doubt, he wished it might be so. He <lb/>
continued sauntering by the roadside, meditating on the past. The nearer <lb/>
he approached the spot, the more anxious he became. At that moment, a <lb/>
tall female figure flitted across his path, with a bunch of roses in her hand; <lb/>
her countenance showed uncommon vivacity, with a resolute spirit; her <lb/>
ivory teeth already appeared as she smiled beautifully, promenading,&#x2014;while <lb/>
her ringlets of hair dangled unconsciously around her snowy neck. Nothing <lb/>
was wanting to complete her beauty. The tinge of the rose was in full <lb/>
bloom upon her cheek; the charms of sensibility and tenderness were always <lb/>
her associates. In Ambulinia's bosom dwelt a noble soul&#x2014;one that never <lb/>
faded&#x2014;one that never was conquered.</q>
<p>Ambulinia! It can hardly be matched in fiction. <lb/>
The full name is Ambulinia Valeer. Marriage will <lb/>
presently round it out and perfect it. Then it <lb/>
will be Mrs. Ambulinia Valeer Elfonzo. It takes the <lb/>
chromo.</p>
<q>Her heart yielded to no feeling but the love of Elfonzo, on whom she <lb/>
gazed with intense delight, and to whom she felt herself more closely bound, <lb/>
because he sought the hand of no other. Elfonzo was roused from his <lb/>
apparent reverie. His books no longer were his inseparable companions&#x2014; <lb/>
his thoughts arrayed themselves to encourage him to the field of victory. <lb/>
He endeavored to speak to his supposed Ambulinia, but his speech appeared <lb/>
not in words. No, his effort was a stream of fire, that kindled his soul into <lb/>
a flame of admiration, and carried his senses away captive. Ambulinia had <lb/>
disappeared, to make him more mindful of his duty. As she walked <lb/>
speedily away through the piny woods, she calmly echoed: "O Elfonzo, <lb/>
thou wilt now look from thy sunbeams. Thou shalt now walk in a new <lb/>
path&#x2014;perhaps thy way leads though darkness; but fear not, the stars fore- <lb/>
tell happiness."</q>
<p>To McClintock that jingling jumble of fine words <lb/>
meant something, no doubt, or seemed to mean some- <lb/>
thing; but it is useless for us to try to divine what it <lb/>
was. Ambulinia comes&#x2014;we don't know whence nor <lb/>
why; she mysteriously intimates&#x2014;we don't know <lb/>
what; and then she goes echoing away&#x2014;we don't <lb/>
know whither; and down comes the curtain. McClin- <lb/>
tock's art is subtle; McClintock's art is deep.</p>
<pb n="398"/>
<q>Not many days afterwards, as surrounded by fragrant flowers, she sat <lb/>
one evening at twilight, to enjoy the cool breeze that whispered notes of <lb/>
melody along the distant groves, the little birds perched on every side, as if <lb/>
to watch the movements of their new visitor. The bells were tolling, when <lb/>
Elfonzo silently stole along by the wild wood flowers, holding in his hand <lb/>
his favorite instrument of music&#x2014;his eye continually searching for Ambu- <lb/>
linia, who hardly seemed to perceive him, as she played carelessly with the <lb/>
songsters that hopped from branch to branch. Nothing could be more <lb/>
striking than the difference between the two. Nature seemed to have given <lb/>
the more tender soul to Elfonzo, and the stronger and more courageous to <lb/>
Ambulinia. A deep feeling spoke from the eyes of Elfonzo&#x2014;such a feel- <lb/>
ing as can only be expressed by those who are blessed as admirers, and by <lb/>
those who are able to return the same with sincerity of heart. He was a <lb/>
few years older than Ambulinia: she had turned a little into her seventeenth. <lb/>
He had almost grown up in the Cherokee country, with the same equal <lb/>
proportions as one of the natives. But little intimacy had existed between <lb/>
them until the year forty-one&#x2014;because the youth felt that the character of <lb/>
such a lovely girl was too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of <lb/>
quiet reverence. But as lovers will not always be insulted, at all times and <lb/>
under all circumstances, by the frowns and cold looks of crabbed old age, <lb/>
which should continually reflect dignity upon those around, and treat the <lb/>
unfortunate as well as the fortunate with a graceful mien, he continued to <lb/>
use diligence and perseverance. All this lighted a spark in his heart that <lb/>
changed his whole character, and like the unyielding Deity that follows the <lb/>
storm to check its rage in the forest, he resolves for the first time to shake <lb/>
off his embarrassment, and return where he had before only worshiped.</q>
<p>At last we begin to get the Major's measure. We <lb/>
are able to put this and that casual fact together, and <lb/>
build the man up before our eyes, and look at him. <lb/>
And after we have got him built, we find him worth the <lb/>
trouble. By the above comparison between his age and <lb/>
Ambulinia's, we guess the war-worn veteran to be <lb/>
twenty-two; and the other facts stand thus: he had <lb/>
grown up in the Cherokee country with the same equal <lb/>
proportions as one of the natives&#x2014;how flowing and <lb/>
graceful the language, and yet how tantalizing as to <lb/>
meaning!&#x2014;he had been turned adrift by his father, to <lb/>
whom he had been "somewhat of a dutiful son"; he <lb/>
<pb n="399"/>
wandered in distant lands; came back frequently "to <lb/>
the scenes of his boyhood, almost destitute of many of <lb/>
the comforts of life," in order to get into the presence <lb/>
of his father's winter-worn locks, and spread a humid <lb/>
veil of darkness around his expectations; but he was <lb/>
always promptly sent back to the cold charity of the <lb/>
combat again; he learned to play the fiddle, and made <lb/>
a name for himself in that line; he had dwelt among <lb/>
the wild tribes; he had philosophized about the de- <lb/>
spoilers of the kingdoms of the earth, and found out&#x2014; <lb/>
the cunning creature&#x2014;that they refer their differences <lb/>
to the learned for settlement; he had achieved a vast <lb/>
fame as a military chieftain, the Achilles of the Florida <lb/>
campaigns, and then had got him a spelling-book and <lb/>
started to school; he had fallen in love with Ambulinia <lb/>
Valeer while she was teething, but had kept it to him- <lb/>
self a while, out of the reverential awe which he felt <lb/>
for the child; but now at last, like the unyielding deity <lb/>
who follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, <lb/>
he resolves to shake off his embarrassment, and to <lb/>
return where before he had only worshiped. The <lb/>
Major, indeed, has made up his mind to rise up and <lb/>
shake his faculties together, and to see if <i>he</i> can't do <lb/>
that thing himself. This is not clear. But no matter <lb/>
about that: there stands the hero, compact and visible; <lb/>
and he is no mean structure, considering that his <lb/>
creator had never created anything before, and hadn't <lb/>
anything but rags and wind to build with this time. It <lb/>
seems to me that no one can contemplate this odd <lb/>
creature, this quaint and curious blatherskite, without <lb/>
admiring McClintock, or, at any rate, loving him and <lb/>
feeling grateful to him; for McClintock made him, he <lb/>
gave him to us; without McClintock we could not <lb/>
have had him, and would now be poor.</p>
<p>But we must come to the feast again. Here is a <lb/>
courtship scene, down there in the romantic glades <lb/>
<pb n="400"/>
among the raccoons, alligators, and things, that has <lb/>
merit, peculiar literary merit. See how Achilles woos. <lb/>
Dwell upon the second sentence (particularly the close <lb/>
of it) and the beginning of the third. Never mind the <lb/>
new personage, Leos, who is intruded upon us un- <lb/>
heralded and unexplained. That is McClintock's way; <lb/>
it is his habit; it is a part of his genius; he cannot <lb/>
help it; he never interrupts the rush of his narrative to <lb/>
make introductions.</p>
<q>It could not escape Ambulinia's penetrating eye that he sought an inter- <lb/>
view with her, which she as anxiously avoided, and assumed a more distant <lb/>
calmness than before, seemingly to destroy all hope. After many efforts <lb/>
and struggles with his own person, with timid steps the Major approached <lb/>
the damsel, with the same caution as he would have done in a field of <lb/>
battle. "Lady Ambulinia," said he tremblingly, "I have long desired a <lb/>
moment like this. I dare not let it escape. I fear the consequences; yet <lb/>
I hope your indulgence will at least hear my petition. Can you not antici- <lb/>
pate what I would say, and what I am about to express? Will you not, like <lb/>
Minerva, who sprung from the brain of Jupiter, release me from thy winding <lb/>
chains or cure me&#x2014;" "Say no more, Elfonzo," answered Ambulinia, <lb/>
with a serious look, raising her hand as if she intended to swear eternal <lb/>
hatred against the whole world; "another lady in my place would have <lb/>
perhaps answered your question in bitter coldness. I know not the little <lb/>
arts of my sex. I care but little for the vanity of those who would chide <lb/>
me, and am unwilling as well as ashamed to be guilty of anything that <lb/>
would lead you to think 'all is not gold that glitters'; so be not rash in your <lb/>
resolution. It is better to repent now than do it in a more solemn hour. <lb/>
Yes, I know what you would say. I know you have a costly gift for me&#x2014; <lb/>
the noblest that man can make&#x2014;your heart! you should not offer it to one <lb/>
so unworthy. Heaven, you know, has allowed my father's house to be <lb/>
made a house of solitude, a home of silent obedience, which my parents say <lb/>
is more to be admired than big names and high-sounding titles. Notwith- <lb/>
standing all this, let me speak the emotions of an honest heart&#x2014;allow me <lb/>
to say in the fullness of my hopes that I anticipate better days. The bird <lb/>
may stretch its wings towards the sun, which it can never reach; and <lb/>
flowers of the field appear to ascend in the same direction, because they <lb/>
cannot do otherwise; but man confides his complaints to the saints in <lb/>
whom he believes; for in their abodes of light they know no more sorrow. <lb/>
<pb n="401"/>
From your confession and indicative looks, I must be that person; if so <lb/>
deceive not yourself."</q>
<q>Elfonzo replied, "Pardon me, my dear madam, for my frankness. I <lb/>
have loved you from my earliest days&#x2014;everything grand and beautiful hath <lb/>
borne the image of Ambulinia; while precipices on every hand surrounded <lb/>
me, your guardian angel stood and beckoned me away from the deep abyss. <lb/>
In every trial, in every misfortune, I have met with your helping hand; yet <lb/>
I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love, till a voice impaired with age <lb/>
encouraged the cause, and declared they who acquired thy favor should win <lb/>
a victory. I saw how Leos worshiped thee. I felt my own unworthiness. <lb/>
I began to know jealousy, a strong guest indeed, in my bosom, yet I could <lb/>
see if I gained your admiration Leos was to be my rival. I was aware that <lb/>
he had the influence of your parents, and the wealth of a deceased relative, <lb/>
which are too often mistaken for permanent and regular tranquility; yet <lb/>
I have determined by your permission to beg an interest in your prayers&#x2014; <lb/>
to ask you to animate my drooping spirits by your smiles and your winning <lb/>
looks; for, if you but speak, I shall be conqueror, my enemies shall stagger <lb/>
like Olympus shakes. And though earth and sea may tremble, and the <lb/>
charioteer of the sun may forget his dashing steed, yet I am assured that it <lb/>
is only to arm me with divine weapons, which will enable me to complete <lb/>
my long-tried intention." "Return to yourself, Elfonzo," said Ambulinia, <lb/>
pleasantly; "a dream of vision has disturbed your intellect; you are above <lb/>
the atmosphere, dwelling in the celestial regions; nothing is there that urges <lb/>
or hinders, nothing that brings discord into our present litigation. I entreat <lb/>
you to condescend a little, and be a man, and forget it all. When Homer <lb/>
describes the battle of the gods and noble men, fighting with giants and <lb/>
dragons, they represent under this image our struggles with the delusions of <lb/>
our passions. You have exalted me, an unhappy girl, to the skies; you <lb/>
have called me a saint, and portrayed in your imagination an angel in human <lb/>
form. Let her remain such to you, let her continue to be as you have sup- <lb/>
posed, and be assured that she will consider a share in your esteem as her <lb/>
highest treasure. Think not that I would allure you from the path in which <lb/>
your conscience leads you; for you know I respect the conscience of others, <lb/>
as I would die for my own. Elfonzo, if I am worthy of thy love, let such <lb/>
conversation never again pass between us. Go, seek a nobler theme! we <lb/>
will seek it in the stream of time, as the sun set in the Tigris." As she <lb/>
spake these words she grasped the hand of Elfonzo, saying at the same time <lb/>
&#x2014;"Peace and prosperity attend you, my hero; be up and doing." Closing <lb/>
her remarks with this expression, she walked slowly away, leaving Elfonzo <lb/>
<pb n="402"/>
astonished and amazed. He ventured not to follow or detain her. Here <lb/>
he stood alone, gazing at the stars; confounded as he was, here he stood.</q>
<p>Yes; there he stood. There seems to be no doubt <lb/>
about that. Nearly half of this delirious story has now <lb/>
been delivered to the reader. It seems a pity to reduce <lb/>
the other half to a cold synopsis. Pity! it is more <lb/>
than a pity, it is a crime; for to synopsize McClintock <lb/>
is to reduce a sky-flushing conflagration to dull embers, <lb/>
it is to reduce barbaric splendor to ragged poverty. <lb/>
McClintock never wrote a line that was not precious; <lb/>
he never wrote one that could be spared; he never <lb/>
framed one from which a word could be removed with- <lb/>
out damage. Every sentence that this master has pro- <lb/>
duced may be likened to a perfect set of teeth, white, <lb/>
uniform, beautiful. If you pull one, the charm is <lb/>
gone.</p>
<p>Still, it is now necessary to begin to pull, and to <lb/>
keep it up; for lack of space requires us to synopsize.</p>
<p>We left Elfonzo standing there amazed. At what, <lb/>
we do not know. Not at the girl's speech. No; we <lb/>
ourselves should have been amazed at it, of course, for <lb/>
none of us has ever heard anything resembling it; but <lb/>
Elfonzo was used to speeches made up of noise and <lb/>
vacancy, and could listen to them with undaunted mind <lb/>
like the "topmost topaz of an ancient tower"; he <lb/>
was used to making them himself; he&#x2014;but let it go, <lb/>
it cannot be guessed out; we shall never know what it <lb/>
was that astonished him. He stood there awhile; then <lb/>
he said, "Alas! am I now Grief's disappointed son at <lb/>
last?" He did not stop to examine his mind, and to <lb/>
try to find out what he probably meant by that, be- <lb/>
cause, for one reason, "a mixture of ambition and <lb/>
greatness of soul moved upon his young heart," and <lb/>
started him for the village. He resumed his bench in <lb/>
school, "and reasonably progressed in his education." <lb/>
His heart was heavy, but he went into society, and <lb/>
<pb n="403"/>
sought surcease of sorrow in its light distractions. He <lb/>
made himself popular with his violin, "which seemed <lb/>
to have a thousand chords&#x2014;more symphonious than <lb/>
the Muses of Apollo, and more enchanting than the <lb/>
ghost of the Hills." This is obscure, but let it go.</p>
<p>During this interval Leos did some unencouraged <lb/>
courting, but at last, "choked by his undertaking," <lb/>
he desisted.</p>
<p>Presently "Elfonzo again wends his way to the <lb/>
stately walls and new-built village." He goes to the <lb/>
house of his beloved; she opens the door herself. To <lb/>
my surprise&#x2014;for Ambulinia's heart had still seemed <lb/>
free at the time of their last interview&#x2014;love beamed <lb/>
from the girl's eyes. One sees that Elfonzo was sur- <lb/>
prised, too; for when he caught that light, "a halloo <lb/>
of smothered shouts ran through every vein." A neat <lb/>
figure&#x2014;a very neat figure, indeed! Then he kissed <lb/>
her. "The scene was overwhelming." They went <lb/>
into the parlor. The girl said it was safe, for her <lb/>
parents were abed, and would never know. Then we <lb/>
have this fine picture&#x2014;flung upon the canvas with <lb/>
hardly an effort, as you will notice.</p>
<q>Advancing towards him she gave a bright display of her rosy neck, and <lb/>
from her head the ambrosial locks breathed divine fragrance; her robe hung <lb/>
waving to his view, while she stood like a goddess confessed before him.</q>
<p>There is nothing of interest in the couple's interview. <lb/>
Now at this point the girl invites Elfonzo to a village <lb/>
show, where jealousy is the motive of the play, for she <lb/>
wants to teach him a wholesome lesson, if he is a jeal- <lb/>
ous person. But this is a sham, and pretty shallow. <lb/>
McClintock merely wants a pretext to drag in a <lb/>
plagiarism of his upon a scene or two in "Othello."</p>
<p>The lovers went to the play. Elfonzo was one of <lb/>
the fiddlers. He and Ambulinia must not be seen <lb/>
together, lest trouble follow with the girl's malignant <lb/>
<pb n="404"/>
father; we are made to understand that clearly. So <lb/>
the two sit together in the orchestra, in the midst of <lb/>
the musicians. This does not seem to be good art. <lb/>
In the first place, the girl would be in the way, for <lb/>
orchestras are always packed closely together, and <lb/>
there is no room to spare for people's girls; in the <lb/>
next place, one cannot conceal a girl in an orchestra <lb/>
without everybody taking notice of it. There can be <lb/>
no doubt, it seems to me, that this is bad art.</p>
<p>Leos is present. Of course, one of the first things <lb/>
that catches his eye is the maddening spectacle of <lb/>
Ambulinia "leaning upon Elfonzo's chair." This <lb/>
poor girl does not seem to understand even the rudi- <lb/>
ments of concealment. But she is "in her seven- <lb/>
teenth," as the author phrases it, and that is her <lb/>
justification.</p>
<p>Leos meditates, constructs a plan&#x2014;with personal <lb/>
violence as a basis, of course. It was their way down <lb/>
there. It is a good plain plan, without any imagina- <lb/>
tion in it. He will go out and stand at the front door, <lb/>
and when these two come out he will "arrest Ambu- <lb/>
linia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo," and <lb/>
thus make for himself a "more prosperous field of <lb/>
immortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence, or <lb/>
ever pencil drew or artist imagined." But, dear me, <lb/>
while he is waiting there the couple climb out at the <lb/>
back window and scurry home! This is romantic <lb/>
enough, but there is a lack of dignity in the situation.</p>
<p>At this point McClintock puts in the whole of his <lb/>
curious play&#x2014;which we skip.</p>
<p>Some correspondence follows now. The bitter father <lb/>
and the distressed lovers write the letters. Elopements <lb/>
are attempted. They are idiotically planned, and they <lb/>
fail. Then we have several pages of romantic powwow <lb/>
and confusion signifying nothing. Another elopement <lb/>
is planned; it is to take place on Sunday, when every- <lb/>
<pb n="405"/>
body is at church. But the "hero" cannot keep the <lb/>
secret; he tells everybody. Another author would <lb/>
have found another instrument when he decided to de- <lb/>
feat this elopement; but that is not McClintock's way. <lb/>
He uses the person that is nearest at hand.</p>
<p>The evasion failed, of course. Ambulinia, in her <lb/>
flight, takes refuge in a neighbor's house. Her father <lb/>
drags her home. The villagers gather, attracted by the <lb/>
racket.</p>
<q>Elfonzo was moved at this sight. The people followed on to see what <lb/>
was going to become of Ambulinia, while he, with downcast looks, kept at <lb/>
a distance, until he saw them enter the abode of the father, thrusting her, <lb/>
that was the sigh of his soul, out of his presence into a solitary apart- <lb/>
ment, when she exclaimed, "Elfonzo! Elfonzo! oh, Elfonzo! where art <lb/>
thou, with all thy heroes? haste, oh! haste, come thou to my relief. Ride <lb/>
on the wings of the wind! Turn thy force loose like a tempest, and roll on <lb/>
thy army like a whirlwind, over this mountain of trouble and confusion. <lb/>
Oh, friends! if any pity me, let your last efforts throng upon the green <lb/>
hills, and come to the relief of Ambulinia, who is guilty of nothing but <lb/>
innocent love." Elfonzo called out with a loud voice, "My God, can I <lb/>
stand this! arouse up, I beseech you, and put an end to this tyranny. <lb/>
Come, my brave boys," said he, "are you ready to go forth to your duty?" <lb/>
They stood around him. "Who," said he, "will call us to arms? Where <lb/>
are my thunderbolts of war? Speak ye, the first who will meet the foe! <lb/>
Who will go forth with me in this ocean of grievous temptation? If there <lb/>
is one who desires to go, let him come and shake hands upon the altar of <lb/>
devotion, and swear that he will be a hero; yes, a Hector in a cause like <lb/>
this, which calls aloud for a speedy remedy." "Mine be the deed," said a <lb/>
young lawyer, "and mine alone; Venus alone shall quit her station before <lb/>
I will forsake one jot or tittle of my promise to you; what is death to me? <lb/>
what is all this warlike army, if it is not to win a victory? I love the sleep <lb/>
of the lover and the mighty; nor would I give it over till the blood of my <lb/>
enemies should wreak with that of my own. But God forbid that our fame <lb/>
should soar on the blood of the slumberer." Mr. Valeer stands at his door <lb/>
with the frown of a demon upon his brow, with his dangerous weapon<ref target="n7">*</ref><note id="n7" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>It is a crowbar.</p></note> <lb/>
ready to strike the first man who should enter his door. "Who will arise <lb/>
<pb n="406"/>
and go forward through blood and carnage to the rescue of my Ambulinia?" <lb/>
said Elfonzo. "All," exclaimed the multitude; and onward they went, <lb/>
with their implements of battle. Others, of a more timid nature, stood <lb/>
among the distant hills to see the result of the contest.</q>
<p>It will hardly be believed that after all this thunder <lb/>
and lightning not a drop of rain fell; but such is the <lb/>
fact. Elfonzo and his gang stood up and blackguarded <lb/>
Mr. Valeer with vigor all night, getting their outlay <lb/>
back with interest; then in the early morning the army <lb/>
and its general retired from the field, leaving the victory <lb/>
with their solitary adversary and his crowbar. This is <lb/>
the first time this has happened in romantic literature. <lb/>
The invention is original. Everything in this book is <lb/>
original; there is nothing hackneyed about it any- <lb/>
where. Always, in other romances, when you find the <lb/>
author leading up to a climax, you know what is going <lb/>
to happen. But in this book it is different; the thing <lb/>
which seems inevitable and unavoidable never happens; <lb/>
it is circumvented by the art of the author every time.</p>
<p>Another elopement was attempted. It failed.</p>
<p>We have now arrived at the end. But it is not ex- <lb/>
citing. McClintock thinks it is; but it isn't. One day <lb/>
Elfonzo sent Ambulinia another note&#x2014;a note pro- <lb/>
posing elopement No. 16. This time the plan is ad- <lb/>
mirable; admirable, sagacious, ingenious, imaginative, <lb/>
deep&#x2014;oh, everything, and perfectly easy. One won- <lb/>
ders why it was never thought of before. This is the <lb/>
scheme. Ambulinia is to leave the breakfast table, <lb/>
ostensibly to "attend to the placing of those flowers, <lb/>
which ought to have been done a week ago"&#x2014;artifi- <lb/>
cial ones, of course; the others wouldn't keep so long <lb/>
&#x2014;and then, instead of fixing the flowers, she is to <lb/>
walk out of the grove, and go off with Elfonzo. The <lb/>
invention of this plan overstrained the author, that is <lb/>
plain, for he straightway shows failing powers. The <lb/>
details of the plan are not many or elaborate. The <lb/>
<pb n="407"/>
author shall state them himself&#x2014;this good soul, whose <lb/>
intentions are always better than his English: <lb/>
<q>You walk carelessly towards the academy grove, where you will find me <lb/>
with a lightning steed, elegantly equipped to bear you off where we shall be <lb/>
joined in wedlock with the first connubial rights.</q></p>
<p>Last scene of all, which the author, now much en- <lb/>
feebled, tries to smarten up and make acceptable to his <lb/>
spectacular heart by introducing some new properties <lb/>
&#x2014;silver bow, golden harp, olive branch&#x2014;things that <lb/>
can all come good in an elopement, no doubt, yet are <lb/>
not to be compared to an umbrella for real handiness <lb/>
and reliability in an excursion of that kind.</p>
<q>And away she ran to the sacred grove, surrounded with glittering pearls, <lb/>
that indicated her coming. Elfonzo hails her with his silver bow and his <lb/>
golden harp. They meet&#x2014;Ambulinia's countenance brightens&#x2014;Elfonzo <lb/>
leads up the winged steed. "Mount," said he, "ye true hearted, ye fear- <lb/>
less soul&#x2014;the day is ours." She sprang upon the back of the young <lb/>
thunderbolt, a brilliant star sparkles upon her head, with one hand she <lb/>
grasps the reins, and with the other she holds an olive branch. "Lend thy <lb/>
aid, ye strong winds," they exclaimed, "ye moon, ye sun, and all ye fair <lb/>
host of heaven, witness the enemy conquered." "Hold," said Elfonzo, <lb/>
"thy dashing steed." "Ride on," said Ambulinia, "the voice of thunder <lb/>
is behind us." And onward they went, with such rapidity, that they very <lb/>
soon arrived at Rural Retreat, where they dismounted, and were united <lb/>
with all the solemnities that usually attend such divine operations.</q>
<p>There is but one Homer, there is but one Shakes- <lb/>
peare, there is but one McClintock&#x2014;and his immortal <lb/>
book is before you. Homer could not have written <lb/>
this book, Shakespeare could not have written it, I <lb/>
could not have done it myself. There is nothing just <lb/>
like it in the literature of any country or of any epoch. <lb/>
It stands alone; it is monumental. It adds G. Rags- <lb/>
dale McClintock's to the sum of the republic's im- <lb/>
perishable names.</p>

<p><smcap>I begin</smcap> this little work with an eulogy upon woman, <lb/>
who has ever been distinguished for her persever- <lb/>
ance, her constancy, and her devoted attention to those <lb/>
upon whom she has been pleased to place her <i>affec- <lb/>
tions</i>. Many have been the themes upon which writers <lb/>
and public speakers have dwelt with intense and in- <lb/>
creasing interest. Among these delightful themes <lb/>
stands that of woman, the balm to all our sighs and <lb/>
disappointments, and the most pre-eminent of all other <lb/>
topics. Here the poet and orator have stood and <lb/>
gazed with wonder and with admiration; they have <lb/>
dwelt upon her innocence, the ornament of all her <lb/>
virtues. First viewing her external charms, such as <lb/>
are set forth in her form and her benevolent counte- <lb/>
nance, and then passing to the deep hidden springs of <lb/>
loveliness and disinterested devotion. In every clime, <lb/>
<pb n="409"/>
and in every age, she has been the pride of her <i>nation</i>. <lb/>
Her watchfulness is untiring; she who guarded the <lb/>
sepulcher was the first to approach it, and the last <lb/>
to depart from its awful yet sublime scene. Even <lb/>
here, in this highly favored land, we look to her for <lb/>
the security of our institutions and for our future <lb/>
greatness as a nation. But, strange as it may appear, <lb/>
woman's charms and virtues are but slightly appreciated <lb/>
by thousands. Those who should raise the standard <lb/>
of female worth, and paint her value with her virtues, <lb/>
in living colors, upon the banners that are fanned by <lb/>
the zephyrs of heaven, and hand them down to pos- <lb/>
terity as emblematical of a rich inheritance, do not <lb/>
properly estimate them.</p>
<p>Man is not sensible, at all times, of the nature and <lb/>
the emotions which bear that name; he does not <lb/>
understand, he will not comprehend; his intelligence <lb/>
has not expanded to that degree of glory which drinks <lb/>
in the vast revolution of humanity, its end, its mighty <lb/>
destination, and the causes which operated, and are <lb/>
still operating, to produce a more elevated station, and <lb/>
the objects which energize and enliven its consumma- <lb/>
tion. This he is a stranger to; he is not aware that <lb/>
woman is the recipient of celestial love, and that man <lb/>
is dependent upon her to perfect his character; that <lb/>
without her, philosophically and truly speaking, the <lb/>
brightest of his intelligence is but the coldness of a <lb/>
winter moon, whose beams can produce no fruit, whose <lb/>
solar light is not its own, but borrowed from the great <lb/>
dispenser of effulgent beauty. We have no disposition <lb/>
in the world to flatter the fair sex, we would raise them <lb/>
above those dastardly principles which only exist in <lb/>
little souls, contracted hearts, and a distracted brain. <lb/>
Often does she unfold herself in all her fascinating <lb/>
loveliness, presenting the most captivating charms; yet <lb/>
we find man frequently treats such purity of purpose <lb/>
<pb n="410"/>
with indifference. Why does he do it? Why does he <lb/>
baffle that which is inevitably the source of his better <lb/>
days? Is he so much of a stranger to those excellent <lb/>
qualities as not to appreciate woman, as not to have <lb/>
respect to her dignity? Since her art and beauty first <lb/>
captivated man, she has been his delight and his com- <lb/>
fort; she has shared alike in his misfortunes and in his <lb/>
prosperity.</p>
<p>Whenever the billows of adversity and the tumultu- <lb/>
ous waves of trouble beat high, her smiles subdue their <lb/>
fury. Should the tear of sorrow and the mournful <lb/>
sigh of grief interrupt the peace of his mind, her voice <lb/>
removes them all, and she bends from her circle to <lb/>
encourage him onward. When darkness would obscure <lb/>
his mind, and a thick cloud of gloom would bewilder <lb/>
its operations, her intelligent eye darts a ray of stream- <lb/>
ing light into his heart. Mighty and charming is that <lb/>
disinterested devotion which she is ever ready to exer- <lb/>
cise towards man, not waiting till the last moment of <lb/>
his danger, but seeks to relieve him in his early afflic- <lb/>
tions. It gushes forth from the expansive fullness of a <lb/>
tender and devoted heart, where the noblest, the purest, <lb/>
and the most elevated and refined feelings are matured <lb/>
and developed in those many kind offices which invari- <lb/>
ably make her character.</p>
<p>In the room of sorrow and sickness, this unequaled <lb/>
characteristic may always be seen in the performance <lb/>
of the most charitable acts; nothing that she can do to <lb/>
promote the happiness of him who she claims to be <lb/>
her protector will be omitted; all is invigorated by the <lb/>
animating sunbeams which awaken the heart to songs <lb/>
of gayety. Leaving this point, to notice another <lb/>
prominent consideration, which is generally one of <lb/>
great moment and of vital importance. Invariably she <lb/>
is firm and steady in all her pursuits and aims. There <lb/>
is required a combination of forces and extreme oppo- <lb/>
<pb n="411"/>
sition to drive her from her position; she takes her <lb/>
stand, not to be moved by the sound of Apollo's lyre, <lb/>
or the curved bow of pleasure.</p>
<p>Firm and true to what she undertakes, and that <lb/>
which she requires by her own aggrandizement, and <lb/>
regards as being within the strict rules of propriety, <lb/>
she will remain stable and unflinching to the last. A <lb/>
more genuine principle is not to be found in the most <lb/>
determined, resolute heart of man. For this she de- <lb/>
serves to be held in the highest commendation, for this <lb/>
she deserves the purest of all other blessings, and for <lb/>
this she deserves the most laudable reward of all others. <lb/>
It is a noble characteristic, and is worthy the imitation <lb/>
of any age. And when we look at it in one particular <lb/>
aspect, it is still magnified, and grows brighter and <lb/>
brighter the more we reflect upon its eternal duration. <lb/>
What will she not do, when her word as well as her <lb/>
affections and <i>love</i> are pledged to her lover? Every- <lb/>
thing that is dear to her on earth, all the hospitalities <lb/>
of kind and loving parents, all the sincerity and loveli- <lb/>
ness of sisters, and the benevolent devotion of brothers, <lb/>
who have surrounded her with every comfort; she will <lb/>
forsake them all, quit the harmony and sweet sound of <lb/>
the lute and the harp, and throw herself upon the <lb/>
affections of some devoted admirer, in whom she iondly <lb/>
hopes to find more than she has left behind, which is <lb/>
not often realized by many. Truth and virtue all <lb/>
combined! How deserving our admiration and love! <lb/>
Ah! cruel would it be in man, after she has thus mani- <lb/>
fested such an unshaken confidence in him, and said <lb/>
by her determination to abandon all the endearments <lb/>
and blandishments of home, to act a villainous part, <lb/>
and prove a traitor in the revolution of his mission, <lb/>
and then turn Hector over the innocent victim whom <lb/>
he swore to protect, in the presence of Heaven, <lb/>
recorded by the pen of an angel.</p>
<pb n="412"/>
<p>Striking as this trait may unfold itself in her char- <lb/>
acter, and as pre-eminent as it may stand among the <lb/>
fair display of her other qualities, yet there is another, <lb/>
which struggles into existence, and adds an additional <lb/>
luster to what she already possesses. I mean that dis- <lb/>
position in woman which enables her, in sorrow, in <lb/>
grief, and in distress, to bear all with enduring patience. <lb/>
This she has done, and can and will do, amid the din <lb/>
of war and clash of arms. Scenes and occurrences <lb/>
which, to every appearance, are calculated to rend the <lb/>
heart with the profoundest emotions of trouble, do <lb/>
not fetter that exalted principle imbued in her very <lb/>
nature. It is true, her tender and feeling heart may <lb/>
often be moved (as she is thus constituted), but still <lb/>
she is not conquered, she has not given up to the <lb/>
harlequin of disappointments, her energies have not <lb/>
become clouded in the last moment of misfortune, but <lb/>
she is continually invigorated by the archetype of her <lb/>
affections. She may bury her face in her hands, and <lb/>
let the tear of anguish roll, she may promenade the <lb/>
delightful walks of some garden, decorated with all the <lb/>
flowers of nature, or she may steal out along some <lb/>
gently rippling stream, and there, as the silver waters <lb/>
uninterruptedly move forward, shed her silent tears; <lb/>
they mingle with the waves, and take a last farewell of <lb/>
their agitated home, to seek a peaceful dwelling among <lb/>
the rolling floods; yet there is a voice rushing from <lb/>
her breast, that proclaims <i>victory</i> along the whole line <lb/>
and battlement of her affections. That voice is the <lb/>
voice of patience and resignation; that voice is one <lb/>
that bears everything calmly and dispassionately, amid <lb/>
the most distressing scenes, when the fates are arrayed <lb/>
against her peace, and apparently plotting for her <lb/>
destruction, still she is resigned.</p>
<p>Woman's affections are deep, consequently her <lb/>
troubles may be made to sink deep. Although you <lb/>
<pb n="413"/>
may not be able to mark the traces of her grief and the <lb/>
furrowings of her anguish upon her winning counte- <lb/>
nance, yet be assured they are nevertheless preying <lb/>
upon her inward person, sapping the very foundation <lb/>
of that heart which alone was made for the weal and <lb/>
not the woe of man. The deep recesses of the soul <lb/>
are fields for their operation. But they are not <lb/>
destined simply to take the regions of the heart for <lb/>
their dominion, they are not satisfied merely with inter- <lb/>
rupting her better feelings; but after a while you may <lb/>
see the blooming cheek beginning to droop and fade, <lb/>
her intelligent eye no longer sparkles with the starry <lb/>
light of heaven, her vibrating pulse long since changed <lb/>
its regular motion, and her palpitating bosom beats <lb/>
once more for the midday of her glory. Anxiety and <lb/>
care ultimately throw her into the arms of the haggard <lb/>
and grim monster death. But, oh, how patient, under <lb/>
every pining influence! Let us view the matter in <lb/>
bolder colors; see her when the dearest object of her <lb/>
affections recklessly seeks every bacchanalian pleasure, <lb/>
contents himself with the last rubbish of creation. <lb/>
With what solicitude she awaits his return! Sleep <lb/>
fails to perform its office&#x2014;she weeps while the noc- <lb/>
turnal shades of the night triumph in the stillness. <lb/>
Bending over some favorite book, while the author <lb/>
throws before her mind the most beautiful imagery, <lb/>
she startles at every sound. The midnight silence is <lb/>
broken by the solemn announcement of the return of <lb/>
another morning. He is still absent; she listens for <lb/>
that voice which has so often been greeted by the <lb/>
melodies of her own; but, alas! stern silence is all <lb/>
that she receives for her vigilance.</p>
<p>Mark her unwearied watchfulness, as the night passes <lb/>
away. At last, brutalized by the accursed thing, he <lb/>
staggers along with rage, and, shivering with cold, he <lb/>
makes his appearance. Not a murmur is heard from <lb/>
<pb n="414"/>
her lips. On the contrary, she meets him with a <lb/>
smile&#x2014;she caresses him with her tender arms, with <lb/>
all the gentleness and softness of her sex. Here, then, <lb/>
is seen her disposition, beautifully arrayed. Woman, <lb/>
thou art more to be admired than the spicy gales of <lb/>
Arabia, and more sought for than the gold of Gol- <lb/>
conda. We believe that Woman should associate freely <lb/>
with man, and we believe that it is for the preservation <lb/>
of her rights. She should become acquainted with the <lb/>
metaphysical designs of those who condescend to sing <lb/>
the siren song of flattery. This, we think, should be <lb/>
according to the unwritten law of decorum, which is <lb/>
stamped upon every innocent heart. The precepts of <lb/>
prudery are often steeped in the guilt of contamination, <lb/>
which blasts the expectations of better moments. <lb/>
Truth, and beautiful dreams&#x2014;loveliness, and delicacy <lb/>
of character, with cherished affections of the ideal <lb/>
woman&#x2014;gentle hopes and aspirations, are enough to <lb/>
uphold her in the storms of darkness, without the <lb/>
transferred colorings of a stained sufferer. How often <lb/>
have we seen it in our public prints, that woman occu- <lb/>
pies a false station in the world! and some have gone <lb/>
so far as to say it was an unnatural one. So long has <lb/>
she been regarded a weak creature, by the rabble and <lb/>
illiterate&#x2014;they have looked upon her as an insufficient <lb/>
actress on the great stage of human life&#x2014;a mere <lb/>
puppet, to fill up the drama of human existence&#x2014;a <lb/>
thoughtless, inactive being&#x2014;that she has too often <lb/>
come to the same conclusion herself, and has some- <lb/>
times forgotten her high destination, in the meridian of <lb/>
her glory. We have but little sympathy or patience <lb/>
for those who treat her as a mere Rosy Melindi&#x2014;who <lb/>
are always fishing for pretty compliments&#x2014;who are <lb/>
satisfied by the gossamer of Romance, and who can be <lb/>
allured by the verbosity of high-flown words, rich in <lb/>
language, but poor and barren in sentiment. Beset, as <lb/>
<pb n="415"/>
she has been, by the intellectual vulgar, the selfish, the <lb/>
designing, the cunning, the hidden, and the artful&#x2014; <lb/>
no wonder she has sometimes folded her wings in <lb/>
despair, and forgotten her <i>heavenly</i> mission in the <lb/>
delirium of imagination; no wonder she searches out <lb/>
some wild desert, to find a peaceful home. But this <lb/>
cannot always continue. A new era is moving gently <lb/>
onward, old things are rapidly passing away; old <lb/>
superstitions, old prejudices, and old notions are now <lb/>
bidding farewell to their old associates and companions, <lb/>
and giving way to one whose wings are plumed with <lb/>
the light of heaven, and tinged by the dews of the <lb/>
morning. There is a remnant of blessedness that clings <lb/>
to her in spite of all evil influence, there is enough of <lb/>
the Divine Master left, to accomplish the noblest work <lb/>
ever achieved under the canopy of the vaulted skies; <lb/>
and that time is fast approaching, when the picture of <lb/>
the true woman will shine from its frame of glory, to <lb/>
captivate, to win back, to restore, and to call into <lb/>
being once more, <i>the object of her mission</i>.</p>

<l>Star of the brave! thy glory shed,</l>

<p>Mighty and glorious are the days of youth; happy <lb/>
the moments of the <i>lover</i>, mingled with smiles and <lb/>
tears of his devoted, and long to be remembered are <lb/>
the achievements which he gains with a palpitating <lb/>
heart and a trembling hand. A bright and lovely <lb/>
dawn, the harbinger of a fair and prosperous day, had <lb/>
arisen over the beautiful little village of Cumming, <lb/>
which is surrounded by the most romantic scenery in <lb/>
the Cherokee country. Brightening clouds seemed to <lb/>
rise from the mist of the fair Chattahoochee, to spread <lb/>
their beauty over the thick forest, to guide the hero <lb/>
<pb n="416"/>
whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the <lb/>
enemy that would tarnish his name, and to win back <lb/>
the admiration of his long-tried friend. He endeavored <lb/>
to make his way through Sawney's Mountain, where <lb/>
many meet to catch the gales that are continually <lb/>
blowing for the refreshment of the stranger and the <lb/>
traveler. Surrounded as he was by hills on every side, <lb/>
naked rocks dared the efforts of his energies. Soon <lb/>
the sky became overcast, the sun buried itself in the <lb/>
clouds, and the fair day gave place to gloomy twilight, <lb/>
which lay heavily on the Indian Plains. He remem- <lb/>
bered an old Indian castle that once stood at the foot <lb/>
of the mountain. He thought if he could make his <lb/>
way to this, he would rest contented for a short time. <lb/>
The mountain air breathed fragrance&#x2014;a rosy tinge <lb/>
rested on the glassy waters that murmured at its base. <lb/>
His resolution soon brought him to the remains of the <lb/>
red man's hut; he surveyed with wonder and astonish- <lb/>
ment the decayed building, which time had buried in <lb/>
the dust, and thought to himself, his happiness was not <lb/>
yet complete. Beside the shore of the brook sat a <lb/>
young man, about eighteen or twenty, who seemed to <lb/>
be reading some favorite book, and who had a remark- <lb/>
ably noble countenance&#x2014;eyes which betrayed more <lb/>
than a common mind. This, of course, made the <lb/>
youth a welcome guest, and gained him friends in <lb/>
whatever condition of life he might be placed. The <lb/>
traveler observed that he was a well-built figure, which <lb/>
showed strength and grace in every movement. He <lb/>
accordingly addressed him in quite a gentlemanly <lb/>
manner, and inquired of him the way to the village. <lb/>
After he had received the desired information, and <lb/>
was about taking his leave, the youth said, "Are you <lb/>
not Major Elfonzo, the great musician&#x2014;the champion <lb/>
of a noble cause&#x2014;the modern Achilles, who gained <lb/>
so many victories in the Florida War?" "I bear that <lb/>
<pb n="417"/>
name," said the Major, "and those titles, trusting at <lb/>
the same time that the ministers of grace will carry <lb/>
me triumphantly through all my laudable undertak- <lb/>
ings, and if," continued the Major, "you, sir, are the <lb/>
patronizer of noble deeds, I should like to make you <lb/>
my confidant, and learn your address." The youth <lb/>
looked somewhat amazed, bowed low, mused for a <lb/>
moment, and began: "My name is Roswell. I have <lb/>
been recently admitted to the bar, and can only give a <lb/>
faint outline of my future success in that honorable <lb/>
profession; but I trust, sir, like the Eagle, I shall look <lb/>
down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man, and <lb/>
shall ever be ready to give you any assistance in my <lb/>
official capacity, and whatever this muscular arm of <lb/>
mine can do, whenever it shall be called from its buried <lb/>
<i>greatness</i>." The Major grasped him by the hand, and <lb/>
exclaimed: "O thou exalted spirit of inspiration&#x2014; <lb/>
thou flame of burning prosperity, may the Heaven- <lb/>
directed blaze be the glare of thy soul, and battle down <lb/>
every rampart that seems to impede your progress!'</p>
<p>The road which led to the town presented many <lb/>
attractions. Elfonzo had bid farewell to the youth of <lb/>
deep feeling, and was now wending his way to the <lb/>
dreaming spot of his fondness. The south winds <lb/>
whistled through the woods, as the waters dashed <lb/>
against the banks, as rapid fire in the pent furnace <lb/>
roars. This brought him to remember while alone <lb/>
that he quietly left behind the hospitality of a father's <lb/>
house, and gladly entered the world, with higher hopes <lb/>
than are often realized. But as he journeyed onward, <lb/>
he was mindful of the advice of his father, who had <lb/>
often looked sadly on the ground, when tears of cruelly <lb/>
deceived hope moistened his eye. Elfonzo had been <lb/>
somewhat of a dutiful son; yet fond of the amuse- <lb/>
ments of life&#x2014;had been in distant lands&#x2014;had en- <lb/>
joyed the pleasure of the world, and had frequently <lb/>
<pb n="418"/>
returned to the scenes of his boyhood, almost destitute <lb/>
of many of the comforts of life. In this condition, he <lb/>
would frequently say to his father, "Have I offended <lb/>
you, that you look upon me as a stranger, and frown <lb/>
upon me with stinging looks? Will you not favor me <lb/>
with the sound of your voice? If I have trampled <lb/>
upon your veneration, or have spread a humid veil of <lb/>
darkness around your expectations, send me back into <lb/>
the world where no heart beats for me&#x2014;where the <lb/>
foot of man has never yet trod; but give me at least <lb/>
one kind word&#x2014;allow me to come into the presence <lb/>
sometimes of thy winterworn locks." "Forbid it, <lb/>
Heaven, that I should be angry with thee," answered <lb/>
the father, "my son, and yet I send thee back to the <lb/>
children of the world&#x2014;to the cold charity of the <lb/>
combat, and to a land of victory. I read another <lb/>
destiny in thy countenance&#x2014;I learn thy inclinations <lb/>
from the flame that has already kindled in my soul a <lb/>
strange sensation. It will seek thee, my dear <i>Elfonzo</i>, <lb/>
it will find thee&#x2014;thou canst not escape that lighted <lb/>
torch, which shall blot out from the remembrance of <lb/>
men a long train of prophecies which they have foretold <lb/>
against thee. I once thought not so. Once I was <lb/>
blind; but now the path of life is plain before me, and <lb/>
my sight is clear; yet Elfonzo, return to thy worldly <lb/>
occupation&#x2014;take again in thy hand that chord of <lb/>
sweet sounds&#x2014;struggle with the civilized world, and <lb/>
with your own heart; fly swiftly to the enchanted <lb/>
ground&#x2014;let the night-<i>Owl</i> send forth its screams <lb/>
from the stubborn oak&#x2014;let the sea sport upon the <lb/>
beach, and the stars sing together; but learn of these, <lb/>
Elfonzo, thy doom, and thy hiding place. Our most <lb/>
innocent as well as our most lawful <i>desires</i> must often <lb/>
be denied us, that we may learn to sacrifice them to a <lb/>
Higher will."</p>
<p>Remembering such admonitions with gratitude, El- <lb/>
<pb n="419"/>
fonzo was immediately urged by the recollection of his <lb/>
father's family to keep moving. His steps became <lb/>
quicker and quicker&#x2014;he hastened through the <i>piny</i> <lb/>
woods, dark as the forest was, and with joy he very <lb/>
soon reached the little village of repose, in whose <lb/>
bosom rested the boldest chivalry. His close attention <lb/>
to every important object&#x2014;his modest questions about <lb/>
whatever was new to him&#x2014;his reverence for wise old <lb/>
age, and his ardent desire to learn many of the fine <lb/>
arts, soon brought him into respectable notice.</p>
<p>One mild winter day as he walked along the streets <lb/>
towards the Academy, which stood upon a small emi- <lb/>
nence, surrounded by native growth&#x2014;some venerable <lb/>
in its appearance, others young and prosperous&#x2014;all <lb/>
seemed inviting, and seemed to be the very place for <lb/>
learning as well as for genius to spend its research <lb/>
beneath its spreading shades. He entered its classic <lb/>
walls in the usual mode of southern manners. The <lb/>
principal of the Institution begged him to be seated, <lb/>
and listen to the recitations that were going on. He <lb/>
accordingly obeyed the request, and seemed to be <lb/>
much pleased. After the school was dismissed, and <lb/>
the young hearts regained their freedom, with the songs <lb/>
of the evening, laughing at the anticipated pleasures of <lb/>
a happy home, while others tittered at the actions of <lb/>
the past day, he addressed the teacher in a tone that <lb/>
indicated a resolution&#x2014;with an undaunted mind. He <lb/>
said he had determined to become a student, if he could <lb/>
meet with his approbation. "Sir," said he, "I have <lb/>
spent much time in the world. I have traveled among <lb/>
the uncivilized inhabitants of America. I have met <lb/>
with friends, and combated with foes; but none of <lb/>
these gratify my ambition, or decide what is to be my <lb/>
destiny. I see the learned world have an influence with <lb/>
the voice of the people themselves. The despoilers of <lb/>
the remotest kingdoms of the earth, refer their differ- <lb/>
<pb n="420"/>
ences to this class of persons. This the illiterate and <lb/>
inexperienced little dream of; and now if you will re- <lb/>
ceive me as I am, with these deficiencies&#x2014;with all my <lb/>
misguided opinions, I will give you my honor, sir, that <lb/>
I will never disgrace the Institution, or those who have <lb/>
placed you in this honorable station." The instructor, <lb/>
who had met with many disappointments, knew how to <lb/>
feel for a stranger who had been thus turned upon the <lb/>
charities of an unfeeling community. He looked at <lb/>
him earnestly, and said: "Be of good cheer&#x2014;look <lb/>
forward, sir, to the high destination you may attain. <lb/>
Remember, the more elevated the mark at which you <lb/>
aim, the more sure, the more glorious, the more mag- <lb/>
nificent the prize." From wonder to wonder, his <lb/>
encouragement led the impatient listener. A strange <lb/>
nature bloomed before him&#x2014;giant streams promised <lb/>
him success&#x2014;gardens of hidden treasures opened to <lb/>
his view. All this, so vividly described, seemed to <lb/>
gain a new witchery from his glowing fancy.</p>
<p>In 1842 he entered the class, and made rapid prog- <lb/>
ress in the English and Latin departments. Indeed, <lb/>
he continued advancing with such rapidity that he was <lb/>
like to become the first in his class, and made such <lb/>
unexpected progress, and was so studious, that he had <lb/>
almost forgotten the pictured saint of his affections. <lb/>
The fresh wreaths of the pine and cypress, had waited <lb/>
anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heaven upon <lb/>
the heads of those who had so often poured forth <lb/>
the tender emotions of their souls under its boughs. <lb/>
He was aware of the pleasure that he had seen there. <lb/>
So one evening, as he was returning from his reading, <lb/>
he concluded he would pay a visit to this enchanting <lb/>
spot. Little did he think of witnessing a shadow of <lb/>
his former happiness, though, no doubt, he wished it <lb/>
might be so. He continued sauntering by the road- <lb/>
side, meditating on the past. The nearer he approached <lb/>
<pb n="421"/>
the spot, the more anxious he became. At that mo- <lb/>
ment, a tall female figure flitted across his path, with a <lb/>
bunch of roses in her hand; her countenance showed <lb/>
uncommon vivacity, with a resolute spirit; her ivory <lb/>
teeth already appeared as she smiled beautifully, prom- <lb/>
enading&#x2014;while her ringlets of hair dangled uncon- <lb/>
sciously around her snowy neck. Nothing was wanting <lb/>
to complete her beauty. The tinge of the rose was in <lb/>
full bloom upon her cheek; the charms of sensibility <lb/>
and tenderness were always her associates. In Ambu- <lb/>
linia's bosom dwelt a noble soul&#x2014;one that never <lb/>
faded&#x2014;one that never was conquered. Her heart <lb/>
yielded to no feeling, but the love of Elfonzo, on <lb/>
whom she gazed with intense delight, and to whom she <lb/>
felt herself more closely bound, because he sought the <lb/>
hand of no other. Elfonzo was roused from his ap- <lb/>
parent reverie. His books no longer were his insepar- <lb/>
able companions&#x2014;his thoughts arrayed themselves to <lb/>
encourage him to the field of victory. He endeavored <lb/>
to speak to his supposed Ambulinia, but his speech <lb/>
appeared not in words. No, his effort was a stream <lb/>
of fire that kindled his soul into a flame of admiration, <lb/>
and carried his senses away captive. Ambulinia had <lb/>
disappeared to make him more mindful of his duty. <lb/>
As she walked speedily away through the piny woods, <lb/>
she calmly echoed: "Oh, Elfonzo, thou wilt now look <lb/>
from thy sunbeams. Thou shalt now walk in a new <lb/>
path&#x2014;perhaps thy way leads through darkness; but <lb/>
fear not, the stars foretell happiness."</p>
<p>Not many days afterwards, as surrounded by fra- <lb/>
grant flowers, she sat one evening at twilight, to enjoy <lb/>
the cool breeze that whispered notes of melody along <lb/>
the distant groves, the little birds perched on every <lb/>
side, as if to watch the movements of their new visitor. <lb/>
The bells were tolling, when Elfonzo silently stole <lb/>
along by the wild wood flowers, holding in his hand <lb/>
<pb n="422"/>
his favorite instrument of music&#x2014;his eye continually <lb/>
searching for Ambulinia, who hardly seemed to per- <lb/>
ceive him, as she played carelessly with the songsters <lb/>
that hopped from branch to branch. Nothing could <lb/>
be more striking than the difference between the two. <lb/>
Nature seemed to have given the more tender soul to <lb/>
Elfonzo, and the stronger and more courageous to <lb/>
Ambulinia. A deep feeling spoke from the eyes of <lb/>
Elfonzo&#x2014;such a feeling as can only be expressed by <lb/>
those who are blessed as admirers, and by those who <lb/>
are able to return the same with sincerity of heart. He <lb/>
was a few years older than Ambulinia; she had turned a <lb/>
little into her seventeenth. He had almost grown up in <lb/>
the Cherokee country, with the same equal proportions <lb/>
as one of the natives. But little intimacy had existed <lb/>
between them until the year forty-one&#x2014;because the <lb/>
youth felt that the character of such a lovely girl was <lb/>
too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of <lb/>
quiet reverence. But as lovers will not always be in- <lb/>
sulted, at all times and under all circumstances, by the <lb/>
frowns and cold looks of crabbed old age, which <lb/>
should continually reflect dignity upon those around, <lb/>
and treat the unfortunate as well as the fortunate with <lb/>
a graceful mien, he continued to use diligence and <lb/>
perseverance. All this lighted a spark in his heart that <lb/>
changed his whole character, and like the unyielding <lb/>
Deity that follows the storm to check its rage in the <lb/>
forest, he resolves for the first time to shake off his <lb/>
embarrassment, and return where he had before only <lb/>
worshiped.</p>
<p>It could not escape Ambulinia's penetrating eye that <lb/>
he sought an interview with her, which she as anxiously <lb/>
avoided, and assumed a more distant calmness than <lb/>
before, seemingly to destroy all hope. After many <lb/>
efforts and struggles with his own person, with timid <lb/>
steps the Major approached the damsel, with the same <lb/>
<pb n="423"/>
caution as he would have done in a field of battle. <lb/>
"Lady Ambulinia," said he, trembling, "I have long <lb/>
desired a moment like this. I dare not let it escape. <lb/>
I fear the consequences; yet I hope your indulgence <lb/>
will at least hear my petition. Can you not anticipate <lb/>
what I would say, and what I am about to express? <lb/>
Will not you, like Minerva, who sprung from the brain <lb/>
of Jupiter, release me from thy winding chains or cure <lb/>
me&#x2014;" "Say no more, Elfonzo," answered Ambu- <lb/>
linia, with a serious look, raising her hand as if she <lb/>
intended to swear eternal hatred against the whole <lb/>
world; "another lady in my place would have perhaps <lb/>
answered your question in bitter coldness. I know <lb/>
not the little arts of my sex. I care but little for the <lb/>
vanity of those who would chide me, and am unwilling <lb/>
as well as ashamed to be guilty of anything that would <lb/>
lead you to think 'all is not gold that glitters'; so be <lb/>
not rash in your resolution. It is better to repent now <lb/>
than to do it in a more solemn hour. Yes, I know <lb/>
what you would say. I know you have a costly gift <lb/>
for me&#x2014;the noblest that man can make&#x2014;<i>your heart!</i> <lb/>
you should not offer it to one so unworthy. Heaven, <lb/>
you know, has allowed my father's house to be made a <lb/>
house of solitude, a home of silent obedience, which <lb/>
my parents say is more to be admired than big names <lb/>
and high-sounding titles. Notwithstanding all this, let <lb/>
me speak the emotions of an honest heart; allow me <lb/>
to say in the fullness of my hopes that I anticipate <lb/>
better days. The bird may stretch its wings towards <lb/>
the sun, which it can never reach; and flowers of the <lb/>
field appear to ascend in the same direction, because <lb/>
they cannot do otherwise; but man confides his com- <lb/>
plaints to the saints in whom he believes; for in their <lb/>
abodes of light they know no more sorrow. From <lb/>
your confession and indicative looks, I must be that <lb/>
person; if so, deceive not yourself."</p>
<pb n="424"/>
<p>Elfonzo replied, "Pardon me, my dear madam, for <lb/>
my frankness. I have loved you from my earliest <lb/>
days; everything grand and beautiful hath borne the <lb/>
image of Ambulinia; while precipices on every hand <lb/>
surrounded me, your <i>guardian angel</i> stood and beck- <lb/>
oned me away from the deep abyss. In every trial, in <lb/>
every misfortune, I have met with your helping hand; <lb/>
yet I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love till a <lb/>
voice impaired with age encouraged the cause, and <lb/>
declared they who acquired thy favor should win a <lb/>
victory. I saw how Leos worshiped thee. I felt my <lb/>
own unworthiness. I began to <i>know jealousy</i>&#x2014;a <lb/>
strong guest, indeed, in my bosom&#x2014;yet I could see <lb/>
if I gained your admiration Leos was to be my rival. I <lb/>
was aware that he had the influence of your parents, <lb/>
and the wealth of a deceased relative, which is too <lb/>
often mistaken for permanent and regular tranquility; <lb/>
yet I have determined by your permission to beg an <lb/>
interest in your prayers&#x2014;to ask you to animate my <lb/>
drooping spirits by your smiles and your winning <lb/>
looks; for if you but speak I shall be conqueror, <lb/>
my enemies shall stagger like Olympus shakes. And <lb/>
though earth and sea may tremble, and the charioteer <lb/>
of the sun may forget his dashing steed, yet I am <lb/>
assured that it is only to arm me with divine weapons <lb/>
which will enable me to complete my long-tried inten- <lb/>
tion." "Return to yourself, Elfonzo," said Ambu- <lb/>
linia, pleasantly; "a dream of vision has disturbed <lb/>
your intellect; you are above the atmosphere, dwelling <lb/>
in the celestial regions; nothing is there that urges or <lb/>
hinders, nothing that brings discord into our present <lb/>
litigation. I entreat you to condescend a little, and be <lb/>
a man, and forget it all. When Homer describes the <lb/>
battle of the gods and noble men fighting with giants <lb/>
and dragons, they represent under this image our <lb/>
struggles with the delusions of our passions. You <lb/>
<pb n="425"/>
have exalted me, an unhappy girl, to the skies; you <lb/>
have called me a saint, and portrayed in your imagina- <lb/>
tion an angel in human form. Let her remain such to <lb/>
you, let her continue to be as you have supposed, and <lb/>
be assured that she will consider a share in your esteem <lb/>
as her highest treasure. Think not that I would allure <lb/>
you from the path in which your conscience leads you; <lb/>
for you know I respect the conscience of others, as I <lb/>
would die for my own. Elfonzo, if I am worthy of <lb/>
thy love, let such conversation never again pass be- <lb/>
tween us. Go, seek a nobler theme! we will seek it in <lb/>
the stream of time, as the sun set in the Tigris." As <lb/>
she spake these words she grasped the hand of Elfonzo, <lb/>
saying at the same time, "Peace and prosperity attend <lb/>
you, my hero; be up and doing!" Closing her re- <lb/>
marks with this expression, she walked slowly away, <lb/>
leaving Elfonzo astonished and amazed. He ventured <lb/>
not to follow or detain her. Here he stood alone, <lb/>
gazing at the stars; confounded as he was, here he <lb/>
stood. The rippling stream rolled on at his feet. <lb/>
Twilight had already begun to draw her sable mantle <lb/>
over the earth, and now and then the fiery smoke <lb/>
would ascend from the little town which lay spread out <lb/>
before him. The citizens seemed to be full of life and <lb/>
good-humor; but poor Elfonzo saw not a brilliant <lb/>
scene. No; his future life stood before him, stripped <lb/>
of the hopes that once adorned all his sanguine desires. <lb/>
"Alas!" said he, "am I now Grief's disappointed <lb/>
son at last." Ambulinia's image rose before his fancy. <lb/>
A mixture of ambition and greatness of soul moved <lb/>
upon his young heart, and encouraged him to bear all <lb/>
his crosses with the patience of a Job, notwithstanding <lb/>
he had to encounter with so many obstacles. He still <lb/>
endeavored to prosecute his studies, and reasonably <lb/>
progressed in his education. Still, he was not content; <lb/>
there was something yet to be done before his happi- <lb/>
<pb n="426"/>
ness was complete. He would visit his friends and ac- <lb/>
quaintances. They would invite him to social parties, <lb/>
insisting that he should partake of the amusements that <lb/>
were going on. This he enjoyed tolerably well. The <lb/>
ladies and gentlemen were generallly well pleased with <lb/>
the Major; as he delighted all with his violin, which <lb/>
seemed to have a thousand chords&#x2014;more symphoni- <lb/>
ous than the Muses of Apollo, and more enchanting <lb/>
than the ghost of the Hills. He passed some days in <lb/>
the country. During that time Leos had made many <lb/>
calls upon Ambulinia, who was generally received with <lb/>
a great deal of courtesy by the family. They thought <lb/>
him to be a young man worthy of attention, though he <lb/>
had but little in his soul to attract the attention or <lb/>
even win the affections of her whose graceful manners <lb/>
had almost made him a slave to every bewitching look <lb/>
that fell from her eyes. Leos made several attempts <lb/>
to tell her of his fair prospects&#x2014;how much he loved <lb/>
her, and how much it would add to his bliss if he could <lb/>
but think she would be willing to share these blessings <lb/>
with him; but, choked by his undertaking, he made <lb/>
himself more like an inactive drone, than he did like <lb/>
one who bowed at beauty's shrine.</p>
<p>Elfonzo again wends his way to the stately walls and <lb/>
new-built village. He now determines to see the end <lb/>
of the prophecy which had been foretold to him. The <lb/>
clouds burst from his sight; he believes if he can but <lb/>
see his Ambulinia, he can open to her view the bloody <lb/>
altars that have been misrepresented to stigmatize his <lb/>
name. He knows that her breast is transfixed with the <lb/>
sword of reason, and ready at all times to detect the <lb/>
hidden villainy of her enemies. He resolves to see her <lb/>
in her own home, with the consoling theme: "'I can <lb/>
but perish if I go.' Let the consequences be what <lb/>
they may," said he, "if I die, it shall be contending <lb/>
and struggling for my own rights."</p>
<pb n="427"/>
<p>Night had almost overtaken him when he arrived in <lb/>
town. Colonel Elder, a noble-hearted, high-minded, <lb/>
and independent man, met him at his door as usual, <lb/>
and seized him by the hand. "Well, Elfonzo," said <lb/>
the Colonel, "how does the world use you in your <lb/>
efforts?" "I have no objection to the world," said <lb/>
Elfonzo, "but the people are rather singular in some <lb/>
of their opinions." "Aye, well," said the Colonel, <lb/>
"you must remember that creation is made up of <lb/>
many mysteries; just take things by the right handle; <lb/>
be always sure you know which is the smooth side <lb/>
before you attempt your polish; be reconciled to your <lb/>
fate, be it what it may; and never find fault with your <lb/>
condition, unless your complaining will benefit it. <lb/>
Perseverance is a principle that should be commend- <lb/>
able in those who have judgment to govern it. I <lb/>
should never have been so successful in my hunting <lb/>
excursions had I waited till the deer, by some magic <lb/>
dream, had been drawn to the muzzle of the gun before <lb/>
I made an attempt to fire at the game that dared my <lb/>
boldness in the wild forest. The great mystery in <lb/>
hunting seems to be&#x2014;a good marksman, a resolute <lb/>
mind, a fixed determination, and my word for it, you <lb/>
will never return home without sounding your horn <lb/>
with the breath of a new victory. And so with every <lb/>
other undertaking. Be confident that your ammunition <lb/>
is of the right kind&#x2014;always pull your trigger with a <lb/>
steady hand, and so soon as you perceive a calm, touch <lb/>
her off, and the spoils are yours."</p>
<p>This filled him with redoubled vigor, and he set out <lb/>
with a stronger anxiety than ever to the home of <lb/>
Ambulinia. A few short steps soon brought him to <lb/>
the door, half out of breath. He rapped gently. <lb/>
Ambulinia, who sat in the parlor alone, suspecting <lb/>
Elfonzo was near, ventured to the door, opened it, and <lb/>
beheld the hero, who stood in an humble attitude, <lb/>
<pb n="428"/>
bowed gracefully, and as they caught each other's <lb/>
looks, the light of peace beamed from the eyes of <lb/>
Ambulinia. Elfonzo caught the expression; a halloo <lb/>
of smothered shouts ran through every vein, and for <lb/>
the first time he dared to impress a kiss upon her <lb/>
cheek. The scene was overwhelming; had the tempta- <lb/>
tion been less animating, he would not have ventured <lb/>
to have acted so contrary to the desired wish of his <lb/>
Ambulinia; but who could have withstood the irresisti- <lb/>
ble temptation! What society condemns the practice, <lb/>
but a cold, heartless, uncivilized people, that know <lb/>
nothing of the warm attachments of refined society? <lb/>
Here the dead was raised to his long cherished hopes, <lb/>
and the lost was found. Here all doubt and danger <lb/>
were buried in the vortex of oblivion; sectional differ- <lb/>
ences no longer disunited their opinions; like the freed <lb/>
bird from the cage, sportive claps its rustling wings, <lb/>
wheels about to heaven in a joyful strain, and raises its <lb/>
notes to the upper sky. Ambulinia insisted upon El- <lb/>
fonzo to be seated, and give her a history of his <lb/>
unnecessary absence; assuring him the family had re- <lb/>
tired, consequently they would ever remain ignorant of <lb/>
his visit. Advancing towards him, she gave a bright <lb/>
display of her rosy neck, and from her head the am- <lb/>
brosial locks breathed divine fragrance; her robe hung <lb/>
waving to his view, while she stood like a goddess <lb/>
confessed before him.</p>
<p>"It does seem to me, my dear sir," said Ambulinia, <lb/>
"that you have been gone an age. Oh, the restless <lb/>
hours I have spent since I last saw you, in yon beauti- <lb/>
ful grove. There is where I trifled with your feelings <lb/>
for the express purpose of trying your attachment for <lb/>
me. I now find you are devoted; but ah! I trust you <lb/>
live not unguarded by the powers of Heaven. Though <lb/>
oft did I refuse to join my hand with thine, and as oft <lb/>
did I cruelly mock thy entreaties with borrowed <lb/>
<pb n="429"/>
shapes: yes, I feared to answer thee by terms, in <lb/>
words sincere and undissembled. Oh, could I pursue, <lb/>
and you had leisure to hear the annals of my woes, the <lb/>
evening star would shut Heaven's gates upon the im- <lb/>
pending day before my tale would be finished, and <lb/>
this night would find me soliciting your forgiveness." <lb/>
"Dismiss thy fears and thy doubts," replied Elfonzo. <lb/>
"Look, oh, look: that angelic look of thine&#x2014;bathe <lb/>
not thy visage in tears; banish those floods that are <lb/>
gathering; let my confession and my presence bring <lb/>
thee some relief." "Then, indeed, I will be cheer- <lb/>
ful," said Ambulinia, "and I think if we will go to <lb/>
the exhibition this evening, we certainly will see some- <lb/>
thing worthy of our attention. One of the most tragical <lb/>
scenes is to be acted that has ever been witnessed, and <lb/>
one that every jealous-hearted person should learn a <lb/>
lesson from. It cannot fail to have a good effect, as it <lb/>
will be performed by those who are young and vigor- <lb/>
ous, and learned as well as enticing. You are aware, <lb/>
Major Elfonzo, who are to appear on the stage, and <lb/>
what the characters are to represent." "I am ac- <lb/>
quainted with the circumstances," replied Elfonzo, <lb/>
"and as I am to be one of the musicians upon that <lb/>
interesting occasion, I should be much gratified if you <lb/>
would favor me with your company during the hours of <lb/>
the exercises."</p>
<p>"What strange notions are in your mind?" inquired <lb/>
Ambulinia. "Now I know you have something in <lb/>
view, and I desire you to tell me why it is that you are <lb/>
so anxious that I should continue with you while the <lb/>
exercises are going on; though if you think I can add <lb/>
to your happiness and predilections, I have no particu- <lb/>
lar objection to acquiesce in your request. Oh, I <lb/>
think I foresee now what you anticipate." "And <lb/>
will you have the goodness to tell me what you think <lb/>
it to be?" inquired Elfonzo. "By all means," an- <lb/>
<pb n="430"/>
swered Ambulinia; "a rival, sir, you would fancy in <lb/>
your own mind; but let me say to you, fear not! fear <lb/>
not! I will be one of the last persons to disgrace my <lb/>
sex, by thus encouraging every one who may feel dis- <lb/>
posed to visit me, who may honor me with their grace- <lb/>
ful bows and their choicest compliments. It is true, <lb/>
that young men too often mistake civil politeness for <lb/>
the finer emotions of the heart, which is tantamount to <lb/>
courtship; but, ah! how often are they deceived when <lb/>
they come to test the weight of sunbeams, with those <lb/>
on whose strength hangs the future happiness of an <lb/>
untried life."</p>
<p>The people were now rushing to the Academy with <lb/>
impatient anxiety; the band of music was closely fol- <lb/>
lowed by the students; then the parents and guardians; <lb/>
nothing interrupted the glow of spirits which ran <lb/>
through every bosom, tinged with the songs of a Virgil <lb/>
and the tide of a Homer. Elfonzo and Ambulinia <lb/>
soon repaired to the scene, and fortunately for them <lb/>
both the house was so crowded that they took their <lb/>
seats together in the music department, which was not <lb/>
in view of the auditory. This fortuitous circumstance <lb/>
added more to the bliss of the Major than a thousand <lb/>
such exhibitions would have done. He forgot that he <lb/>
was man; music had lost its charms for him; when- <lb/>
ever he attempted to carry his part, the string of the <lb/>
instrument would break, the bow became stubborn, <lb/>
and refused to obey the loud calls of the audience. <lb/>
Here, he said, was the paradise of his home, the long- <lb/>
sought-for opportunity; he felt as though he could <lb/>
send a million supplications to the throne of Heaven, <lb/>
for such an exalted privilege. Poor Leos, who was <lb/>
somewhere in the crowd, looking as attentively as if he <lb/>
was searching for a needle in a haystack; here he <lb/>
stood, wondering to himself why Ambulinia was not <lb/>
there. "Where can she be? Oh! if she was only <lb/>
<pb n="431"/>
here, how I could relish the scene! Elfonzo is cer- <lb/>
tainly not in town; but what if he is? I have got the <lb/>
wealth, if I have not the dignity, and I am sure that <lb/>
the squire and his lady have always been particular <lb/>
friends of mine, and I think with this assurance I shall <lb/>
be able to get upon the blind side of the rest of the <lb/>
family, and make the heaven-born Ambulinia the mis- <lb/>
tress of all I possess." Then, again, he would drop <lb/>
his head, as if attempting to solve the most difficult <lb/>
problem in Euclid. While he was thus conjecturing in <lb/>
his own mind, a very interesting part of the exhibition <lb/>
was going on, which called the attention of all present. <lb/>
The curtains of the stage waved continually by the <lb/>
repelled forces that were given to them, which caused <lb/>
Leos to behold Ambulinia leaning upon the chair of <lb/>
Elfonzo. Her lofty beauty, seen by the glimmering <lb/>
of the chandelier, filled his heart with rapture, he knew <lb/>
not how to contain himself; to go where they were, <lb/>
would expose him to ridicule; to continue where he <lb/>
was, with such an object before him, without being <lb/>
allowed an explanation in that trying hour, would be to <lb/>
the great injury of his mental as well as of his physical <lb/>
powers; and, in the name of high heaven, what must <lb/>
he do? Finally, he resolved to contain himself as well <lb/>
as he conveniently could, until the scene was over, and <lb/>
then he would plant himself at the door, to arrest <lb/>
Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo, and <lb/>
thus make for himself a more prosperous field of im- <lb/>
mortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence, or <lb/>
ever pencil drew or artist imagined. Accordingly he <lb/>
made himself sentinel immediately after the perform- <lb/>
ance of the evening&#x2014;retained his position apparently <lb/>
in defiance of all the world, he waited, he gazed at <lb/>
every lady, his whole frame trembled; here he stood, <lb/>
until everything like human shape had disappeared <lb/>
from the institution, and he had done nothing; he had <lb/>
<pb n="432"/>
failed to accomplish that which he so eagerly sought <lb/>
for. Poor, unfortunate creature! he had not the eyes <lb/>
of an Argus, or he might have seen his Juno and El- <lb/>
fonzo, assisted by his friend Sigma, make their escape <lb/>
from the window, and, with the rapidity of a race- <lb/>
horse, hurry through the blast of the storm, to the <lb/>
residence of her father, without being recognized. He <lb/>
did not tarry long, but assured Ambulinia the endless <lb/>
chain of their existence was more closely connected <lb/>
than ever, since he had seen the virtuous, innocent, <lb/>
imploring, and the constant Amelia murdered by the <lb/>
jealous-hearted Farcillo, the accursed of the land.</p>
<p>The following is the tragical scene, which is only <lb/>
introduced to show the subject matter that enabled <lb/>
Elfonzo to come to such a determinate resolution, that <lb/>
nothing of the kind should ever dispossess him of his <lb/>
true character, should he be so fortunate as to succeed <lb/>
in his present undertaking.</p>
<p>Amelia was the wife of Farcillo, and a virtuous <lb/>
woman; Gracia, a young lady, was her particular <lb/>
friend and confidant. Farcillo grew jealous of Amelia, <lb/>
murders her, finds out that he was deceived, <i>and stabs <lb/>
himself</i>. Amelia appears alone, talking to herself.</p>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i>.</speaker><p>Hail, ye solitary ruins of antiquity, ye sacred <lb/>
tombs and silent walks! it is your aid I invoke; it is <lb/>
to you, my soul, wrapt in deep meditation, pours forth <lb/>
its prayer. Here I wander upon the stage of mortality, <lb/>
since the world hath turned against me. Those whom <lb/>
I believed to be my friends, alas! are now my enemies, <lb/>
planting thorns in all my paths, poisoning all my <lb/>
pleasures, and turning the past to pain. What a <lb/>
lingering catalogue of sighs and tears lies just before <lb/>
me, crowding my aching bosom with the fleeting dream <lb/>
of humanity, which must shortly terminate. And to <lb/>
what purpose will all this bustle of life, these agitations <lb/>
and emotions of the heart have conduced, if it leave <lb/>
<pb n="433"/>
behind it nothing of utility, if it leave no traces of <lb/>
improvement? Can it be that I am deceived in my <lb/>
conclusions? No, I see that I have nothing to hope <lb/>
for, but everything to fear, which tends to drive me <lb/>
from the walks of time.</p></sp>

</lg></q>
<q>(Enter Gracia.)</q>
<sp><speaker><i>G</i>.</speaker><p>Oh, Amelia, is it you, the object of grief, the <lb/>
daughter of opulence, of wisdom and philosophy, that <lb/>
thus complaineth? It cannot be you are the child of <lb/>
misfortune, speaking of the monuments of former ages, <lb/>
which were allotted not for the reflection of the dis- <lb/>
tressed, but for the fearless and bold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i>.</speaker><p>Not the child of poverty, Gracia, or the heir of <lb/>
glory and peace, but of fate. Remember, I have <lb/>
wealth more than wit can number; I have had power <lb/>
more than kings could encompass; yet the world seems <lb/>
a desert; all nature appears an afflictive spectacle of <lb/>
warring passions. This blind fatality, that capriciously <lb/>
sports with the rules and lives of mortals, tells me that <lb/>
the mountains will never again send forth the water of <lb/>
their springs to my thirst. Oh, that I might be freed <lb/>
and set at liberty from wretchedness! But I fear, I <lb/>
fear this will never be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>G</i>.</speaker><p>Why, Amelia, this untimely grief? What has <lb/>
caused the sorrows that bespeak better and happier <lb/>
days, to thus lavish out such heaps of misery? You <lb/>
are aware that your instructive lessons embellish the <lb/>
mind with holy truths, by wedding its attention to none <lb/>
but great and noble affections.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A</i>.</speaker><p>This, of course, is some consolation. I will ever <lb/>
love my own species with feelings of a fond recollec- <lb/>

philanthropy, and the spotless name of my own sex, I <lb/>

I have accelerated the advancement of one who whis- <lb/>

Oh, wretch that I am! Oh, angels forgive me! Oh, <lb/>
God, withhold thy vengeance! Oh, Amelia! if Heaven <lb/>
would make a thousand worlds like this, set with dia- <lb/>

have done this for them all, I would not have frowned <lb/>

<pb n="441"/>
<p>Soon after the excitement of this tragical scene was <lb/>
over, and the enlisted feeling for Amelia had grown <lb/>
more buoyant with Elfonzo and Ambulinia, he deter- <lb/>
mined to visit his retired home, and make the necessary <lb/>
improvements to enjoy a better day; consequently he <lb/>
conveyed the following lines to Ambulinia: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Go tell the world that hope is glowing,</l>
<l rend="indent">Go bid the rocks their silence break,</l>
<l>Go tell the stars that love is glowing,</l>
<l rend="indent">Then bid the hero his lover take.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In the region where scarcely the foot of man hath <lb/>
ever trod, where the woodman hath not found his way, <lb/>
lies a blooming grove, seen only by the sun when he <lb/>
mounts his lofty throne, visited only by the light of <lb/>
the stars, to whom are intrusted the guardianship of <lb/>
earth, before the sun sinks to rest in his rosy bed. <lb/>
High cliffs of rocks surround the romantic place, and <lb/>
in the small cavity of the rocky wall grows the daffodil <lb/>
clear and pure; and as the wind blows along the en- <lb/>
chanting little mountain which surrounds the lonely <lb/>
spot, it nourishes the flowers with the dewdrops of <lb/>
heaven. Here is the seat of Elfonzo; darkness claims <lb/>
but little victory over this dominion, and in vain does <lb/>
she spread out her gloomy wings. Here the waters <lb/>
flow perpetually, and the trees lash their tops together <lb/>
to bid the welcome visitor a happy muse. Elfonzo, <lb/>
during his short stay in the country, had fully per- <lb/>
suaded himself that it was his duty to bring this solemn <lb/>
matter to an issue. A duty that he individually owed, <lb/>
as a gentleman, to the parents of Ambulinia, a duty in <lb/>
itself involving not only his own happiness and his <lb/>
own standing in society, but one that called aloud the <lb/>
act of the parties to make it perfect and complete. <lb/>
How he should communicate his intentions to get a <lb/>
favorable reply, he was at a loss to know; he knew not <lb/>
<pb n="442"/>
whether to address Esq. Valeer in prose or in poetry, <lb/>
in a jocular or an argumentative manner, or whether he <lb/>
should use moral suasion, legal injunction, or seize and <lb/>
take by reprisal; if it was to do the latter, he would <lb/>
have no difficulty in deciding in his own mind, but his <lb/>
gentlemanly honor was at stake; so he concluded to <lb/>
address the following letter to the father and mother of <lb/>
Ambulinia, as his address in person he knew would <lb/>
only aggravate the old gentleman, and perhaps his <lb/>
lady.</p>

<p>Again, I resume the pleasing task of addressing you, and once more <lb/>
beg an immediate answer to my many salutations. From every circumstance <lb/>
that has taken place, I feel in duty bound to comply with my obligations; <lb/>
to forfeit my word would be more than I dare do; to break my pledge, and <lb/>
my vows that have been witnessed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of <lb/>
an unseen Deity, would be disgraceful on my part, as well as ruinous to <lb/>
Ambulinia. I wish no longer to be kept in suspense about this matter. I <lb/>
wish to act gentlemanly in every particular. It is true, the promises I have <lb/>
made are unknown to any but Ambulinia, and I think it unnecessary to here <lb/>
enumerate them, as they who promise the most, generally perform the least. <lb/>
Can you for a moment doubt my sincerity, or my character? My only wish is, <lb/>
sir, that you may calmly and dispassionately look at the situation of the case, <lb/>
and if your better judgment should dictate otherwise, my obligations may <lb/>
induce me to pluck the flower that you so diametrically opposed. We have <lb/>

<p>The moon and stars had grown pale when Ambulinia <lb/>
had retired to rest. A crowd of unpleasant thoughts <lb/>
passed through her bosom. Solitude dwelt in her <lb/>
chamber&#x2014;no sound from the neighboring world pene- <lb/>
<pb n="443"/>
trated its stillness; it appeared a temple of silence, of <lb/>
repose, and of mystery. At that moment she heard a <lb/>
still voice calling her father. In an instant, like the <lb/>
flash of lightning, a thought ran through her mind that <lb/>
it must be the bearer of Elfonzo's communication. <lb/>
"It is not a dream!" she said, "no, I cannot read <lb/>
dreams. Oh! I would to Heaven I was near that <lb/>
glowing eloquence&#x2014;that poetical language&#x2014;it charms <lb/>
the mind in an inexpressible manner, and warms the <lb/>
coldest heart." While consoling herself with this <lb/>
strain, her father rushed into her room almost frantic <lb/>
with rage, exclaiming: "Oh, Ambulinia! Ambulinia!! <lb/>
undutiful, ungrateful daughter! What does this mean? <lb/>
Why does this letter bear such heartrending intelli- <lb/>
gence? Will you quit a father's house with this de- <lb/>
based wretch, without a place to lay his distracted <lb/>
head; going up and down the country, with every <lb/>
novel object that may chance to wander through this <lb/>
region. He is a pretty man to make love known to <lb/>
his superiors, and you, Ambulinia, have done but little <lb/>
credit to yourself by honoring his visits. Oh, wretched- <lb/>
ness! can it be that my hopes of happiness are forever <lb/>
blasted! Will you not listen to a father's entreaties, <lb/>
and pay some regard to a mother's tears. I know, <lb/>
and I do pray that God will give me fortitude to bear <lb/>
with this sea of troubles, and rescue my daughter, my <lb/>
Ambulinia, as a brand from the eternal burning." <lb/>
"Forgive me, father, oh! forgive thy child," replied <lb/>
Ambulinia. "My heart is ready to break, when I see <lb/>
you in this grieved state of agitation. Oh! think not <lb/>
so meanly of me, as that I mourn for my own danger. <lb/>
Father, I am only woman. Mother, I am only the <lb/>
templement of thy youthful years, but will suffer <lb/>
courageously whatever punishment you think proper <lb/>
to inflict upon me, if you will but allow me to comply <lb/>
with my most sacred promises&#x2014;if you will but give <lb/>
<pb n="444"/>
me my personal right, and my personal liberty. Oh, <lb/>
father! if your generosity will but give me these, I <lb/>
ask nothing more. When Elfonzo offered me his <lb/>
heart, I gave him my hand, never to forsake him, and <lb/>
now may the mighty God banish me, before I leave <lb/>
him in adversity. What a heart must I have to rejoice <lb/>
in prosperity with him whose offers I have accepted, <lb/>
and then, when poverty comes, haggard as it may be <lb/>
&#x2014;for me to trifle with the oracles of Heaven, and <lb/>
change with every fluctuation that may interrupt our <lb/>
happiness&#x2014;like the politician who runs the political <lb/>
gauntlet for office one day, and the next day, because <lb/>
the horizon is darkened a little, he is seen running for <lb/>
his life, for fear he might perish in its ruins. Where <lb/>
is the philosophy; where is the consistency; where is <lb/>
the charity; in conduct like this? Be happy then, my <lb/>
beloved father, and forget me; let the sorrow of part- <lb/>
ing break down the wall of separation and make us <lb/>
equal in our feeling; let me now say how ardently I <lb/>
love you; let me kiss that age-worn cheek, and should <lb/>
my tears bedew thy face, I will wipe them away. Oh, <lb/>
I never can forget you; no, never, never!"</p>
<p>"Weep not," said the father. "Ambulinia, I will <lb/>
forbid Elfonzo my house, and desire that you may <lb/>
keep retired a few days. I will let him know that my <lb/>
friendship for my family is not linked together by <lb/>
cankered chains; and if he ever enters upon my prem- <lb/>
ises again, I will send him to his long home." "Oh, <lb/>
father! let me entreat you to be calm upon this occa- <lb/>
sion, and though Elfonzo may be the sport of the <lb/>
clouds and winds, yet I feel assured that no fate will <lb/>
send him to the silent tomb, until the God of the <lb/>
Universe calls him hence with a triumphant voice."</p>
<p>Here the father turned away, exclaiming: "I will <lb/>
answer his letter in a very few words, and you, madam, <lb/>
will have the goodness to stay at home with your <lb/>
<pb n="445"/>
mother; and, remember, I am determined to protect <lb/>
you from the consuming fire that looks so fair to your <lb/>
view."</p>

<p>When Elfonzo read the above letter, he became so <lb/>
much depressed in spirits that many of his friends <lb/>
thought it advisable to use other means to bring about <lb/>
the happy union. "Strange," said he, "that the <lb/>
contents of this diminutive letter should cause me to <lb/>
have such depressed feelings; but there is a nobler <lb/>
theme that this. I know not why my <i>military title</i> is <lb/>
not as great as that of <foreign lang="fre"><i>Squire Valeer</i></foreign>. For my life I <lb/>
cannot see that my ancestors are inferior to those who <lb/>
are so bitterly opposed to my marriage with Ambulinia. <lb/>
I know I have seen huge mountains before me, yet, <lb/>
when I think that I know gentlemen will insult me <lb/>
upon this delicate matter, should I become angry at <lb/>
fools and babblers, who pride themselves in their im- <lb/>
pudence and ignorance. No. My equals! I know not <lb/>
where to find them. My inferiors! I think it beneath <lb/>
me; and my superiors! I think it presumption; there- <lb/>
fore, if this youthful heart is protected by any of the <lb/>
divine rights, I never will betray my trust."</p>
<p>He was aware that Ambulinia had a confidence that <lb/>
was, indeed, as firm and as resolute as she was beauti- <lb/>
ful and interesting. He hastened to the cottage of <lb/>
Louisa, who received him in her usual mode of pleas- <lb/>
antness, and informed him that Ambulinia had just that <lb/>
moment left. "Is it possible?" said Elfonzo. "Oh, <lb/>
murdered hour! Why did she not remain and be the <lb/>
guardian of my secrets? But hasten and tell me how <lb/>
<pb n="446"/>
she has stood this trying scene, and what are her future <lb/>
determinations." "You know," said Louisa, "Major <lb/>
Elfonzo, that you have Ambulinia's first love, which is <lb/>
of no small consequence. She came here about twi- <lb/>
light, and shed many precious tears in consequence of <lb/>
her own fate with yours. We walked silently in yon <lb/>
little valley you see, where we spent a momentary <lb/>
repose. She seemed to be quite as determined as <lb/>
ever, and before we left that beautiful spot she offered <lb/>
up a prayer to Heaven for thee." "I will see her <lb/>
then," replied Elfonzo, "though legions of enemies <lb/>
may oppose. She is mine by foreordination&#x2014;she is <lb/>
mine by prophecy&#x2014;she is mine by her own free will, <lb/>
and I will rescue her from the hands of her oppressors. <lb/>
Will you not, Miss Louisa, assist me in my capture?" <lb/>
"I will certainly, by the aid of Divine Providence," <lb/>
answered Louisa, "endeavor to break those slavish <lb/>
chains that bind the richest of prizes; though allow <lb/>
me, Major, to entreat you to use no harsh means on <lb/>
this important occasion; take a decided stand, and <lb/>
write freely to Ambulinia upon this subject, and I will <lb/>
see that no intervening cause hinders its passage to <lb/>
her. God alone will save a mourning people. Now is <lb/>
the day, and now is the hour to obey a command of <lb/>
such valuable worth." The Major felt himself grow <lb/>
stronger after this short interview with Louisa. He <lb/>
felt as if he could whip his weight in wildcats&#x2014;he <lb/>
knew he was master of his own feelings, and could now <lb/>
write a letter that would bring this litigation to <i>an issue</i>.</p>

<p>We have now reached the most trying moment of our lives; we are <lb/>
pledged not to forsake our trust; we have waited for a favorable hour to <lb/>
come, thinking your friends would settle the matter agreeably among them- <lb/>
selves, and finally be reconciled to our marriage; but as I have waited in <lb/>
vain, and looked in vain, I have determined in my own mind to make a <lb/>
<pb n="447"/>
proposition to you, though you may think it not in accord with your station, <lb/>
or compatible with your rank; yet, "sub hoc signo vinces." You know I <lb/>
cannot resume my visits, in consequence of the utter hostility that your <lb/>
father has to me; therefore the consummation of our union will have to be <lb/>
sought for in a more sublime sphere, at the residence of a respectable friend <lb/>
of this village. You cannot have any scruples upon this mode of proceed- <lb/>
ing, if you will but remember it emanates from one who loves you <lb/>
better than his own life&#x2014;who is more than anxious to bid you welcome to <lb/>
a new and happy home. Your warmest associates say come; the talented, <lb/>
the learned, the wise, and the experienced say come;&#x2014;all these with their <lb/>
friends say, come. Viewing these, with many other inducements, I flatter <lb/>
myself that you will come to the embraces of your Elfonzo; for now is the <lb/>
time of your acceptance and the day of your liberation. You cannot be <lb/>
ignorant, Ambulinia, that thou art the desire of my heart; its thoughts are <lb/>
too noble, and too pure, to conceal themselves from you. I shall wait for <lb/>
your answer to this impatiently, expecting that you will set the time to make <lb/>
your departure, and to be in readiness at a moment's warning to share the <lb/>
joys of a more preferable life. This will be handed to you by Louisa, who <lb/>

<p>Louisa made it convenient to visit Mr. Valeer's, <lb/>
though they did not suspect her in the least the bearer <lb/>
of love epistles; consequently, she was invited in the <lb/>
room to console Ambulinia, where they were left alone. <lb/>
Ambulinia was seated by a small table&#x2014;her head <lb/>
resting on her hand&#x2014;her brilliant eyes were bathed in <lb/>
tears. Louisa handed her the letter of Elfonzo, when <lb/>
another spirit animated her features&#x2014;the spirit of <lb/>
renewed confidence that never fails to strengthen the <lb/>
female character in an hour of grief and sorrow like <lb/>
this, and as she pronounced the last accent of his <lb/>
name, she exclaimed, "And does he love me yet! I <lb/>
never will forget your generosity, Louisa. Oh, un- <lb/>
happy and yet blessed Louisa! may you never feel <lb/>

love. Had I never loved, I never would have been <lb/>
unhappy; but I turn to Him who can save, and if His <lb/>
wisdom does not will my expected union, I know He <lb/>
will give me strength to bear my lot. Amuse yourself <lb/>
with this little book, and take it as an apology for my <lb/>
silence," said Ambulinia, "while I attempt to answer <lb/>
this volume of consolation." "Thank you," said <lb/>
Louisa, "you are excusable upon this occasion; but <lb/>
I pray you, Ambulinia, to be expert upon this mo- <lb/>
mentous subject, that there may be nothing mistrustful <lb/>
upon my part." "I will," said Ambulinia, and im- <lb/>

<p>"I now take my leave of you, sweet girl," said <lb/>
Louisa, "sincerely wishing you success on Sabbath <lb/>
next." When Ambulinia's letter was handed to El- <lb/>
fonzo, he perused it without doubting its contents. <lb/>
Louisa charged him to make but few confidants; but <lb/>
like most young men who happened to win the heart <lb/>
of a beautiful girl, he was so elated with the idea that <lb/>
he felt as a commanding general on parade, who had <lb/>
confidence in all, consequently gave orders to all. The <lb/>
appointed Sabbath, with a delicious breeze and cloud- <lb/>
less sky, made its appearance. The people gathered <lb/>
in crowds to the church&#x2014;the streets were filled with <lb/>
the neighboring citizens, all marching to the house of <lb/>
worship. It is entirely useless for me to attempt to <lb/>
describe the feelings of Elfonzo and Ambulinia, who <lb/>
were silently watching the movements of the multitude, <lb/>
apparently counting them as they entered the house of <lb/>
God, looking for the last one to darken the door. The <lb/>
impatience and anxiety with which they waited, and <lb/>
the bliss they anticipated on the eventful day, is alto- <lb/>
gether indescribable. Those that have been so fortu- <lb/>
nate as to embark in such a noble enterprise, know all <lb/>
its realities; and those who have not had this inestima- <lb/>
ble privilege, will have to taste its sweets before they <lb/>
can tell to others its joys, its comforts, and its Heaven- <lb/>
born worth. Immediately after Ambulinia had assisted <lb/>
the family off to church, she took the advantage of that <lb/>
opportunity to make good her promises. She left a <lb/>
home of enjoyment to be wedded to one whose love <lb/>
had been justifiable. A few short steps brought her to <lb/>
the presence of Louisa, who urged her to make good <lb/>
use of her time, and not to delay a moment, but to go <lb/>
<pb n="450"/>
with her to her brother's house, where Elfonzo would <lb/>
forever make her happy. With lively speed, and yet <lb/>
a graceful air, she entered the door and found herself <lb/>
protected by the champion of her confidence. The <lb/>
necessary arrangements were fast making to have the <lb/>
two lovers united&#x2014;everything was in readiness except <lb/>
the parson; and as they are generally very sanctimoni- <lb/>
ous on such occasions, the news got to the parents of <lb/>
Ambulinia before the everlasting knot was tied, and <lb/>
they both came running, with uplifted hands and in- <lb/>
jured feelings, to arrest their daughter from an un- <lb/>
guarded and hasty resolution. Elfonzo desired to <lb/>
maintain his ground, but Ambulinia thought it best <lb/>
for him to leave, to prepare for a greater contest. He <lb/>
accordingly obeyed, as it would have been a vain en- <lb/>
deavor for him to have battled against a man who was <lb/>
armed with deadly weapons; and besides, he could not <lb/>
resist the request of such a pure heart. Ambulinia <lb/>
concealed herself in the upper story of the house, fear- <lb/>
ing the rebuke of her father; the door was locked, and <lb/>
no chastisement was now expected. Esquire Valeer, <lb/>
whose pride was already touched, resolved to preserve <lb/>
the dignity of his family. He entered the house almost <lb/>
exhausted, looking wildly for Ambulinia. "Amazed <lb/>
and astonished indeed I am," said he, "at a people <lb/>
who call themselves civilized, to allow such behavior as <lb/>
this. Ambulinia, Ambulinia!" he cried, "come to <lb/>
the calls of your first, your best, and your only friend. <lb/>
I appeal to you, sir," turning to the gentleman of the <lb/>
house, "to know where Ambulinia has gone, or where <lb/>
is she?" "Do you mean to insult me, sir, in my <lb/>
own house?" inquired the confounded gentleman. "I <lb/>
will burst," said Mr. V., "asunder every door in your <lb/>
dwelling, in search of my daughter, if you do not <lb/>
speak quickly, and tell me where she is. I care noth- <lb/>
ing about that outcast rubbish of creation, that mean, <lb/>
<pb n="451"/>
low-lived Elfonzo, if I can but obtain Ambulinia. Are <lb/>
you not going to open this door?" said he. "By the <lb/>
Eternal that made Heaven and earth! I will go about <lb/>
the work instantly, if it is not done." The confused <lb/>
citizens gathered from all parts of the village, to know <lb/>
the cause of this commotion. Some rushed into the <lb/>
house; the door that was locked flew open, and there <lb/>
stood Ambulinia, weeping. "Father, be still," said <lb/>
she, "and I will follow thee home." But the agitated <lb/>
man seized her, and bore her off through the gazing <lb/>
multitude. "Father!" she exclaimed, "I humbly beg <lb/>
your pardon&#x2014;I will be dutiful&#x2014;I will obey thy com- <lb/>
mands. Let the sixteen years I have lived in obedience <lb/>
to thee, be my future security." "I don't like to be <lb/>
always giving credit, when the old score is not paid up, <lb/>
madam;" said the father. The mother followed almost <lb/>
in a state of derangement, crying and imploring her to <lb/>
think beforehand, and ask advice from experienced <lb/>
persons, and they would tell her it was a rash under- <lb/>
taking. "Oh!" said she, "Ambulinia, my daughter, <lb/>
did you know what I have suffered&#x2014;did you know <lb/>
how many nights I have whiled away in agony, in pain, <lb/>
and in fear, you would pity the sorrows of a heart- <lb/>
broken mother."</p>
<p>"Well, mother," replied Ambulinia, "I know I <lb/>
have been disobedient; I am aware that what I have <lb/>
done might have been done much better; but oh! <lb/>
what shall I do with my honor? it is so dear to me; I <lb/>
am pledged to Elfonzo. His high moral worth is cer- <lb/>
tainly worth some attention; moreover, my vows, I <lb/>
have no doubt, are recorded in the book of life, and <lb/>
must I give these all up? must my fair hopes be for- <lb/>
ever blasted? Forbid it father, oh! forbid it mother, <lb/>
forbid it heaven." "I have seen so many beautiful <lb/>
skies overclouded," replied the mother, "so many <lb/>
blossoms nipped by the frost, that I am afraid to trust <lb/>
<pb n="452"/>
you to the care of those fair days, which may be inter- <lb/>
rupted by thundering and tempestuous nights. You, <lb/>
no doubt, think as I did&#x2014;life's devious ways were <lb/>
strewed with sweet scented flowers, but ah! how long <lb/>
they have lingered around me and took their flight in <lb/>
the vivid hope that laughs at the drooping victims it <lb/>
has murdered." Elfonzo was moved at this sight. <lb/>
The people followed on to see what was going to <lb/>
become of Ambulinia, while he, with downcast looks, <lb/>
kept at a distance, until he saw them enter the abode <lb/>
of the father, thrusting her, that was the sigh of his <lb/>
soul, out of his presence into a solitary apartment, <lb/>
when she exclaimed, "Elfonzo! Elfonzo! oh, El- <lb/>
fonzo! where art thou, with all thy heroes? haste, <lb/>
oh! haste, come thou to my relief. Ride on the wings <lb/>
of the wind! Turn thy force loose like a tempest, and <lb/>
roll on thy army like a whirlwind, over this mountain <lb/>
of trouble and confusion. Oh, friends! if any pity <lb/>
me, let your last efforts throng upon the green hills, <lb/>
and come to the relief of Ambulinia, who is guilty of <lb/>
nothing but innocent love." Elfonzo called out with <lb/>
a loud voice, "My God, can I stand this! arouse up, <lb/>
I beseech you, and put an end to this tyranny. Come, <lb/>
my brave boys," said he, "are you ready to go forth <lb/>
to your duty?" They stood around him. "Who," <lb/>
said he, "will call us to arms? Where are my thunder- <lb/>
bolts of war? Speak ye, the first who will meet the <lb/>
foe! Who will go forward with me in this ocean of <lb/>
grievous temptation? If there is one who desires to <lb/>
go, let him come and shake hands upon the altar of <lb/>
devotion, and swear that he will be a hero; yes, a <lb/>
Hector in a cause like this, which calls aloud for a <lb/>
speedy remedy." "Mine be the deed," said a young <lb/>
lawyer, "and mine alone; Venus alone shall quit her <lb/>
station before I will forsake one jot or tittle of my <lb/>
promise to you; what is death to me? what is all this <lb/>
<pb n="453"/>
warlike army, if it is not to win a victory? I love the <lb/>
sleep of the lover and the mighty; nor would I give it <lb/>
over till the blood of my enemies should wreak with <lb/>
that of my own. But God forbid that our fame should <lb/>
soar on the blood of the slumberer." Mr. Valeer <lb/>
stands at his door with the frown of a demon upon his <lb/>
brow, with his dangerous weapon ready to strike the <lb/>
first man who should enter his door. "Who will arise <lb/>
and go forward through blood and carnage to the <lb/>
rescue of my Ambulinia?" said Elfonzo. "All," <lb/>
exclaimed the multitude; and onward they went, with <lb/>
their implements of battle. Others, of a more timid <lb/>
nature, stood among the distant hills to see the result <lb/>
of the contest.</p>
<p>Elfonzo took the lead of his band. Night arose <lb/>
in clouds; darkness concealed the heavens; but the <lb/>
blazing hopes that stimulated them gleamed in every <lb/>
bosom. All approached the anxious spot; they rushed <lb/>
to the front of the house and, with one exclamation, <lb/>
demanded Ambulinia. "Away, begone, and disturb <lb/>
my peace no more," said Mr. Valeer. "You are a <lb/>
set of base, insolent, and infernal rascals. Go, the <lb/>
northern star points your path through the dim twilight <lb/>
of the night; go, and vent your spite upon the lonely <lb/>
hills; pour forth your love, you poor, weak-minded <lb/>
wretch, upon your idleness and upon your guitar, and <lb/>
your fiddle; they are fit subjects for your admiration, <lb/>
for let me assure you, though this sword and iron lever <lb/>
are cankered, yet they frown in sleep, and let one of <lb/>
you dare to enter my house this night and you shall <lb/>
have the contents and the weight of these instru- <lb/>
ments." "Never yet did base dishonor blur my <lb/>
name," said Elfonzo: "mine is a cause of renown; <lb/>
here are my warriors, fear and tremble, for this night, <lb/>
though hell itself should oppose, I will endeavor to <lb/>
avenge her whom thou hast banished in solitude. The <lb/>
<pb n="454"/>
voice of Ambulinia shall be heard from that dark <lb/>
dungeon." At that moment Ambulinia appeared at <lb/>
the window above, and with a tremulous voice said, <lb/>
"live, Elfonzo! oh! live to raise my stone of moss! <lb/>
why should such language enter your heart? why <lb/>
should thy voice rend the air with such agitation? I <lb/>
bid thee live, once more remembering these tears of <lb/>
mine are shed alone for thee, in this dark and gloomy <lb/>
vault, and should I perish under this load of trouble, <lb/>
join the song of thrilling accents with the raven above <lb/>
my grave, and lay this tattered frame beside the banks <lb/>
of the Chattahoochee, or the stream of Sawney's <lb/>
brook; sweet will be the song of death to your Ambu- <lb/>
linia. My ghost shall visit you in the smiles of Para- <lb/>
dise, and tell your high fame to the minds of that <lb/>
region, which is far more preferable than this lonely <lb/>
cell. My heart shall speak for thee till the latest hour; <lb/>
I know faint and broken are the sounds of sorrow, yet <lb/>
our souls, Elfonzo, shall hear the peaceful songs <lb/>
together. One bright name shall be ours on high, if <lb/>
we are not permitted to be united here; bear in mind <lb/>
that I still cherish my old sentiments, and the poet will <lb/>
mingle the names of Elfonzo and Ambulinia in the tide <lb/>
of other days."</p>
<p>"Fly, Elfonzo," said the voices of his united band, <lb/>
"to the wounded heart of your beloved. All enemies <lb/>
shall fall beneath thy sword. Fly through the clefts, <lb/>
and the dim spark shall sleep in death." Elfonzo <lb/>
rushes forward and strikes his shield against the door, <lb/>
which was barricaded, to prevent any intercourse. His <lb/>
brave sons throng around him. The people pour <lb/>
along the streets, both male and female, to prevent or <lb/>
witness the melancholy scene.</p>
<p>"To arms, to arms!" cried Elfonzo, "here is a <lb/>
victory to be won, a prize to be gained that is more to <lb/>
me than the whole world beside." "It cannot be <lb/>
<pb n="455"/>
done to-night," said Mr. Valeer. "I bear the clang <lb/>
of death; my strength and armor shall prevail. My <lb/>
Ambulinia shall rest in this hall until the break of <lb/>
another day, and if we fall, we fall together. If we <lb/>
die, we die clinging to our tattered rights, and our <lb/>
blood alone shall tell the mournful tale of a murdered <lb/>
daughter and a ruined father." Sure enough, he kept <lb/>
watch all night, and was successful in defending his <lb/>
house and family. The bright morning gleamed upon <lb/>
the hills, night vanished away, the Major and his asso- <lb/>
ciates felt somewhat ashamed that they had not been <lb/>
as fortunate as they expected to have been; however, <lb/>
they still leaned upon their arms in dispersed groups; <lb/>
some were walking the streets, others were talking in <lb/>
the Major's behalf. Many of the citizens suspended <lb/>
business, as the town presented nothing but consterna- <lb/>
tion. A novelty that might end in the destruction of <lb/>
some worthy and respectable citizens. Mr. Valeer <lb/>
ventured in the streets, though not without being well <lb/>
armed. Some of his friends congratulated him on the <lb/>
decided stand he had taken, and hoped he would settle <lb/>
the matter amicably with Elfonzo, without any serious <lb/>
injury. "Me," he replied, "what, me, condescend <lb/>
to fellowship with a coward, and a low-live, lazy, <lb/>
undermining villain? no, gentlemen, this cannot be; I <lb/>
had rather be borne off, like the bubble upon the dark <lb/>
blue ocean, with Ambulinia by my side, than to have <lb/>
him in the ascending or descending line of relationship. <lb/>
Gentlemen," continued he, "if Elfonzo is so much of <lb/>
a distinguished character, and is so learned in the fine <lb/>
arts, why do you not patronize such men? why not <lb/>
introduce him into your families, as a gentleman of <lb/>
taste and of unequaled magnanimity? why are you so <lb/>
very anxious that he should become a relative of mine? <lb/>
Oh, gentlemen, I fear you yet are tainted with the <lb/>
curiosity of our first parents, who were beguiled by the <lb/>
<pb n="456"/>
poisonous kiss of an old ugly serpent, and who, for <lb/>
one <i>apple, damned</i> all mankind. I wish to divest my- <lb/>
self, as far as possible, of that untutored custom. I <lb/>
have long since learned that the perfection of wisdom, <lb/>
and the end of true philosophy is to proportion our <lb/>
wants to our possessions, our ambition to our capacities; <lb/>
we will then be a happy and a virtuous people." Am- <lb/>
bulinia was sent off to prepare for a long and tedious <lb/>
journey. Her new acquaintances had been instructed <lb/>
by her father how to treat her, and in what manner, <lb/>
and to keep the anticipated visit entirely secret. El- <lb/>
fonzo was watching the movements of everybody; <lb/>
some friends had told him of the plot that was laid to <lb/>
carry off Ambulinia. At night, he rallied some two or <lb/>
three of his forces, and went silently along to the <lb/>
stately mansion; a faint and glimmering light showed <lb/>
through the windows; lightly he steps to the door, <lb/>
there were many voices rallying fresh in fancy's eye; <lb/>
he tapped the shutter, it was opened instantly and he <lb/>
beheld once more seated beside several ladies, the hope <lb/>
of all his toils; he rushed towards her, she rose from <lb/>
her seat, rejoicing; he made one mighty grasp, when <lb/>
Ambulinia exclaimed, "huzza for Major Elfonzo! I <lb/>
will defend myself and you, too, with this conquering <lb/>
instrument I hold in my hand; huzza, I say, I now in- <lb/>
voke time's broad wing to shed around us some dew- <lb/>
drops of verdant spring."</p>
<p>But the hour had not come for this joyous reunion; <lb/>
her friends struggled with Elfonzo for some time, and <lb/>
finally succeeded in arresting her from his hands. He <lb/>
dared not injure them, because they were matrons whose <lb/>
courage needed no spur; she was snatched from the <lb/>
arms of Elfonzo, with so much eagerness, and yet with <lb/>
such expressive signification that he calmly withdrew <lb/>
from this lovely enterprise, with an ardent hope that he <lb/>
should be lulled to repose by the zephyrs which whis- <lb/>
<pb n="457"/>
pered peace to his soul. Several long days and nights <lb/>
passed unmolested, all seemed to have grounded their <lb/>
arms of rebellion, and no callidity appeared to be going <lb/>
on with any of the parties. Other arrangements were <lb/>
made by Ambulinia; she feigned herself to be entirely <lb/>
the votary of a mother's care, and said, by her graceful <lb/>
smiles, that manhood might claim his stern dominion <lb/>
in some other region, where such boisterous love was <lb/>
not so prevalent. This gave the parents a confidence <lb/>
that yielded some hours of sober joy; they believed <lb/>
that Ambulinia would now cease to love Elfonzo, and <lb/>
that her stolen affections would now expire with her <lb/>
misguided opinions. They therefore declined the idea <lb/>
of sending her to a distant land. But oh! they dreamed <lb/>
not of the rapture that dazzled the fancy of Ambulinia, <lb/>
who would say, when alone, youth should not fly away <lb/>
on his rosy pinions, and leave her to grapple in the <lb/>
conflict with unknown admirers.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>No frowning age shall control</l>
<l>The constant current of my soul,</l>
<l>Nor a tear from pity's eye</l>
<l>Shall check my sympathetic sigh.</l>
</lg></q>
<p>With this resolution fixed in her mind, one dark and <lb/>
dreary night, when the winds whistled and the tempest <lb/>
roared, she received intelligence that Elfonzo was then <lb/>
waiting, and every preparation was then ready, at the <lb/>
residence of Dr. Tully, and for her to make a quick <lb/>
escape while the family were reposing. Accordingly <lb/>
she gathered her books, went to the wardrobe supplied <lb/>
with a variety of ornamental dressing, and ventured <lb/>
alone in the streets to make her way to Elfonzo, who <lb/>
was near at hand, impatiently looking and watching her <lb/>
arrival. "What forms," said she, "are those rising <lb/>
before me? What is that dark spot on the clouds? I <lb/>
do wonder what frightful ghost that is, gleaming on <lb/>
<pb n="458"/>
the red tempest? Oh, be merciful and tell me what <lb/>
region you are from. Oh, tell me, ye strong spirits, <lb/>
or ye dark and fleeting clouds, that I yet have a <lb/>
friend." "A friend," said a low, whispering voice. <lb/>
"I am thy unchanging, thy aged, and thy disappointed <lb/>
mother. Oh, Ambulinia, why hast thou deceived me? <lb/>
Why brandish in that hand of thine a javelin of pointed <lb/>
steel? Why suffer that lip I have kissed a thousand <lb/>
times, to equivocate? My daughter, let these tears <lb/>
sink deep into thy soul, and no longer persist in that <lb/>
which may be your destruction and ruin. Come, my <lb/>
dear child, retract your steps, and bear me company to <lb/>
your welcome home." Without one retorting word, <lb/>
or frown from her brow, she yielded to the entreaties <lb/>
of her mother, and with all the mildness of her former <lb/>
character she went along with the silver lamp of age, <lb/>
to the home of candor and benevolence. Her father <lb/>
received her cold and formal politeness&#x2014;"Where has <lb/>
Ambulinia been, this blustering evening, Mrs. Valeer?" <lb/>
inquired he. "Oh, she and I have been taking a <lb/>
solitary walk," said the mother; "all things, I pre- <lb/>
sume, are now working for the best."</p>
<p>Elfonzo heard this news shortly after it happened. <lb/>
"What," said he, "has heaven and earth turned <lb/>
against me? I have been disappointed times without <lb/>
number. Shall I despair?&#x2014;must I give it over? <lb/>
Heaven's decrees will not fade; I will write again&#x2014;I <lb/>
will try again; and if it traverses a gory field, I pray <lb/>
forgiveness at the altar of justice."</p>

<p>I have only time to say to you, not to despair; thy fame shall not perish; <lb/>

<p>The appointed day ushered in undisturbed by any <lb/>
clouds; nothing disturbed Ambulinia's soft beauty. <lb/>
With serenity and loveliness she obeys the request of <lb/>
Elfonzo. The moment the family seated themselves <lb/>
at the table&#x2014;"Excuse my absence for a short time," <lb/>
said she, "while I attend to the placing of those <lb/>
flowers, which should have been done a week ago." <lb/>
And away she ran to the sacred grove, surrounded with <lb/>
glittering pearls, that indicated her coming. Elfonzo <lb/>
hails her with his silver bow and his golden harp. <lb/>
They meet&#x2014;Ambulinia's countenance brightens&#x2014; <lb/>
Elfonzo leads up his winged steed. "Mount," said <lb/>
he, "ye true-hearted, ye fearless soul&#x2014;the day is <lb/>
ours." She sprang upon the back of the young <lb/>
thunderbolt, a brilliant star sparkles upon her head, <lb/>
with one hand she grasps the reins, and with the other <lb/>
she holds an olive branch. "Lend thy aid, ye strong <lb/>
winds," they exclaimed, "ye moon, ye sun, and all <lb/>
ye fair host of heaven, witness the enemy conquered." <lb/>
"Hold," said Elfonzo, "thy dashing steed." "Ride <lb/>
on," said Ambulinia, "the voice of thunder is behind <lb/>
us." And onward they went, with such rapidity that <lb/>
they very soon arrived at Rural Retreat, where they <lb/>
dismounted, and were united with all the solemnities <lb/>
that usually attend such divine operations. They <lb/>
passed the day in thanksgiving and great rejoicing, <lb/>
and on that evening they visited their uncle, where <lb/>
many of their friends and acquaintances had gathered <lb/>
to congratulate them in the field of untainted bliss. <lb/>
<pb n="460"/>
The kind old gentleman met them in the yard: <lb/>
"Well," said he, "I wish I may die, Elfonzo, if you <lb/>
and Ambulinia haven't tied a knot with your tongue <lb/>
that you can't untie with your teeth. But come in, <lb/>
come in, never mind, all is right&#x2014;the world still <lb/>
moves on, and no one has fallen in this great battle."</p>
<p>Happy now is their lot! Unmoved by misfortune, <lb/>
they live among the fair beauties of the South. Heaven <lb/>
spreads their peace and fame upon the arch of the <lb/>
rainbow, and smiles propitously at their triumph, <lb/>
<i>through the tears of the storm</i>.</p>

<head><b>ABOUT ALL KINDS OF SHIPS</b></head>
<div3 type="section">
<head>THE MODERN STEAMER AND THE OBSOLETE <lb/>
STEAMER</head>
<p><smcap>We</smcap> are victims of one common superstition&#x2014;the <lb/>
superstition that we realize the changes that are <lb/>
daily taking place in the world because we read about <lb/>
them and know what they are. I should not have <lb/>
supposed that the modern ship could be a surprise to <lb/>
me, but it is. It seems to be as much of a surprise to <lb/>
me as it could have been if I had never read anything <lb/>
about it. I walk about this great vessel, the <i>Havel</i>, <lb/>
as she plows her way through the Atlantic, and every <lb/>
detail that comes under my eye brings up the miniature <lb/>
counterpart of it as it existed in the little ships I crossed <lb/>
the ocean in fourteen, seventeen, eighteen, and twenty <lb/>
years ago.</p>
<p>In the <i>Havel</i> one can be in several respects more <lb/>
comfortable than he can be in the best hotels on the <lb/>
continent of Europe. For instance, she has several <lb/>
bathrooms, and they are as convenient and as nicely <lb/>
equipped as the bathrooms in a fine private house in <lb/>
America; whereas in the hotels of the continent one <lb/>
bathroom is considered sufficient, and it is generally <lb/>
shabby and located in some out-of-the-way corner of <lb/>
the house; moreover, you need to give notice so long <lb/>
beforehand that you get over wanting a bath by the <lb/>
time you get it. In the hotels there are a good many <lb/>
<pb n="462"/>
different kinds of noises, and they spoil sleep; in my <lb/>
room in the ship I hear no sounds. In the hotels they <lb/>
usually shut off the electric light at midnight; in the <lb/>
ship one may burn it in one's room all night.</p>
<p>In the steamer <i>Batavia</i>, twenty years ago, one candle, <lb/>
set in the bulkhead between two staterooms, was there <lb/>
to light both rooms, but did not light either of them. <lb/>
It was extinguished at 11 at night, and so were all the <lb/>
saloon lamps except one or two, which were left burn- <lb/>
ing to help the passenger see how to break his neck <lb/>
trying to get around in the dark. The passengers sat <lb/>
at table on long benches made of the hardest kind of <lb/>
wood; in the <i>Havel</i> one sits on a swivel chair with a <lb/>
cushioned back to it. In those old times the dinner <lb/>
bill of fare was always the same: a pint of some <lb/>
simple, homely soup or other, boiled codfish and <lb/>
potatoes, slab of boiled beef, stewed prunes for dessert <lb/>
&#x2014;on Sundays "dog in a blanket," on Thursdays <lb/>
"plum duff." In the modern ship the <i>menu</i> is choice <lb/>
and elaborate, and is changed daily. In the old times <lb/>
dinner was a sad occasion; in our day a concealed <lb/>
orchestra enlivens it with charming music. In the old <lb/>
days the decks were always wet; in our day they are <lb/>
usually dry, for the promenade-deck is roofed over, <lb/>
and a sea seldom comes aboard. In a moderately dis- <lb/>
turbed sea, in the old days, a landsman could hardly <lb/>
keep his legs, but in such a sea in our day the decks <lb/>
are as level as a table. In the old days the inside of a <lb/>
ship was the plainest and barrenest thing, and the most <lb/>
dismal and uncomfortable that ingenuity could devise; <lb/>
the modern ship is a marvel of rich and costly decora- <lb/>
tion and sumptuous appointment, and is equipped with <lb/>
every comfort and convenience that money can buy. <lb/>
The old ships had no place of assembly but the dining- <lb/>
room, the new ones have several spacious and beautiful <lb/>
drawing-rooms. The old ships offered the passenger <lb/>
<pb n="463"/>
no chance to smoke except in the place that was called <lb/>
the "fiddle." It was a repulsive den made of rough <lb/>
boards (full of cracks) and its office was to protect the <lb/>
main hatch. It was grimy and dirty; there were no <lb/>
seats; the only light was a lamp of the rancid-oil-and- <lb/>
rag kind; the place was very cold, and never dry, for <lb/>
the seas broke in through the cracks every little while <lb/>
and drenched the cavern thoroughly. In the modern <lb/>
ship there are three or four large smoking-rooms, and <lb/>
they have card tables and cushioned sofas, and are <lb/>
heated by steam and lighted by electricity. There are <lb/>
few European hotels with such smoking-rooms.</p>
<p>The former ships were built of wood, and had two <lb/>
or three water-tight compartments in the hold with <lb/>
doors in them which were often left open, particularly <lb/>
when the ship was going to hit a rock. The modern <lb/>
leviathan is built of steel, and the water-tight bulkheads <lb/>
have no doors in them; they divide the ship into nine <lb/>
or ten water-tight compartments and endow her with <lb/>
as many lives as a cat. Their complete efficiency was <lb/>
established by the happy results following the memor- <lb/>
able accident to the <i>City of Paris</i> a year or two ago.</p>
<p>One curious thing which is at once noticeable in the <lb/>
great modern ship is the absence of hubbub, clatter, <lb/>
rush of feet, roaring of orders. That is all gone by. <lb/>
The elaborate maneuvers necessary in working the <lb/>
vessel into her dock are conducted without sound; one <lb/>
sees nothing of the processes, hears no commands. A <lb/>
Sabbath stillness and solemnity reign, in place of the <lb/>
turmoil and racket of the earlier days. The modern <lb/>
ship has a spacious bridge fenced chin-high with sail- <lb/>
cloth, and floored with wooden gratings; and this <lb/>
bridge, with its fenced fore-and-aft annexes, could ac- <lb/>
commodate a seated audience of a hundred and fifty <lb/>
men. There are three steering equipments, each com- <lb/>
petent if the others should break. From the bridge <lb/>
<pb n="464"/>
the ship is steered, and also handled. The handling <lb/>
is not done by shout or whistle, but by signaling with <lb/>
patent automatic gongs. There are three tell-tales, <lb/>
with plainly lettered dials&#x2014;for steering, handling the <lb/>
engines, and for communicating orders to the invisible <lb/>
mates who are conducting the landing of the ship or <lb/>
casting off. The officer who is astern is out of sight <lb/>
and too far away to hear trumpet calls; but the gongs <lb/>
near him tell him to haul in, pay out, make fast, let <lb/>
go, and so on; he hears, but the passengers do not, and <lb/>
so the ship seems to land herself without human help.</p>
<p>This great bridge is thirty or forty feet above the <lb/>
water, but the sea climbs up there sometimes; so there <lb/>
is another bridge twelve or fifteen feet higher still, for <lb/>
use in these emergencies. The force of water is a <lb/>
strange thing. It slips between one's fingers like air, <lb/>
but upon occasion it acts like a solid body and will <lb/>
bend a thin iron rod. In the <i>Havel</i> it has splintered a <lb/>
heavy oaken rail into broom-straws instead of merely <lb/>
breaking it in two, as would have been the seemingly <lb/>
natural thing for it to do. At the time of the awful <lb/>
Johnstown disaster, according to the testimony of <lb/>
several witnesses, rocks were carried some distance on <lb/>
the surface of the stupendous torrent; and at St. <lb/>
Helena, many years ago, a vast sea wave carried a <lb/>
battery of cannon forty feet up a steep slope and <lb/>
deposited the guns there in a row. But the water has <lb/>
done a still stranger thing, and it is one which is <lb/>
credibly vouched for. A marlinspike is an implement <lb/>
about a foot long which tapers from its butt to the <lb/>
other extremity and ends in a sharp point. It is made <lb/>
of iron and is heavy. A wave came aboard a ship in a <lb/>
storm and raged aft, breast high, carrying a marlin- <lb/>
spike point first with it, and with such lightning-like <lb/>
swiftness and force as to drive it three or four inches <lb/>
into a sailor's body and kill him.</p>
<pb n="465"/>
<p>In all ways the ocean greyhound of to-day is im- <lb/>
posing and impressive to one who carries in his head <lb/>
no ship pictures of a recent date. In bulk she comes <lb/>
near to rivaling the Ark; yet this monstrous mass of <lb/>
steel is driven five hundred miles through the waves in <lb/>
twenty-four hours. I remember the brag run of a <lb/>
steamer which I traveled in once on the Pacific&#x2014;it <lb/>
was two hundred and nine miles in twenty-four hours; <lb/>
a year or so later I was a passenger in the excursion <lb/>
tub <i>Quaker City</i>, and on one occasion in a level and <lb/>
glassy sea, it was claimed that she reeled off two hun- <lb/>
dred and eleven miles between noon and noon, but it <lb/>
was probably a campaign lie. That little steamer had <lb/>
seventy passengers, and a crew of forty men, and <lb/>
seemed a good deal of a beehive. But in this present <lb/>
ship we are living in a sort of solitude, these soft <lb/>
summer days, with sometimes a hundred passengers <lb/>
scattered about the spacious distances, and sometimes <lb/>
nobody in sight at all; yet, hidden somewhere in the <lb/>
vessel's bulk, there are (including crew) near eleven <lb/>
hundred people.</p>
<p>The stateliest lines in the literature of the sea are these: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Britannia needs no bulwarks, no towers along the steep&#x2014;</l>
<l>Her march is o'er the mountain waves, her home is on the deep!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>There it is. In those old times the little ships <lb/>
climbed over the waves and wallowed down into the <lb/>
trough on the other side; the giant ship of our day <lb/>
does not climb over the waves, but crushes her way <lb/>
through them. Her formidable weight and mass and <lb/>
impetus give her mastery over any but extraordinary <lb/>
storm waves.</p>
<p>The ingenuity of man! I mean in this passing <lb/>
generation. To-day I found in the chart-room a frame <lb/>
of removable wooden slats on the wall, and on the slats <lb/>
was painted uninforming information like this:</p>

<p>While I was trying to think out what kind of a game <lb/>
this might be and how a stranger might best go to <lb/>
work to beat it, a sailor came in and pulled out the <lb/>
"Empty" end of the first slat and put it back with its <lb/>
reverse side to the front, marked "Full." He made <lb/>
some other change, I did not notice what. The slat- <lb/>
frame was soon explained. Its function was to indicate <lb/>
how the ballast in the ship was distributed. The <lb/>
striking thing was that the ballast was water. I did <lb/>
not know that a ship had ever been ballasted with <lb/>
water. I had merely read, some time or other, that <lb/>
such an experiment was to be tried. But that is the <lb/>
modern way; between the experimental trial of a new <lb/>
thing and its adoption, there is no wasted time, if the <lb/>
trial proves its value.</p>
<p>On the wall, near the slat-frame, there was an outline <lb/>
drawing of the ship, and this betrayed the fact that this <lb/>
vessel has twenty-two considerable lakes of water in <lb/>
her. These lakes are in her bottom; they are im- <lb/>
prisoned between her real bottom and a false bottom. <lb/>
They are separated from each other, thwartships, by <lb/>
water-tight bulkheads, and separated down the middle <lb/>
by a bulkhead running from the bow four-fifths of the <lb/>
way to the stern. It is a chain of lakes four hundred <lb/>
feet long and from five to seven feet deep. Fourteen <lb/>
of the lakes contain fresh water brought from shore, <lb/>
and the aggregate weight of it is four hundred tons. <lb/>
The rest of the lakes contain salt water&#x2014;six hundred <lb/>
and eighteen tons. Upwards of a thousand tons of <lb/>
water, altogether.</p>
<p>Think how handy this ballast is. The ship leaves <lb/>
<pb n="467"/>
port with the lakes all full. As she lightens forward <lb/>
through consumption of coal, she loses trim&#x2014;her <lb/>
head rises, her stern sinks down. Then they spill one <lb/>
of the sternward lakes into the sea, and the trim is <lb/>
restored. This can be repeated right along as occasion <lb/>
may require. Also, a lake at one end of the ship can <lb/>
be moved to the other end by pipes and steam pumps. <lb/>
When the sailor changed the slat-frame to-day, he was <lb/>
posting a transference of that kind. The seas had <lb/>
been increasing, and the vessel's head needed more <lb/>
weighting, to keep it from rising on the waves instead <lb/>
of plowing through them; therefore, twenty-five tons <lb/>
of water had been transferred to the bow from a lake <lb/>
situated well towards the stern.</p>
<p>A water compartment is kept either full or empty. <lb/>
The body of water must be compact, so that it cannot <lb/>
slosh around. A shifting ballast would not do, of <lb/>
course.</p>
<p>The modern ship is full of beautiful ingenuities, but <lb/>
it seems to me that this one is the king. I would <lb/>
rather be the originator of that idea than of any of the <lb/>
others. Perhaps the trim of a ship was never perfectly <lb/>
ordered and preserved until now. A vessel out of trim <lb/>
will not steer, her speed is maimed, she strains and <lb/>
labors in the seas. Poor creature, for six thousand <lb/>
years she has had no comfort until these latest days. <lb/>
For six thousand years she swam through the best and <lb/>
cheapest ballast in the world, the only perfect ballast, <lb/>
but she couldn't tell her master and he had not the wit <lb/>
to find it out for himself. It is odd to reflect that there <lb/>
is nearly as much water inside of this ship as there is <lb/>
outside, and yet there is no danger.</p>

<head>NOAH'S ARK</head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> progress made in the great art of ship-building <lb/>
since Noah's time is quite noticeable. Also, the loose- <lb/>
ness of the navigation laws in the time of Noah is in <lb/>
quite striking contrast with the strictness of the naviga- <lb/>
tion laws of our time. It would not be possible for <lb/>
Noah to do in our day what he was permitted to do in <lb/>
his own. Experience has taught us the necessity of <lb/>
being more particular, more conservative, more careful <lb/>
of human life. Noah would not be allowed to sail from <lb/>
Bremen in our day. The inspectors would come and <lb/>
examine the Ark, and make all sorts of objections. A <lb/>
person who knows Germany can imagine the scene and <lb/>
the conversation without difficulty and without missing <lb/>
a detail. The inspector would be in a beautiful military <lb/>
uniform; he would be respectful, dignified, kindly, the <lb/>
perfect gentleman, but steady as the north star to the <lb/>
last requirement of his duty. He would make Noah <lb/>
tell him where he was born, and how old he was, and <lb/>
what religious sect he belonged to, and the amount of <lb/>
his income, and the grade and position he claimed <lb/>
socially, and the name and style of his occupation, and <lb/>
how many wives and children he had, and how many <lb/>
servants, and the name, sex, and age of the whole of <lb/>
them; and if he hadn't a passport he would be <lb/>
courteously required to get one right away. Then he <lb/>
would take up the matter of the Ark:</p>
<p>"What is her length?"</p>
<p>"Six hundred feet."</p>
<p>"Depth?"</p>
<p>"Sixty-five."</p>
<p>"Beam?"</p>
<p>"Fifty or sixty."</p>

<p>"Ah&#x2014;going to Chicago; good idea, too. Sur- <lb/>
geon's name?"</p>
<p>"We have no surgeon."</p>
<p>"Must provide a surgeon. Also an undertaker&#x2014; <lb/>
particularly the undertaker. These people must not be <lb/>
left without the necessities of life at their age. Crew?"</p>
<p>"The same eight."</p>
<p>"The same eight?"</p>
<p>"The same eight."</p>
<p>"And half of them women?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Have they ever served as seamen?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Where were you reared?'</p>
<p>"On a farm&#x2014;all of us."</p>
<p>"This vessel requires a crew of eight hundred men, <lb/>
she not being a steamer. You must provide them. <lb/>
She must have four mates and nine cooks. Who is <lb/>
captain?"</p>
<pb n="470"/>
<p>"I am, sir."</p>
<p>"You must get a captain. Also a chambermaid. <lb/>
Also sick nurses for the old people. Who designed <lb/>
this vessel?"</p>

<p>"Is it your first attempt?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"I partly suspected it. Cargo?"</p>
<p>"Animals."</p>

of each."</p>
<p>"Securely caged?"</p>
<p>"No, not caged."</p>
<p>"They must have iron cages. Who feeds and waters <lb/>
the menagerie?"</p>
<p>"We do."</p>
<p>"The old people?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"It is dangerous&#x2014;for both. The animals must be <lb/>
cared for by a competent force. How many animals <lb/>
are there?"</p>
<p>"Big ones, seven thousand; big and little together, <lb/>
ninety-eight thousand."</p>
<p>"You must provide twelve hundred keepers. How <lb/>
is the vessel lighted?"</p>
<p>"By two windows."</p>
<p>"Where are they?"</p>
<p>"Up under the eaves."</p>
<pb n="471"/>
<p>"Two windows for a tunnel six hundred feet long <lb/>
and sixty-five feet deep? You must put in the electric <lb/>
light&#x2014;a few arc lights and fifteen hundred incandes- <lb/>
cents. What do you do in case of leaks? How many <lb/>
pumps have you?"</p>
<p>"None, sir."</p>
<p>"You must provide pumps. How do you get water <lb/>
for the passengers and the animals?"</p>
<p>"We let down the buckets from the windows."</p>
<p>"It is inadequate. What is your motive power?"</p>
<p>"What is my which?"</p>
<p>"Motive power. What power do you use in driving <lb/>
the ship?"</p>
<p>"None."</p>
<p>"You must provide sails or steam. What is the <lb/>
nature of your steering apparatus?"</p>
<p>"We haven't any."</p>
<p>"Haven't you a rudder?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"How do you steer the vessel?"</p>
<p>"We don't."</p>
<p>"You must provide a rudder, and properly equip it. <lb/>
How many anchors have you?"</p>
<p>"None."</p>
<p>"You must provide six. One is not permitted to <lb/>
sail a vessel like this without that protection. How <lb/>
many life-boats have you?"</p>
<p>"None, sir."</p>
<p>"Provide twenty-five. How many life-preservers?"</p>
<p>"None."</p>
<p>"You will provide two thousand. How long are you <lb/>
expecting your voyage to last?"</p>
<p>"Eleven or twelve months."</p>
<p>"Eleven or twelve months. Pretty slow&#x2014;but you <lb/>
will be in time for the Exposition. What is your ship <lb/>
sheathed with&#x2014;copper?"</p>
<pb n="472"/>
<p>"Her hull is bare&#x2014;not sheathed at all."</p>
<p>"Dear man, the wood-boring creatures of the sea <lb/>
would riddle her like a sieve and send her to the bottom <lb/>
in three months. She <i>cannot</i> be allowed to go away in <lb/>
this condition; she must be sheathed. Just a word <lb/>
more: Have you reflected that Chicago is an inland <lb/>
city and not reachable with a vessel like this?"</p>
<p>"Shecargo? What is Shecargo? I am not going <lb/>
to Shecargo."</p>
<p>"Indeed? Then may I ask what the animals are <lb/>
for?"</p>
<p>"Just to breed others from."</p>
<p>"Others? Is it possible that you haven't enough?"</p>
<p>"For the present needs of civilization, yes; but the <lb/>
rest are going to be drowned in a flood, and these are <lb/>
to renew the supply."</p>
<p>"A flood?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly sure. It is going to rain forty days and <lb/>
forty nights."</p>
<p>"Give yourself no concern about that, dear sir, it <lb/>
often does that here."</p>
<p>"Not this kind of rain. This is going to cover the <lb/>
mountain tops, and the earth will pass from sight."</p>
<p>"Privately&#x2014;but of course not officially&#x2014;I am <lb/>
sorry you revealed this, for it compels me to withdraw <lb/>
the option I gave you as to sails or steam. I must <lb/>
require you to use steam. Your ship cannot carry the <lb/>
hundredth part of an eleven-months water supply for <lb/>
the animals. You will have to have condensed water."</p>
<p>"But I tell you I am going to dip water from out- <lb/>
side with buckets."</p>
<p>"It will not answer. Before the flood reaches the <lb/>
mountain tops the fresh waters will have joined the salt <lb/>
seas, and it will all be salt. You must put in steam <lb/>
<pb n="473"/>
and condense your water. I will now bid you good <lb/>
day, sir. Did I understand you to say that this was <lb/>
your very first attempt at ship building?"</p>
<p>"My very first, sir, I give you the honest truth. I <lb/>
built this Ark without having ever had the slightest <lb/>
training or experience or instruction in marine architec- <lb/>
ture."</p>
<p>"It is a remarkable work, sir, a most remarkable <lb/>
work. I consider that it contains more features that <lb/>
are new&#x2014;absolutely new and unhackneyed&#x2014;than <lb/>
are to be found in any other vessel that swims the <lb/>
seas."</p>
<p>"This compliment does me infinite honor, dear sir, <lb/>
infinite; and I shall cherish the memory of it while life <lb/>
shall last. Sir, I offer my duty and most grateful <lb/>
thanks. Adieu."</p>
<p>No, the German inspector would be limitlessly courte- <lb/>
ous to Noah, and would make him feel that he was <lb/>
among friends, but he wouldn't let him go to sea with <lb/>
that Ark.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head>COLUMBUS'S CRAFT</head>
<p><smcap>Between</smcap> Noah's time and the time of Columbus <lb/>
naval architecture underwent some changes, and from <lb/>
being unspeakably bad was improved to a point which <lb/>
may be described as less unspeakably bad. I have <lb/>
read somewhere, some time or other, that one of <lb/>
Columbus's ships was a ninety-ton vessel. By com- <lb/>
paring that ship with the ocean greyhounds of our time <lb/>
one is able to get down to a comprehension of how <lb/>
small that Spanish bark was, and how little fitted she <lb/>
would be to run opposition in the Atlantic passenger <lb/>
trade to-day. It would take seventy-four of her to <lb/>
match the tonnage of the <i>Havel</i> and carry the <i>Havel's</i> <lb/>
<pb n="474"/>
trip. If I remember rightly, it took her ten weeks to <lb/>
make the passage. With our ideas this would now be <lb/>
considered an objectionable gait. She probably had a <lb/>
captain, a mate, and a crew consisting of four seamen <lb/>
and a boy. The crew of a modern greyhound numbers <lb/>
two hundred and fifty persons.</p>
<p>Columbus's ship being small and very old, we know <lb/>
that we may draw from these two facts several absolute <lb/>
certainties in the way of minor details which history <lb/>
has left unrecorded. For instance: being small, we <lb/>
know that she rolled and pitched and tumbled in any <lb/>
ordinary sea, and stood on her head or her tail, or lay <lb/>
down with her ear in the water, when storm seas ran <lb/>
high; also, that she was used to having billows plunge <lb/>
aboard and wash her decks from stem to stern; also, <lb/>
that the storm racks were on the table all the way over, <lb/>
and that nevertheless a man's soup was oftener landed <lb/>
in his lap than in his stomach; also, that the dining- <lb/>
saloon was about ten feet by seven, dark, airless, and <lb/>
suffocating with oil-stench; also, that there was only <lb/>
about one stateroom, the size of a grave, with a tier of <lb/>
two or three berths in it of the dimensions and com- <lb/>
fortableness of coffins, and that when the light was out <lb/>
the darkness in there was so thick and real that you <lb/>
could bite into it and chew it like gum; also, that the <lb/>
only promenade was on the lofty poop-deck astern <lb/>
(for the ship was shaped like a high-quarter shoe)&#x2014;a <lb/>
streak sixteen feet long by three feet wide, all the rest <lb/>
of the vessel being littered with ropes and flooded by <lb/>
the seas.</p>
<p>We know all these things to be true, from the mere <lb/>
fact that we know the vessel was small. As the vessel <lb/>
was old, certain other truths follow, as matters of <lb/>
course. For instance: she was full of rats; she was <lb/>
full of cockroaches; the heavy seas made her seams <lb/>
open and shut like your fingers, and she leaked like a <lb/>
<pb n="475"/>
basket; where leakage is, there also, of necessity, is <lb/>
bilgewater; and where bilgewater is, only the dead can <lb/>
enjoy life. This is on account of the smell. In the <lb/>
presence of bilgewater, Limburger cheese becomes <lb/>
odorless and ashamed.</p>
<p>From these absolutely sure data we can competently <lb/>
picture the daily life of the great discoverer. In the <lb/>
early morning he paid his devotions at the shrine of <lb/>
the Virgin. At eight bells he appeared on the poop- <lb/>
deck promenade. If the weather was chilly he came <lb/>
up clad from plumed helmet to spurred heel in mag- <lb/>
nificent plate armor inlaid with arabesques of gold, <lb/>
having previously warmed it at the galley fire. If the <lb/>
weather was warm he came up in the ordinary sailor <lb/>
toggery of the time&#x2014;great slouch hat of blue velvet <lb/>
with a flowing brush of snowy ostrich plumes, fastened <lb/>
on with a flashing cluster of diamonds and emeralds; <lb/>
gold-embroidered doublet of green velvet with slashed <lb/>
sleeves exposing under-sleeves of crimson satin; deep <lb/>
collar and cuff ruffles of rich limp lace; trunk hose of <lb/>
pink velvet, with big knee-knots of brocaded yellow <lb/>
ribbon; pearl-tinted silk stockings, clocked and daintily <lb/>
embroidered; lemon-colored buskins of unborn kid, <lb/>
funnel-topped, and drooping low to expose the pretty <lb/>
stockings; deep gauntlets of finest white heretic skin, <lb/>
from the factory of the Holy Inquisition, formerly <lb/>
part of the person of a lady of rank; rapier with <lb/>
sheath crusted with jewels, and hanging from a broad <lb/>
baldric upholstered with rubies and sapphires.</p>
<p>He walked the promenade thoughtfully, he noted the <lb/>
aspects of the sky and the course of the wind; he kept <lb/>
an eye out for drifting vegetation and other signs of <lb/>
land; he jawed the man at the wheel for pastime; he <lb/>
got out an imitation egg and kept himself in practice <lb/>
on his old trick of making it stand on its end; now and <lb/>
then he hove a life-line below and fished up a sailor <lb/>
<pb n="476"/>
who was drowning on the quarter-deck; the rest of his <lb/>
watch he gaped and yawned and stretched, and said he <lb/>
wouldn't make the trip again to discover six Americas. <lb/>
For that was the kind of natural human person Colum- <lb/>
bus was when not posing for posterity.</p>
<p>At noon he took the sun and ascertained that the <lb/>
good ship had made three hundred yards in twenty- <lb/>
four hours, and this enabled him to win the pool. <lb/>
Anybody can win the pool when nobody but himself <lb/>
has the privilege of straightening out the ship's run and <lb/>
getting it right.</p>
<p>The Admiral has breakfasted alone, in state: bacon, <lb/>
beans, and gin; at noon he dines alone, in state: bacon, <lb/>
beans, and gin; at six he sups alone, in state: bacon, <lb/>
beans, and gin; at eleven <smcap>p. m.</smcap> he takes a night <lb/>
relish alone, in state: bacon, beans, and gin. At none <lb/>
of these orgies is there any music; the ship orchestra <lb/>
is modern. After his final meal he returned thanks for <lb/>
his many blessings, a little overrating their value, per- <lb/>
haps, and then he laid off his silken splendors or his <lb/>
gilded hardware, and turned in, in his little coffin-bunk, <lb/>
and blew out his flickering stencher and began to re- <lb/>
fresh his lungs with inverted sighs freighted with the <lb/>
rich odors of rancid oil and bilgewater. The sighs <lb/>
returned as snores, and then the rats and the cock- <lb/>
roaches swarmed out in brigades and divisions and <lb/>
army corps and had a circus all over him. Such was <lb/>
the daily life of the great discoverer in his marine <lb/>
basket during several historic weeks; and the difference <lb/>
between his ship and his comforts and ours is visible <lb/>
almost at a glance.</p>
<p>When he returned, the King of Spain, marveling, <lb/>
said&#x2014;as history records:</p>
<p>"This ship seems to be leaky. Did she leak <lb/>
badly?"</p>
<p>"You shall judge for yourself, sire. I pumped the <lb/>
<pb n="477"/>
Atlantic Ocean through her sixteen times on the <lb/>
passage."</p>
<p>This is General Horace Porter's account. Other <lb/>
authorities say fifteen.</p>
<p>It can be shown that the differences between that <lb/>
ship and the one I am writing these historical contribu- <lb/>
tions in are in several respects remarkable. Take the <lb/>
matter of decoration, for instance. I have been look- <lb/>
ing around again, yesterday and to-day, and have <lb/>
noted several details which I conceive to have been <lb/>
absent from Columbus's ship, or at least slurred over <lb/>
and not elaborated and perfected. I observe stateroom <lb/>
doors three inches thick, of solid oak and polished. I <lb/>
note companion-way vestibules with walls, doors, and <lb/>
ceilings paneled in polished hardwoods, some light, <lb/>
some dark, all dainty and delicate joiner-work, and yet <lb/>
every joint compact and tight; with beautiful pictures <lb/>
inserted, composed of blue tiles&#x2014;some of the pictures <lb/>
containing as many as sixty tiles&#x2014;and the joinings of <lb/>
those tiles perfect. These are daring experiments. <lb/>
One would have said that the first time the ship went <lb/>
straining and laboring through a storm-tumbled sea <lb/>
those tiles would gape apart and drop out. That they <lb/>
have not done so is evidence that the joiner's art has <lb/>
advanced a good deal since the days when ships were <lb/>
so shackly that when a giant sea gave them a wrench <lb/>
the doors came unbolted. I find the walls of the <lb/>
dining-saloon upholstered with mellow pictures wrought <lb/>
in tapestry and the ceiling aglow with pictures done in <lb/>
oil. In other places of assembly I find great panels <lb/>
filled with embossed Spanish leather, the figures rich <lb/>
with gilding and bronze. Everywhere I find sumptuous <lb/>
masses of color&#x2014;color, color, color&#x2014;color all <lb/>
about, color of every shade and tint and variety; and, <lb/>
as a result, the ship is bright and cheery to the eye, <lb/>
and this cheeriness invades one's spirit and contents it. <lb/>
<pb n="478"/>
To fully appreciate the force and spritual value of this <lb/>
radiant and opulent dream of color, one must stand <lb/>
outside at night in the pitch dark and the rain, and <lb/>
look in through a port, and observe it in the lavish <lb/>
splendor of the electric lights. The old-time ships <lb/>
were dull, plain, graceless, gloomy, and horribly de- <lb/>
pressing. They compelled the blues; one could not <lb/>
escape the blues in them. The modern idea is right: <lb/>
to surround the passenger with conveniences, luxuries, <lb/>
and abundance of inspiriting color. As a result, this <lb/>
ship is the pleasantest place one can be in, except, <lb/>
perhaps, one's home.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head>A VANISHED SENTIMENT</head>
<p><smcap>One</smcap> thing is gone, to return no more forever&#x2014;the <lb/>
romance of the sea. Soft sentimentality about the sea <lb/>
has retired from the activities of this life, and is but a <lb/>
memory of the past, already remote and much faded. <lb/>
But within the recollection of men still living, it was in <lb/>
the breast of every individual; and the further any <lb/>
individual lived from salt water the more of it he kept <lb/>
in stock. It was as pervasive, as universal, as the <lb/>
atmosphere itself. The mere mention of the sea, the <lb/>
romantic sea, would make any company of people <lb/>
sentimental and mawkish at once. The great majority <lb/>
of the songs that were sung by the young people of <lb/>
the back settlements had the melancholy wanderer for <lb/>
subject and his mouthings about the sea for refrain. <lb/>
Picnic parties paddling down a creek in a canoe when <lb/>
the twilight shadows were gathering always sang: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Homeward bound, homeward bound</l>
<l>From a foreign shore;</l>
</lg></q>
and this was also a favorite in the West with the <lb/>
<pb n="479"/>
passengers on sternwheel steamboats. There was <lb/>
another: <lb/>

<l>My boat is by the shore</l>
<l rend="indent">And my bark is on the sea,</l>

<p>And this one, also: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">

<l>There's danger on the deep.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>And this: <lb/>

<l>A life on the ocean wave</l>
<l rend="indent">And a home on the rolling deep,</l>
<l>Where the scattered waters rave</l>
<l rend="indent">And the winds their revels keep!</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>And this: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">

<p>And this: <lb/>

<l>My foot is on my gallant deck,</l>
<l>Once more the rover is free!</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>And the "Larboard Watch"&#x2014;the person referred <lb/>
to below is at the masthead, or somewhere up there: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Oh, who can tell what joy he feels,</l>
<l>As o'er the foam his vessel reels,</l>

<l rend="indent">Of "Larboard watch&#x2014;ahoy!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Yes, and there was forever and always some jackass- <lb/>

<q><lg type="group">
<l>Rocked in the cradle of the deep,</l>
<l>I lay me down in peace to sleep!</l>

<p>Other favorites had these suggestive titles: "The <lb/>

<pb n="480"/>
Boy's Dream;" "The Captive Pirate's Lament;" <lb/>
"We are far from Home on the Stormy Main"&#x2014; <lb/>
and so on, and so on, the list is endless. Everybody <lb/>
on a farm lived chiefly amid the dangers of the deep in <lb/>
those days, in fancy.</p>
<p>But all that is gone now. Not a vestige of it is left. <lb/>
The iron-clad, with her unsentimental aspect and frigid <lb/>
attention to business, banished romance from the war <lb/>
marine, and the unsentimental steamer has banished it <lb/>
from the commercial marine. The dangers and uncer- <lb/>
tainties which made sea life romantic have disappeared <lb/>
and carried the poetic element along with them. In <lb/>
our day the passengers never sing sea-songs on board <lb/>
a ship, and the band never plays them. Pathetic songs <lb/>
about the wanderer in strange lands far from home, <lb/>
once so popular and contributing such fire and color to <lb/>
the imagination by reason of the rarity of that kind of <lb/>
wanderer, have lost their charm and fallen silent, be- <lb/>
cause everybody is a wanderer in the far lands now, <lb/>
and the interest in that detail is dead. Nobody is <lb/>
worried about the wanderer; there are no perils of the <lb/>
sea for him, there are no uncertainties. He is safer in <lb/>
the ship than he would probably be at home, for there <lb/>
he is always liable to have to attend some friend's <lb/>
funeral and stand over the grave in the sleet, bare- <lb/>
headed&#x2014;and that means pneumonia for him, if he <lb/>
gets his deserts; and the uncertainties of his voyage <lb/>
are reduced to whether he will arrive on the other side <lb/>
in the appointed afternoon, or have to wait till morning.</p>
<p>The first ship I was ever in was a sailing vessel. She <lb/>
was twenty-eight days going from San Francisco to the <lb/>
Sandwich Islands. But the main reason for this par- <lb/>
ticularly slow passage was that she got becalmed and <lb/>
lay in one spot fourteen days in the center of the <lb/>
Pacific two thousand miles from land. I hear no sea- <lb/>
songs in this present vessel, but I heard the entire lay- <lb/>
<pb n="481"/>
out in that one. There were a dozen young people&#x2014; <lb/>
they are pretty old now, I reckon&#x2014;and they used to <lb/>
group themselves on the stern, in the starlight or the <lb/>
moonlight, every evening, and sing sea-songs till after <lb/>
midnight, in that hot, silent, motionless calm. They <lb/>
had no sense of humor, and they always sang "Home- <lb/>
ward Bound," without reflecting that that was practi- <lb/>
cally ridiculous, since they were standing still and not <lb/>
proceeding in any direction at all; and they often <lb/>
followed that song with "'Are we almost there, are we <lb/>
almost there,' said the dying girl as she drew near <lb/>
home?"</p>
<p>It was a very pleasant company of young people, <lb/>
and I wonder where they are now. Gone, oh, none <lb/>
knows whither; and the bloom and grace and beauty <lb/>
of their youth, where is that? Among them was a <lb/>
liar; all tried to reform him, but none could do it. <lb/>
And so, gradually, he was left to himself; none of us <lb/>
would associate with him. Many a time since I have <lb/>
seen in fancy that forsaken figure, leaning forlorn <lb/>
against the taffrail, and have reflected that perhaps if <lb/>
we had tried harder, and been more patient, we might <lb/>
have won him from his fault and persuaded him to <lb/>
relinquish it. But it is hard to tell; with him the vice <lb/>
was extreme, and was probably incurable. I like to <lb/>
think&#x2014;and, indeed, I do think&#x2014;that I did the best <lb/>
that in me lay to lead him to higher and better ways.</p>
<p>There was a singular circumstance. The ship lay <lb/>
becalmed that entire fortnight in exactly the same spot. <lb/>
Then a handsome breeze came fanning over the sea, <lb/>
and we spread our white wings for flight. But the <lb/>
vessel did not budge. The sails bellied out, the gale <lb/>
strained at the ropes, but the vessel moved not a hair's <lb/>
breadth from her place. The captain was surprised. <lb/>
It was some hours before we found out what the cause <lb/>
of the detention was. It was barnacles. They collect <lb/>
<pb n="482"/>
very fast in that part of the Pacific. They had fastened <lb/>
themselves to the ship's bottom; then others had <lb/>
fastened themselves to the first bunch, others to these, <lb/>
and so on, down and down and down, and the last <lb/>
bunch had glued the column hard and fast to the <lb/>
bottom of the sea, which is five miles deep at that <lb/>
point. So the ship was simply become the handle of a <lb/>
walking cane five miles long&#x2014;yes, and no more <lb/>
movable by wind and sail than a continent is. It was <lb/>
regarded by every one as remarkable.</p>
<p>Well, the next week&#x2014;however, Sandy Hook is in <lb/>
sight.</p>

<head><b>PLAYING COURIER</b></head>
<p><smcap>A time</smcap> would come when we must go from Aix- <lb/>
les-Bains to Geneva, and from thence, by a series <lb/>
of day-long and tangled journeys, to Bayreuth in <lb/>
Bavaria. I should have to have a courier, of course, to <lb/>
take care of so considerable a party as mine.</p>
<p>But I procrastinated. The time slipped along, and <lb/>
at last I woke up one day to the fact that we were <lb/>
ready to move and had no courier. I then resolved <lb/>
upon what I felt was a foolhardy thing, but I was in <lb/>
the humor of it. I said I would make the first stage <lb/>
without help&#x2014;I did it.</p>
<p>I brought the party from Aix to Geneva by myself <lb/>
&#x2014;four people. The distance was two hours and more, <lb/>
and there was one change of cars. There was not an <lb/>
accident of any kind, except leaving a valise and some <lb/>
other matters on the platform&#x2014;a thing which can <lb/>
hardly be called an accident, it is so common. So I <lb/>
offered to conduct the party all the way to Bayreuth.</p>
<p>This was a blunder, though it did not seem so at the <lb/>
time. There was more detail than I thought there <lb/>
would be: 1, two persons whom we had left in a <lb/>
Geneva pension some weeks before must be collected <lb/>
and brought to the hotel; 2, I must notify the people <lb/>
on the Grand Quay who store trunks to bring seven of <lb/>
our stored trunks to the hotel and carry back seven <lb/>
which they would find piled in the lobby; 3, I must <lb/>
find out what part of Europe Bayreuth was in and buy <lb/>
seven railway tickets for that point; 4, I must send a <lb/>
<pb n="484"/>
telegram to a friend in the Netherlands; 5, it was now <lb/>
two in the afternoon, and we must look sharp and be <lb/>
ready for the first night train and make sure of sleeping- <lb/>
car tickets; 6, I must draw money at the bank.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the sleeping-car tickets must <lb/>
be the most important thing, so I went to the station <lb/>
myself to make sure; hotel messengers are not always <lb/>
brisk people. It was a hot day and I ought to have <lb/>
driven, but it seemed better economy to walk. It did <lb/>
not turn out so, because I lost my way and trebled the <lb/>
distance. I applied for the tickets, and they asked me <lb/>
which route I wanted to go by, and that embarrassed <lb/>
me and made me lose my head, there were so many <lb/>
people standing around, and I not knowing anything <lb/>
about the routes and not supposing there were going <lb/>
to be two; so I judged it best to go back and map out <lb/>
the road and come again.</p>
<p>I took a cab this time, but on my way upstairs at <lb/>
the hotel I remembered that I was out of cigars, so I <lb/>
thought it would be well to get some while the matter <lb/>
was in my mind. It was only round the corner and I <lb/>
didn't need the cab. I asked the cabman to wait <lb/>
where he was. Thinking of the telegram and trying to <lb/>
word it in my head, I forgot the cigars and the cab, <lb/>
and walked on indefinitely. I was going to have the <lb/>
hotel people send the telegram, but as I could not be <lb/>
far from the post-office by this time, I thought I would <lb/>
do it myself. But it was further than I had supposed. <lb/>
I found the place at last and wrote the telegram and <lb/>
handed it in. The clerk was a severe-looking, fidgety <lb/>
man, and he began to fire French questions at me in <lb/>
such a liquid form that I could not detect the joints <lb/>
between his words, and this made me lose my head <lb/>
again. But an Englishman stepped up and said the <lb/>
clerk wanted to know where he was to send the tele- <lb/>
gram. I could not tell him, because it was not my <lb/>
<pb n="485"/>
telegram, and I explained that I was merely sending it <lb/>
for a member of my party. But nothing would pacify <lb/>
the clerk but the address; so I said that if he was so <lb/>
particular I would go back and get it.</p>
<p>However, I thought I would go and collect those <lb/>
lacking two persons first, for it would be best to do <lb/>
everything systematically and in order, and one detail <lb/>
at a time. Then I remembered the cab was eating up <lb/>
my substance down at the hotel yonder; so I called <lb/>
another cab and told the man to go down and fetch it <lb/>
to the post-office and wait till I came.</p>
<p>I had a long hot walk to collect those people, and <lb/>
when I got there they couldn't come with me because <lb/>
they had heavy satchels and must have a cab. I went <lb/>
away to find one, but before I ran across any I noticed <lb/>
that I had reached the neighborhood of the Grand <lb/>
Quay&#x2014;at least I thought I had&#x2014;so I judged I could <lb/>
save time by stepping around and arranging about the <lb/>
trunks. I stepped around about a mile, and although <lb/>
I did not find the Grand Quay, I found a cigar shop, <lb/>
and remembered about the cigars. I said I was going <lb/>
to Bayreuth, and wanted enough for the journey. The <lb/>
man asked me which route I was going to take. I said <lb/>
I did not know. He said he would recommend me to <lb/>
go by Zurich and various other places which he named, <lb/>
and offered to sell me seven second-class through <lb/>
tickets for &#x0024;22 apiece, which would be throwing off <lb/>
the discount which the railroads allowed him. I was <lb/>
already tired of riding second-class on first-class tickets, <lb/>
so I took him up.</p>
<p>By and by I found Natural &amp; Co.'s storage office, <lb/>
and told them to send seven of our trunks to the hotel <lb/>
and pile them up in the lobby. It seemed to me that <lb/>
I was not delivering the whole of the message, still it <lb/>
was all I could find in my head.</p>
<p>Next I found the bank and asked for some money, <lb/>
<pb n="486"/>
but I had left my letter of credit somewhere and was <lb/>
not able to draw. I remembered now that I must have <lb/>
left it lying on the table where I wrote my telegram; <lb/>
so I got a cab and drove to the post-office and went <lb/>
upstairs, and they said that a letter of credit had indeed <lb/>
been left on the table, but that it was now in the hands <lb/>
of the police authorities, and it would be necessary for <lb/>
me to go there and prove property. They sent a boy <lb/>
with me, and we went out the back way and walked a <lb/>
couple of miles and found the place; and then I re- <lb/>
membered about my cabs, and asked the boy to send <lb/>
them to me when he got back to the post-office. It <lb/>
was nightfall now, and the Mayor had gone to dinner. <lb/>
I thought I would go to dinner myself, but the officer <lb/>
on duty thought differently, and I stayed. The Mayor <lb/>
dropped in at half-past ten, but said it was too late to <lb/>
do anything to-night&#x2014;come at 9:30 in the morning. <lb/>
The officer wanted to keep me all night, and said I was <lb/>
a suspicious looking person, and probably did not own <lb/>
the letter of credit, and didn't know what a letter of <lb/>
credit was, but merely saw the real owner leave it lying <lb/>
on the table, and wanted to get it because I was <lb/>
probably a person that would want anything he could <lb/>
get, whether it was valuable or not. But the Mayor <lb/>
said he saw nothing suspicious about me, and that I <lb/>
seemed a harmless person and nothing the matter with <lb/>
me but a wandering mind, and not much of that. So <lb/>
I thanked him and he set me free, and I went home in <lb/>
my three cabs.</p>
<p>As I was dog-tired and in no condition to answer <lb/>
questions with discretion, I thought I would not disturb <lb/>
the Expedition at that time of night, as there was a <lb/>
vacant room I knew of at the other end of the hall; <lb/>
but I did not quite arrive there, as a watch had been <lb/>
set, the Expedition being anxious about me. I was <lb/>
placed in a galling situation. The Expedition sat stiff <lb/>
<pb n="487"/>
and forbidding on four chairs in a row, with shawls and <lb/>
things all on, satchels and guide-books in lap. They <lb/>
had been sitting like that for four hours, and the glass <lb/>
going down all the time. Yes, and they were waiting <lb/>
&#x2014;waiting for me. It seemed to me that nothing but <lb/>
a sudden, happily contrived, and brilliant <i>tour de force</i> <lb/>
could break this iron front and make a diversion in my <lb/>
favor; so I shied my hat into the arena and followed it <lb/>
with a skip and a jump, shouting blithely:</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, here we all are, Mr. Merryman!"</p>
<p>Nothing could be deeper or stiller than the absence <lb/>
of applause which followed. But I kept on; there <lb/>
seemed no other way, though my confidence, poor <lb/>
enough before, had got a deadly check and was in <lb/>
effect gone.</p>
<p>I tried to be jocund out of a heavy heart, I tried to <lb/>
touch the other hearts there and soften the bitter re- <lb/>
sentment in those faces by throwing off bright and airy <lb/>
fun and making of the whole ghastly thing a joyously <lb/>
humorous incident, but this idea was not well con- <lb/>
ceived. It was not the right atmosphere for it. I got <lb/>
not one smile; not one line in those offended faces <lb/>
relaxed; I thawed nothing of the winter that looked <lb/>
out of those frosty eyes. I started one more breezy, <lb/>
poor effort, but the head of the Expedition cut into <lb/>
the center of it and said:</p>
<p>"Where have you been?"</p>
<p>I saw by the manner of this that the idea was to get <lb/>
down to cold business now. So I began my travels, <lb/>
but was cut short again.</p>
<p>"Where are the two others? We have been in <lb/>
frightful anxiety about them."</p>
<p>"Oh, they're all right. I was to fetch a cab. I will <lb/>
go straight off, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Sit down! Don't you know it is eleven o'clock? <lb/>
Where did you leave them?"</p>
<pb n="488"/>
<p>"At the pension."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you bring them?"</p>
<p>"Because we couldn't carry the satchels. And so <lb/>
I thought&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Thought! You should not try to think. One <lb/>
cannot think without the proper machinery. It is two <lb/>
miles to that pension. Did you go there without a <lb/>
cab?"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;well I didn't intend to; it only happened so."</p>
<p>"How did it happen so?"</p>
<p>"Because I was at the post-office and I remembered <lb/>
that I had left a cab waiting here, and so, to stop that <lb/>
expense, I sent another cab to&#x2014;to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"To what?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't remember now, but I think the new <lb/>
cab was to have the hotel pay the old cab, and send it <lb/>
away."</p>
<p>"What good would that do?"</p>
<p>"What good would it do? It would stop the ex- <lb/>
pense, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"By putting the new cab in its place to continue <lb/>
the expense?"</p>
<p>I didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you have the new cab come back for <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that is what I did. I remember now. Yes, <lb/>
that is what I did. Because I recollect that when I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, then, why didn't it come back for you?"</p>
<p>"To the post-office? Why, it did."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, how did you come to walk to the <lb/>
pension?"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;I don't quite remember how that happened. <lb/>
Oh, yes, I do remember now. I wrote the dispatch to <lb/>
send to the Netherlands, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, thank goodness, you did accomplish some- <lb/>
thing! I wouldn't have had you fail to send&#x2014;what <lb/>
<pb n="489"/>
makes you look like that! You are trying to avoid <lb/>
my eye. That dispatch is the most important thing <lb/>
that&#x2014;You haven't sent that dispatch!"</p>
<p>"I haven't said I didn't send it."</p>
<p>"You don't need to. Oh, dear, I wouldn't have <lb/>
had that telegram fail for anything. Why didn't you <lb/>
send it?"</p>
<p>"Well, you see, with so many things to do and <lb/>
think of, I&#x2014;they're very particular there, and after I <lb/>
had written the telegram&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind, let it go, explanations can't help <lb/>
the matter now&#x2014;what will he think of us?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right, that's all right, he'll think <lb/>
we gave the telegram to the hotel people, and that <lb/>
they&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why, certainly! Why didn't you do that? There <lb/>
was no other rational way."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know, but then I had it on my mind that I <lb/>
must be sure and get to the bank and draw some <lb/>
money&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, you are entitled to some credit, after all, for <lb/>
thinking of that, and I don't wish to be too hard on <lb/>
you, though you must acknowledge yourself that you <lb/>
have cost us all a good deal of trouble, and some of it <lb/>
not necessary. How much did you draw?"</p>
<p>"Well, I&#x2014;I had an idea that&#x2014;that&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"That what?"</p>
<p>"That&#x2014;well, it seems to me that in the circum- <lb/>
stances&#x2014;so many of us, you know, and&#x2014;and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What are you mooning about? Do turn your face <lb/>
this way and let me&#x2014;why, you haven't drawn any <lb/>
money!"</p>
<p>"Well, the banker said&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Never mind what the banker said. You must <lb/>
have had a reason of your own. Not a reason, exactly, <lb/>
but something which&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="490"/>
<p>"Well, then, the simple fact was that I hadn't my <lb/>
letter of credit."</p>
<p>"Hadn't your letter of credit?"</p>
<p>"Hadn't my letter of credit."</p>
<p>"Don't repeat me like that. Where was it?"</p>
<p>"At the post-office."</p>
<p>"What was it doing there?"</p>
<p>"Well, I forgot it and left it there."</p>
<p>"Upon my word, I've seen a good many couriers, <lb/>
but of all the couriers that ever I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I've done the best I could."</p>
<p>"Well, so you have, poor thing, and I'm wrong to <lb/>
abuse you so when you've been working yourself to <lb/>
death while we've been sitting here only thinking of <lb/>
our vexations instead of feeling grateful for what you <lb/>
were trying to do for us. It will all come out right. <lb/>
We can take the 7.30 train in the morning just as well. <lb/>
You've bought the tickets?"</p>
<p>"I have&#x2014;and it's a bargain, too. Second class."</p>
<p>"I'm glad of it. Everybody else travels second <lb/>
class, and we might just as well save that ruinous extra <lb/>
charge. What did you pay?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-two dollars apiece&#x2014;through to Bayreuth."</p>
<p>"Why, I didn't know you could buy through tickets <lb/>
anywhere but in London and Paris."</p>
<p>"Some people can't, maybe; but some people can <lb/>
&#x2014;of whom I am one of which, it appears."</p>
<p>"It seems a rather high price."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, the dealer knocked off his com- <lb/>
mission."</p>
<p>"Dealer?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;I bought them at a cigar shop."</p>
<p>"That reminds me. We shall have to get up pretty <lb/>
early, and so there should be no packing to do. Your <lb/>
umbrella, your rubbers, your cigars&#x2014;what is the <lb/>
matter?"</p>
<pb n="491"/>
<p>"Hang it, I've left the cigars at the bank."</p>
<p>"Just think of it! Well, your umbrella?"</p>
<p>"I'll have that all right. There's no hurry."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right; I'll take care of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Where is that umbrella?"</p>
<p>"It's just the merest step&#x2014;it won't take me&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>"Well, I think I left it at the cigar shop; but any- <lb/>
way&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Take your feet out from under that thing. It's <lb/>
just as I expected! Where are your rubbers?"</p>
<p>"They&#x2014;well&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Where are your rubbers?"</p>
<p>"It's got so dry now&#x2014;well, everybody says there's <lb/>
not going to be another drop of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Where&#x2014;are&#x2014;your&#x2014;rubbers?"</p>
<p>"Well, you see&#x2014;well, it was this way. First, the <lb/>
officer said&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What officer?"</p>
<p>"Police officer; but the Mayor, he</p>
<p>"What Mayor?"</p>
<p>"Mayor of Geneva; but I said&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Wait. What is the matter with you?"</p>
<p>"Who, me? Nothing. They both tried to persuade <lb/>
me to stay, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Stay where?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;the fact is&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Where have you been? What's kept you out till <lb/>
half-past ten at night?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you see, after I lost my letter of credit, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"You are beating around the bush a good deal. <lb/>
Now, answer the question in just one straightforward <lb/>
word. Where are those rubbers?"</p>
<p>"They&#x2014;well; they're in the county jail."</p>
<p>I started a placating smile, but it petrified. The <lb/>
<pb n="492"/>
climate was unsuitable. Spending three or four nours <lb/>
in jail did not seem to the Expedition humorous. <lb/>
Neither did it to me, at bottom.</p>
<p>I had to explain the whole thing, and, of course, it <lb/>
came out then that we couldn't take the early train, <lb/>
because that would leave my letter of credit in hock <lb/>
still. It did look as if we had all got to go to bed <lb/>
estranged and unhappy, but by good luck that was <lb/>
prevented. There happened to be mention of the <lb/>
trunks, and I was able to say I had attended to that <lb/>
feature.</p>
<p>"There, you are just as good and thoughtful and <lb/>
painstaking and intelligent as you can be, and it's a <lb/>
shame to find so much fault with you, and there sha'n't <lb/>
be another word of it. You've done beautifully, ad- <lb/>
mirably, and I'm sorry I ever said one ungrateful word <lb/>
to you."</p>
<p>This hit deeper than some of the other things and <lb/>
made me uncomfortable, because I wasn't feeling as <lb/>
solid about that trunk errand as I wanted to. There <lb/>
seemed somehow to be a defect about it somewhere, <lb/>
though I couldn't put my finger on it, and didn't like <lb/>
to stir the matter just now, it being late and maybe well <lb/>
enough to let well enough alone.</p>
<p>Of course, there was music in the morning, when it <lb/>
was found that we couldn't leave by the early train. <lb/>
But I had no time to wait; I got only the opening bars <lb/>
of the overture, and then started out to get my letter <lb/>
of credit.</p>
<p>It seemed a good time to look into the trunk business <lb/>
and rectify it if it needed it, and I had a suspicion that <lb/>
it did. I was too late. The concierge said he had <lb/>
shipped the trunks to Zurich the evening before. I <lb/>
asked him how he could do that without exhibiting <lb/>
passage tickets.</p>
<p>"Not necessary in Switzerland. You pay for your <lb/>
<pb n="493"/>
trunks and send them where you please. Nothing goes <lb/>
free but your hand baggage."</p>
<p>"How much did you pay on them?"</p>
<p>"A hundred and forty francs."</p>
<p>"Twenty-eight dollars. There's something wrong <lb/>
about that trunk business, sure."</p>
<p>Next I met the porter. He said:</p>
<p>"You have not slept well, is it not. You have the <lb/>
worn look. If you would like a courier, a good one <lb/>
has arrived last night, and is not engaged for five days <lb/>
already, by the name of Ludi. We recommend him; <lb/>
das heisst, the Grand H&#x00F4;tel Beau Rivage recommends <lb/>
him."</p>
<p>I declined with coldness. My spirit was not broken <lb/>
yet. And I did not like having my condition taken <lb/>
notice of in this way. I was at the county jail by nine <lb/>
o'clock, hoping that the Mayor might chance to come <lb/>
before his regular hour; but he didn't. It was dull <lb/>
there. Every time I offered to touch anything, or <lb/>
look at anything, or do anything, or refrain from doing <lb/>
anything, the policeman said it was "d&#x00E9;fendu." I <lb/>
thought I would practice my French on him, but he <lb/>
wouldn't have that either. It seemed to make him <lb/>
particularly bitter to hear his own tongue.</p>
<p>The Mayor came at last, and then there was no <lb/>
trouble; for the minute he had convened the Supreme <lb/>
Court&#x2014;they always do whenever there is valuable <lb/>
property in dispute&#x2014;and got everything shipshape <lb/>
and sentries posted, and had prayer by the chaplain; <lb/>
my unsealed letter was brought and opened, and there <lb/>
wasn't anything in it but some photographs; because, <lb/>
as I remembered now, I had taken out the letter of <lb/>
credit so as to make room for the photographs, and <lb/>
had put the letter in my other pocket, which I proved <lb/>
to everybody's satisfaction by fetching it out and show- <lb/>
ing it with a good deal of exultation. So then the <lb/>
<pb n="494"/>
court looked at each other in a vacant kind of way, <lb/>
and then at me, and then at each other again, and <lb/>
finally let me go, but said it was imprudent for me to <lb/>
be at large, and asked me what my profession was. I <lb/>
said I was a courier. They lifted up their eyes in a <lb/>
kind of reverent way and said, "Du lieber Gott!" and <lb/>
I said a word of courteous thanks for their apparent <lb/>
admiration, and hurried off to the bank.</p>
<p>However, being a courier was already making me a <lb/>
great stickler for order and system and one thing at <lb/>
a time and each thing in its own proper turn; so I <lb/>
passed by the bank and branched off and started for <lb/>
the two lacking members of the Expedition. A cab <lb/>
lazied by, and I took it upon persuasion. I gained no <lb/>
speed by this, but it was a reposeful turnout and I like <lb/>
reposefulness. The week-long jubilations over the six <lb/>
hundredth anniversary of the birth of Swiss liberty and <lb/>
the Signing of the Compact was at flood tide, and all <lb/>
the streets were clothed in fluttering flags.</p>
<p>The horse and the driver had been drunk three days <lb/>
and nights, and had known no stall nor bed meantime. <lb/>
They looked as I felt&#x2014;dreamy and seedy. But we <lb/>
arrived in course of time. I went in and rang, and <lb/>
asked a housemaid to rush out the lacking members. <lb/>
She said something which I did not understand, and I <lb/>
returned to the chariot. The girl had probably told <lb/>
me that those people did not belong on her floor, and <lb/>
that it would be judicious for me to go higher, and ring <lb/>
from floor to floor till I found them; for in those <lb/>
Swiss flats there does not seem to be any way to find <lb/>
the right family but to be patient and guess your way <lb/>
along up. I calculated that I must wait fifteen min- <lb/>
utes, there being three details inseparable from an <lb/>
occasion of this sort: 1, put on hats and come down <lb/>
and climb in; 2, return of one to get "my other <lb/>
glove;" 3, presently, return of the other one to fetch <lb/>
<pb n="495"/>
"my <i>French Verbs at a Glance</i>." I would muse dur- <lb/>
ing the fifteen minutes and take it easy.</p>
<p>A very still and blank interval ensued, and then I <lb/>
felt a hand on my shoulder and started. The intruder <lb/>
was a policeman. I glanced up and perceived that <lb/>
there was new scenery. There was a good deal of a <lb/>
crowd, and they had that pleased and interested look <lb/>
which such a crowd wears when they see that some- <lb/>
body is out of luck. The horse was asleep, and so <lb/>
was the driver, and some boys had hung them and me <lb/>
full of gaudy decorations stolen from the innumerable <lb/>
banner poles. It was a scandalous spectacle. The <lb/>
officer said:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but we can't have you sleeping here all <lb/>
day."</p>
<p>I was wounded and said with dignity:</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, I was not sleeping; I was <lb/>
thinking."</p>
<p>"Well, you can think if you want to, but you've <lb/>
got to think to yourself; you disturb the whole neigh- <lb/>
borhood."</p>
<p>It was a poor joke, and it made the crowd laugh. I <lb/>
snore at night sometimes, but it is not likely that I <lb/>
would do such a thing in the daytime and in such a <lb/>
place. The officer undecorated us, and seemed sorry <lb/>
for our friendlessness, and really tried to be humane, <lb/>
but he said we mustn't stop there any longer or he <lb/>
would have to charge us rent&#x2014;it was the law, he said, <lb/>
and he went on to say in a sociable way that I was <lb/>
looking pretty mouldy, and he wished he knew&#x2014;</p>
<p>I shut him off pretty austerely, and said I hoped one <lb/>
might celebrate a little these days, especially when one <lb/>
was personally concerned.</p>
<p>"Personally?" he asked. How?"</p>
<p>"Because 600 years ago an ancestor of mine signed <lb/>
the compact."</p>
<pb n="496"/>
<p>He reflected a moment, then looked me over and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Ancestor! It's my opinion you signed it your- <lb/>
self. For of all the old ancient relics that ever I&#x2014;but <lb/>
never mind about that. What is it you are waiting <lb/>
here for so long?"</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"I'm not waiting here so long at all. I'm waiting <lb/>
fifteen minutes till they forget a glove and a book and <lb/>
go back and get them." Then I told him who they <lb/>
were that I had come for.</p>
<p>He was very obliging, and began to shout inquiries <lb/>
to the tiers of heads and shoulders projecting from the <lb/>
windows above us. Then a woman away up there sang <lb/>
out:</p>
<p>"Oh, they? Why I got them a cab and they left <lb/>
here long ago&#x2014;half-past eight, I should say."</p>
<p>It was annoying. I glanced at my watch, but didn't <lb/>
say anything. The officer said:</p>
<p>"It is a quarter of twelve, you see. You should <lb/>
have inquired better. You have been asleep three- <lb/>
quarters of an hour, and in such a sun as this. You <lb/>
are baked&#x2014;baked black. It is wonderful. And you <lb/>
will miss your train, perhaps. You interest me greatly. <lb/>
What is your occupation?"</p>
<p>I said I was a courier. It seemed to stun him, and <lb/>
before he could come to we were gone.</p>
<p>When I arrived in the third story of the hotel I found <lb/>
our quarters vacant. I was not surprised. The mo- <lb/>
ment a courier takes his eye off his tribe they go shop- <lb/>
ping. The nearer it is to train time the surer they are <lb/>
to go. I sat down to try and think out what I had <lb/>
best do next, but presently the hall boy found me <lb/>
there, and said the Expedition had gone to the station <lb/>
half an hour before. It was the first time I had known <lb/>
them to do a rational thing, and it was very confusing. <lb/>
<pb n="497"/>
This is one of the things that make a courier's life so <lb/>
difficult and uncertain. Just as matters are going the <lb/>
smoothest, his people will strike a lucid interval, and <lb/>
down go all his arrangements to wreck and ruin.</p>
<p>The train was to leave at twelve noon sharp. It <lb/>
was now ten minutes after twelve. I could be at the <lb/>
station in ten minutes. I saw I had no great amount <lb/>
of leeway, for this was the lightning express, and on <lb/>
the Continent the lightning expresses are pretty fastidi- <lb/>
ous about getting away some time during the advertised <lb/>
day. My people were the only ones remaining in the <lb/>
waiting-room; everybody else had passed through and <lb/>
"mounted the train," as they say in those regions. <lb/>
They were exhausted with nervousness and fret, but I <lb/>
comforted them and heartened them up, and we made <lb/>
our rush.</p>
<p>But no; we were out of luck again. The door- <lb/>
keeper was not satisfied with the tickets. He examined <lb/>
them cautiously, deliberately, suspiciously; then glared <lb/>
at me a while, and after that he called another official. <lb/>
The two examined the tickets and called another offi- <lb/>
cial. These called others, and the convention discussed <lb/>
and discussed, and gesticulated and carried on, until I <lb/>
begged that they would consider how time was flying, <lb/>
and just pass a few resolutions and let us go. Then <lb/>
they said very courteously that there was a defect in <lb/>
the tickets, and asked me where I got them.</p>
<p>I judged I saw what the trouble was now. You see, <lb/>
I had bought the tickets in a cigar shop, and, of <lb/>
course, the tobacco smell was on them; without doubt, <lb/>
the thing they were up to was to work the tickets <lb/>
through the Custom House and to collect duty on that <lb/>
smell. So I resolved to be perfectly frank; it is some- <lb/>
times the best way. I said:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I will not deceive you. These railway <lb/>
tickets&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="498"/>
<p>"Ah, pardon, monsieur! These are not railway <lb/>
tickets."</p>
<p>"Oh," I said, "is that the defect?"</p>
<p>"Ah, truly yes, monsieur. These are lottery tickets, <lb/>
yes; and it is a lottery which has been drawn two years <lb/>
ago."</p>
<p>I affected to be greatly amused; it is all one can do <lb/>
in such circumstances; it is all one can do, and yet <lb/>
there is no value in it; it deceives nobody, and you <lb/>
can see that everybody around pities you and is <lb/>
ashamed of you. One of the hardest situations in life, <lb/>
I think, is to be full of grief and a sense of defeat and <lb/>
shabbiness that way, and yet have to put on an outside <lb/>
of archness and gayety, while all the time you know <lb/>
that your own Expedition, the treasures of your heart, <lb/>
and whose love and reverence you are by the custom <lb/>
of our civilization entitled to, are being consumed with <lb/>
humiliation before strangers to see you earning and <lb/>
getting a compassion which is a stigma, a brand&#x2014;a <lb/>
brand which certifies you to be&#x2014;oh, anything and <lb/>
everything which is fatal to human respect.</p>
<p>I said, cheerily, it was all right, just one of those <lb/>
little accidents that was likely to happen to anybody&#x2014; <lb/>
I would have the right tickets in two minutes, and we <lb/>
would catch the train yet, and, moreover, have some- <lb/>
thing to laugh about all through the journey. I did <lb/>
get the tickets in time, all stamped and complete, but <lb/>
then it turned out that I couldn't take them, because <lb/>
in taking so much pains about the two missing mem- <lb/>
bers, I had skipped the bank and hadn't the money. <lb/>
So then the train left, and there didn't seem to be any- <lb/>
thing to do but go back to the hotel, which we did; <lb/>
but it was kind of melancholy and not much said. I <lb/>
tried to start a few subjects, like scenery and transub- <lb/>
stantiation, and those sorts of things, but they didn't <lb/>
seem to hit the weather right.</p>
<pb n="499"/>
<p>We had lost our good rooms, but we got some <lb/>
others which were pretty scattering, but would answer. <lb/>
I judged things would brighten now, but the Head of <lb/>
the Expedition said, "Send up the trunks." It made <lb/>
me feel pretty cold. There was a doubtful something <lb/>
about that trunk business. I was almost sure of it. I <lb/>
was going to suggest&#x2014;</p>
<p>But a wave of the hand sufficiently restrained me, <lb/>
and I was informed that we would now camp for three <lb/>
days and see if we could rest up.</p>
<p>I said all right, never mind ringing; I would go <lb/>
down and attend to the trunks myself. I got a cab <lb/>
and went straight to Mr. Charles Natural's place, and <lb/>
asked what order it was I had left there.</p>
<p>"To send seven trunks to the hotel."</p>
<p>"And were you to bring any back?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You are sure I didn't tell you to bring back seven <lb/>
that would be found piled in the lobby?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely sure you didn't."</p>
<p>"Then the whole fourteen are gone to Zurich or <lb/>
Jericho or somewhere, and there is going to be more <lb/>
d&#x00E9;bris around that hotel when the Expedition&#x2014;"</p>
<p>I didn't finish, because my mind was getting to be in <lb/>
a good deal of a whirl, and when you are that way you <lb/>
think you have finished a sentence when you haven't, <lb/>
and you go mooning and dreaming away, and the first <lb/>
thing you know you get run over by a dray or a cow or <lb/>
something.</p>
<p>I left the cab there&#x2014;I forgot it&#x2014;and on my way <lb/>
back I thought it all out and concluded to resign, be- <lb/>
cause otherwise I should be nearly sure to be dis- <lb/>
charged. But I didn't believe it would be a good idea <lb/>
to resign in person; I could do it by message. So I <lb/>
sent for Mr. Ludi and explained that there was a <lb/>
courier going to resign on account of incompatibility <lb/>
<pb n="500"/>
or fatigue or something, and as he had four or five <lb/>
vacant days, I would like to insert him into that <lb/>
vacancy if he thought he could fill it. When every- <lb/>
thing was arranged I got him to go up and say to the <lb/>
Expedition that, owing to an error made by Mr. <lb/>
Natural's people, we were out of trunks here, but <lb/>
would have plent in Zurich, and we'd better take the <lb/>
first train, freight, gravel, or construction, and move <lb/>
right along.</p>
<p>He attended to that and came down with an invita- <lb/>
tion for me to go up&#x2014;yes, certainly; and, while we <lb/>
walked along over to the bank to get money, and col- <lb/>
lect my cigars and tobacco, and to the cigar shop to <lb/>
trade back the lottery tickets and get my umbrella, and <lb/>
to Mr. Natural's to pay that cab and send it away, and <lb/>
to the county jail to get my rubbers and leave p. p. c. <lb/>
cards for the Mayor and Supreme Court, he described <lb/>
the weather to me that was prevailing on the upper <lb/>
levels there with the Expedition, and I saw that I was <lb/>
doing very well where I was.</p>
<p>I stayed out in the woods till four <smcap>p. m.</smcap>, to let the <lb/>
weather moderate, and then turned up at the station <lb/>
just in time to take the three o'clock express for Zurich <lb/>
along with the Expedition, now in the hands of Ludi, <lb/>
who conducted its complex affairs with little apparent <lb/>
effort or inconvenience.</p>
<p>Well, I had worked like a slave while I was in office, <lb/>
and done the very best I knew how; yet all that these <lb/>
people dwelt upon or seemed to care to remember was <lb/>
the defects of my administration, not its creditable <lb/>
features. They would skip over a thousand creditable <lb/>
features to remark upon and reiterate and fuss about <lb/>
just one fact, till it seemed to me they would wear it <lb/>
out; and not much of a fact, either, taken by itself&#x2014; <lb/>
the fact that I elected myself courier in Geneva, and <lb/>
put in work enough to carry a circus to Jerusalem, and <lb/>
<pb n="501"/>
yet never even got my gang out of the town. I finally <lb/>
said I didn't wish to hear any more about the subject, <lb/>
it made me tired. And I told them to their faces that <lb/>
I would never be a courier again to save anybody's <lb/>
life. And if I live long enough I'll prove it. I think <lb/>
it's a difficult, brain-racking, overworked, and thor- <lb/>
oughly ungrateful office, and the main bulk of its <lb/>
wages is a sore heart and a bruised spirit.</p>

<pb n="502"/>
<head><b>THE GERMAN CHICAGO</b></head>
<p><smcap>I feel</smcap> lost in Berlin. It has no resemblance to the <lb/>
city I had supposed it was. There was once a <lb/>
Berlin which I would have known, from descriptions in <lb/>
books&#x2014;the Berlin of the last century and the begin- <lb/>
ning of the present one: a dingy city in a marsh, with <lb/>
rough streets, muddy and lantern-lighted, dividing <lb/>
straight rows of ugly houses all alike, compacted into <lb/>
blocks as square and plain and uniform and monotonous <lb/>
and serious as so many dry-goods boxes. But that <lb/>
Berlin has disappeared. It seems to have disappeared <lb/>
totally, and left no sign. The bulk of the Berlin of <lb/>
to-day has about it no suggestion of a former period. <lb/>
The site it stands on has traditions and a history, but <lb/>
the city itself has no traditions and no history. It is a <lb/>
new city; the newest I have ever seen. Chicago would <lb/>
seem venerable beside it; for there are many old- <lb/>
looking districts in Chicago, but not many in Berlin. <lb/>
The main mass of the city looks as if it had been built <lb/>
last week, the rest of it has a just perceptibly graver <lb/>
tone, and looks as if it might be six or even eight <lb/>
months old.</p>
<p>The next feature that strikes one is the spaciousness, <lb/>
the roominess of the city. There is no other city, in <lb/>
any country, whose streets are so generally wide. <lb/>
Berlin is not merely <i>a</i> city of wide streets, it is <i>the</i> city <lb/>
of wide streets. As a wide street city it has never had <lb/>
its equal, in any age of the world. "Unter den <lb/>
<pb n="503"/>
Linden" is three streets in one; the Potsdamerstrasse <lb/>
is bordered on both sides by sidewalks which are them- <lb/>
selves wider than some of the historic thoroughfares of <lb/>
the old European capitals; there seem to be no lanes <lb/>
or alleys; there are no short cuts; here and there, <lb/>
where several important streets empty into a common <lb/>
center, that center's circumference is of a magnitude <lb/>
calculated to bring that word spaciousness into your <lb/>
mind again. The park in the middle of the city is so <lb/>
huge that it calls up that expression once more.</p>
<p>The next feature that strikes one is the straightness <lb/>
of the streets. The short ones haven't so much as a <lb/>
waver in them; the long ones stretch out to prodigious <lb/>
distances and then tilt a little to the right or left, then <lb/>
stretch out on another immense reach as straight as a <lb/>
ray of light. A result of this arrangement is, that at <lb/>
night Berlin is an inspiring sight to see. Gas and the <lb/>
electric light are employed with a wasteful liberality, <lb/>
and so, wherever one goes, he has always double ranks <lb/>
of brilliant lights stretching far down into the night on <lb/>
every hand, with here and there a wide and splendid <lb/>
constellation of them spread out over an intervening <lb/>
"Platz"; and between the interminable double pro- <lb/>
cession of street lamps one has the swarming and dart- <lb/>
ing cab lamps, a lively and pretty addition to the fine <lb/>
spectacle, for they counterfeit the rush and confusion <lb/>
and sparkle of an invasion of fire-flies.</p>
<p>There is one other noticeable feature&#x2014;the absolutely <lb/>
level surface of the site of Berlin. Berlin&#x2014;to capitu- <lb/>
late&#x2014;is newer to the eye than is any other city, and <lb/>
also blonder of complexion and tidier; no other city <lb/>
has such an air of roominess, freedom from crowding; <lb/>
no other city has so many straight streets; and with <lb/>
Chicago it contests the chromo for flatness of surface <lb/>
and for phenomenal swiftness of growth. Berlin is the <lb/>
European Chicago. The two cities have about the <lb/>
<pb n="504"/>
same population&#x2014;say a million and a half. I cannot <lb/>
speak in exact terms, because I only know what <lb/>
Chicago's population was week before last; but at <lb/>
that time it was about a million and a half. Fifteen <lb/>
years ago Berlin and Chicago were large cities, of <lb/>
course, but neither of them was the giant it now is.</p>
<p>But now the parallels fail. Only parts of Chicago <lb/>
are stately and beautiful, whereas all of Berlin is stately <lb/>
and substantial, and it is not merely in parts but uni- <lb/>
formly beautiful. There are buildings in Chicago that <lb/>
are architecturally finer than any in Berlin, I think, but <lb/>
what I have just said above is still true. These two <lb/>
flat cities would lead the world for phenomenal good <lb/>
health if London were out of the way. As it is, Lon- <lb/>
don leads by a point or two. Berlin's death rate is <lb/>
only nineteen in the thousand. Fourteen years ago the <lb/>
rate was a third higher.</p>
<p>Berlin is a surprise in a great many ways&#x2014;in a <lb/>
multitude of ways, to speak strongly and be exact. It <lb/>
seems to be the most governed city in the world, but <lb/>
one must admit that it also seems to be the best <lb/>
governed. Method and system are observable on every <lb/>
hand&#x2014;in great things, in little things, in all details, <lb/>
of whatsoever size. And it is not method and system <lb/>
on paper, and there an end&#x2014;it is method and system <lb/>
in practice. It has a rule for everything, and puts the <lb/>
rule in force; puts it in force against the poor and <lb/>
powerful alike, without favor or prejudice. It deals <lb/>
with great matters and minute particulars with equal <lb/>
faithfulness, and with a plodding and painstaking dili- <lb/>
gence and persistency which compel admiration&#x2014;and <lb/>
sometimes regret. There are several taxes, and they <lb/>
are collected quarterly. Collected is the word; they <lb/>
are not merely levied, they are collected&#x2014;every time. <lb/>
This makes light taxes. It is in cities and countries <lb/>
where a considerable part of the community shirk pay- <lb/>
<pb n="505"/>
ment that taxes have to be lifted to a burdensome <lb/>
rate. Here the police keep coming, calmly and <lb/>
patiently, until you pay your tax. They charge you <lb/>
five or ten cents per visit after the first call. By ex- <lb/>
periment you will find that they will presently collect <lb/>
that money.</p>
<p>In one respect the million and a half of Berlin's <lb/>
population are like a family: the head of this large <lb/>
family knows the names of its several members, and <lb/>
where the said members are located, and when and <lb/>
where they were born, and what they do for a living, <lb/>
and what their religious brand is. Whoever comes to <lb/>
Berlin must furnish these particulars to the police im- <lb/>
mediately; moreover, if he knows how long he is <lb/>
going to stay, he must say so. If he take a house he <lb/>
will be taxed on the rent and taxed also on his income. <lb/>
He will not be asked what his income is, and so he <lb/>
may save some lies for home consumption. The <lb/>
police will estimate his income from the house-rent he <lb/>
pays, and tax him on that basis.</p>
<p>Duties on imported articles are collected with <lb/>
inflexible fidelity, be the sum large or little; but the <lb/>
methods are gentle, prompt, and full of the spirit of <lb/>
accommodation. The postman attends to the whole <lb/>
matter for you, in cases where the article comes by <lb/>
mail, and you have no trouble and suffer no inconveni- <lb/>
ence. The other day a friend of mine was informed <lb/>
that there was a package in the post-office for him, <lb/>
containing a lady's silk belt with gold clasp, and a <lb/>
gold chain to hang a bunch of keys on. In his first <lb/>
agitation he was going to try to bribe the postman to <lb/>
chalk it through, but acted upon his sober second <lb/>
thought and allowed the matter to take its proper and <lb/>
regular course. In a little while the postman brought <lb/>
the package and made these several collections: duty <lb/>
on the silk belt, 7&#x00BD; cents; duty on the gold chain, 10 <lb/>
<pb n="506"/>
cents; charge for fetching the package, 5 cents. These <lb/>
devastating imposts are exacted for the protection of <lb/>
German home industries.</p>
<p>The calm, quiet, courteous, cussed persistence of <lb/>
the police is the most admirable thing I have en- <lb/>
countered on this side. They undertook to persuade <lb/>
me to send and get a passport for a Swiss maid whom <lb/>
we had brought with us, and at the end of six weeks of <lb/>
patient, tranquil, angelic daily effort they succeeded. <lb/>
I was not intending to give them trouble, but I was <lb/>
lazy and I thought they would get tired. Meanwhile <lb/>
they probably thought I would be the one. It turned <lb/>
out just so.</p>
<p>One is not allowed to build unstable, unsafe, or un- <lb/>
sightly houses in Berlin; the result is this comely and <lb/>
conspicuously stately city, with its security from con- <lb/>
flagrations and breakdowns. It is built of architectural <lb/>
Gibraltars. The building commissioners inspect while <lb/>
the building is going up. It has been found that this <lb/>
is better than to wait till it falls down. These people <lb/>
are full of whims.</p>
<p>One is not allowed to cram poor folk into cramped <lb/>
and dirty tenement houses. Each individual must have <lb/>
just so many cubic feet of room-space, and sanitary <lb/>
inspections are systematic and frequent.</p>
<p>Everything is orderly. The fire brigade march in <lb/>
rank, curiously uniformed, and so grave is their de- <lb/>
meanor that they look like a Salvation Army under <lb/>
conviction of sin. People tell me that when a fire <lb/>
alarm is sounded, the firemen assemble calmly, answer <lb/>
to their names when the roll is called, then proceed to <lb/>
the fire. There they are ranked up, military fashion, <lb/>
and told off in detachments by the chief, who parcels <lb/>
out to the detachments the several parts of the work <lb/>
which they are to undertake in putting out that fire. <lb/>
This is all done with low-voiced propriety, and strangers <lb/>
<pb n="507"/>
think these people are working a funeral. As a rule, <lb/>
the fire is confined to a single floor in these great <lb/>
masses of bricks and masonry, and consequently there <lb/>
is little or no interest attaching to a fire here for the <lb/>
rest of the occupants of the house.</p>
<p>There is abundance of newspapers in Berlin, and <lb/>
there was also a newsboy, but he died. At intervals <lb/>
of half a mile on the thoroughfares there are booths, <lb/>
and it is at these that you buy your papers. There <lb/>
are plenty of theaters, but they do not advertise in a <lb/>
loud way. There are no big posters of any kind, and <lb/>
the display of vast type and of pictures of actors and <lb/>
performance framed on a big scale and done in rain- <lb/>
bow colors is a thing unknown. If the big show-bills <lb/>
existed there would be no place to exhibit them; for <lb/>
there are no poster-fences, and one would not be <lb/>
allowed to disfigure dead walls with them. Unsightly <lb/>
things are forbidden here; Berlin is a rest to the eye.</p>
<p>And yet the saunterer can easily find out what is <lb/>
going on at the theaters. All over the city, at short <lb/>
distances apart, there are neat round pillars eighteen <lb/>
feet high and about as thick as a hogshead, and on <lb/>
these the little black and white theater bills and other <lb/>
notices are posted. One generally finds a group around <lb/>
each pillar reading these things. There are plenty of <lb/>
things in Berlin worth importing to America. It is <lb/>
these that I have particularly wished to make a note of. <lb/>
When Buffalo Bill was here his biggest poster was <lb/>
probably not larger than the top of an ordinary trunk.</p>
<p>There is a multiplicity of clean and comfortable <lb/>
horse-cars, but whenever you think you know where a <lb/>
car is going to you would better stop ashore, because <lb/>
that car is not going to that place at all. The car <lb/>
routes are marvelously intricate, and often the drivers <lb/>
get lost and are not heard of for years. The signs on <lb/>
the cars furnish no details as to the course of the <lb/>
<pb n="508"/>
journey; they name the end of it, and then experi- <lb/>
ment around to see how much territory they can cover <lb/>
before they get there. The conductor will collect your <lb/>
fare over again every few miles, and give you a ticket <lb/>
which he hasn't apparently kept any record of, and <lb/>
you keep it till an inspector comes aboard by and by <lb/>
and tears a corner off it (which he does not keep), <lb/>
then you throw the ticket away and get ready to buy <lb/>
another. Brains are of no value when you are trying <lb/>
to navigate Berlin in a horse-car. When the ablest of <lb/>
Brooklyn's editors was here on a visit he took a horse- <lb/>
car in the early morning, and wore it out trying to go <lb/>
to a point in the center of the city. He was on board <lb/>
all day and spent many dollars in fares, and then did <lb/>
not arrive at the place which he had started to go to. <lb/>
This is the most thorough way to see Berlin, but it is <lb/>
also the most expensive.</p>
<p>But there are excellent features about the car system, <lb/>
nevertheless. The car will not stop for you to get on <lb/>
or off, except at certain places a block or two apart <lb/>
where there is a sign to indicate that that is a halting <lb/>
station. This system saves many bones. There are <lb/>
twenty places inside the car; when these seats are filled, <lb/>
no more can enter. Four or five persons may stand on <lb/>
each platform&#x2014;the law decrees the number&#x2014;and <lb/>
when these standing places are all occupied the next <lb/>
applicant is refused. As there is no crowding, and as <lb/>
no rowdyism is allowed, women stand on the platforms <lb/>
as well as the men; they often stand there when there <lb/>
are vacant seats inside, for these places are comfort- <lb/>
able, there being little or no jolting. A native tells me <lb/>
that when the first car was put on, thirty or forty years <lb/>
ago, the public had such a terror of it that they didn't <lb/>
feel safe inside of it or outside, either. They made the <lb/>
company keep a man at every crossing with a red flag <lb/>
in his hand. Nobody would travel in the car except <lb/>
<pb n="509"/>
convicts on the way to the gallows. This made busi- <lb/>
ness in only one direction, and the car had to go back <lb/>
light. To save the company, the city government <lb/>
transferred the convict cemetery to the other end of <lb/>
the line. This made traffic in both directions and kept <lb/>
the company from going under. This sounds like <lb/>
some of the information which traveling foreigners are <lb/>
furnished with in America. To my mind it has a <lb/>
doubtful ring about it.</p>
<p>The first-class cab is neat and trim, and has leather- <lb/>
cushion seats and a swift horse. The second-class cab <lb/>
is an ugly and lubberly vehicle, and is always old. It <lb/>
seems a strange thing that they have never built any <lb/>
new ones. Still, if such a thing were done everybody <lb/>
that had time to flock would flock to see it, and that <lb/>
would make a crowd, and the police do not like crowds <lb/>
and disorder here. If there were an earthquake in <lb/>
Berlin the police would take charge of it and conduct it <lb/>
in that sort of orderly way that would make you think <lb/>
it was a prayer-meeting. That is what an earthquake <lb/>
generally ends in, but this one would be different from <lb/>
those others; it would be kind of soft and self- <lb/>
contained, like a republican praying for a mugwump.</p>
<p>For a course (a quarter of an hour or less), one <lb/>
pays twenty-five cents in a first-class cab, and fifteen <lb/>
cents in a second-class. The first-class will take you <lb/>
along faster, for the second-class horse is old&#x2014;always <lb/>
old&#x2014;as old as his cab, some authorities say&#x2014;and <lb/>
ill-fed and weak. He has been a first-class once, but <lb/>
has been degraded to second-class for long and faithful <lb/>
service.</p>
<p>Still, he must take you as <i>far</i> for fifteen cents as the <lb/>
other horse takes you for twenty-five. If he can't do <lb/>
his fifteen-minute distance in fifteen minutes, he must <lb/>
still do the distance for the fifteen cents. Any stranger <lb/>
can check the distance off&#x2014;by means of the most <lb/>
<pb n="510"/>
curious map I am acquainted with. It is issued by <lb/>
the city government and can be bought in any shop <lb/>
for a trifle. In it every street is sectioned off like a <lb/>
string of long beads of different colors. Each long <lb/>
bead represents a minute's travel, and when you have <lb/>
covered fifteen of the beads you have got your money's <lb/>
worth. This map of Berlin is a gay-colored maze, and <lb/>
looks like pictures of the circulation of the blood.</p>
<p>The streets are very clean. They are kept so&#x2014;not <lb/>
by prayer and talk and the other New York methods, <lb/>
but by daily and hourly work with scrapers and <lb/>
brooms; and when an asphalted street has been tidily <lb/>
scraped after a rain or a light snowfall, they scatter <lb/>
clean sand over it. This saves some of the horses from <lb/>
falling down. In fact, this is a city government which <lb/>
seems to stop at no expense where the public conveni- <lb/>
ence, comfort, and health are concerned&#x2014;except in <lb/>
one detail. That is the naming of the streets and the <lb/>
numbering of the houses. Sometimes the name of a <lb/>
street will change in the middle of a block. You will <lb/>
not find it out till you get to the next corner and dis- <lb/>
cover the new name on the wall, and, of course, you <lb/>
don't know just when the change happened.</p>
<p>The names are plainly marked on the corners&#x2014;on <lb/>
all the corners&#x2014;there are no exceptions. But the <lb/>
numbering of the houses&#x2014;there has never been any- <lb/>
thing like it since original chaos. It is not possible <lb/>
that it was done by this wise city government. At first <lb/>
one thinks it was done by an idiot; but there is too <lb/>
much variety about it for that; an idiot could not <lb/>
think of so many different ways of making confusion <lb/>
and propagating blasphemy. The numbers run up <lb/>
one side the street and down the other. That is en- <lb/>
durable, but the rest isn't. They often use one number <lb/>
for three or four houses&#x2014;and sometimes they put the <lb/>
number on only one of the houses and let you guess at <lb/>
<pb n="511"/>
the others. Sometimes they put a number on a house <lb/>
&#x2014;4, for instance&#x2014;then put 4<i>a</i>, 4<i>b</i>, 4<i>c</i>, on the suc- <lb/>
ceeding houses, and one becomes old and decrepit <lb/>
before he finally arrives at 5. A result of this system- <lb/>
less system is that when you are at No. 1 in a street <lb/>
you haven't any idea how far it may be to No. 150; it <lb/>
may be only six or eight blocks, it may be a couple of <lb/>
miles. Frederick street is long, and is one of the great <lb/>
thoroughfares. The other day a man put up his money <lb/>
behind the assertion that there were more refreshment <lb/>
places in that street than numbers on the houses&#x2014;and <lb/>
he won. There were 254 numbers and 257 refresh- <lb/>
ment places. Yet as I have said, it is a long street.</p>
<p>But the worst feature of all this complex business is <lb/>
that in Berlin the numbers do not travel in any one <lb/>
direction; no, they travel along until they get to 50 or <lb/>
60, perhaps, then suddenly you find yourself up in the <lb/>
hundreds&#x2014;140, maybe; the next will be 139&#x2014;then <lb/>
you perceive by that sign that the numbers are now <lb/>
traveling towards you from the opposite direction. <lb/>
They will keep that sort of insanity up as long as you <lb/>
travel that street; every now and then the numbers will <lb/>
turn and run the other way. As a rule, there is an <lb/>
arrow under the number, to show by the direction of <lb/>
its flight which way the numbers are proceeding. <lb/>
There are a good many suicides in Berlin; I have seen <lb/>
six reported in a single day. There is always a deal of <lb/>
learned and laborious arguing and ciphering going on <lb/>
as to the cause of this state of things. If they will set <lb/>
to work and number their houses in a rational way per- <lb/>
haps they will find out what was the matter.</p>
<p>More than a month ago Berlin began to prepare <lb/>
to celebrate Professor Virchow's seventieth birthday. <lb/>
When the birthday arrived, the middle of October, it <lb/>
seemed to me that all the world of science arrived with <lb/>
it; deputation after deputation came, bringing the <lb/>
<pb n="512"/>
homage and reverence of far cities and centers of learn- <lb/>
ing, and during the whole of a long day the hero of it <lb/>
sat and received such witness of his greatness as has <lb/>
seldom been vouchsafed to any man in any walk of life <lb/>
in any time, ancient or modern. These demonstrations <lb/>
were continued in one form or another day after day, <lb/>
and were presently merged in similar demonstrations to <lb/>
his twin in science and achievement, Professor Helm- <lb/>
holtz, whose seventieth birthday is separated from <lb/>
Virchow's by only about three weeks; so nearly as <lb/>
this did these two extraordinary men come to being <lb/>
born together. Two such births have seldom signalized <lb/>
a single year in human history.</p>
<p>But perhaps the final and closing demonstration was <lb/>
peculiarly grateful to them. This was a Commers <lb/>
given in their honor the other night by 1,000 students. <lb/>
It was held in a huge hall, very long and very lofty, <lb/>
which had five galleries, far above everybody's head, <lb/>
which were crowded with ladies&#x2014;four or five hundred, <lb/>
I judged.</p>
<p>It was beautifully decorated with clustered flags and <lb/>
various ornamental devices, and was brilliantly lighted. <lb/>
On the spacious floor of this place were ranged, in <lb/>
files, innumerable tables, seating twenty-four persons <lb/>
each, extending from one end of the great hall clear to <lb/>
the other, and with narrow aisles between the files. In <lb/>
the center on one side was a high and tastefully <lb/>
decorated platform twenty or thirty feet long, with a <lb/>
long table on it behind which sat the half-dozen chiefs <lb/>
of the givers of the Commers in the rich medi&#x00E6;val cos- <lb/>
tumes of as many different college corps. Behind these <lb/>
youths a band of musicians was concealed. On the <lb/>
floor directly in front of this platform were half a <lb/>
dozen tables which were distinguished from the out- <lb/>
lying continent of tables by being covered instead of <lb/>
left naked. Of these the central table was reserved for <lb/>
<pb n="513"/>
the two heroes of the occasion and twenty particularly <lb/>
eminent professors of the Berlin University, and the <lb/>
other covered tables were for the occupancy of a hun- <lb/>
dred less distinguished professors.</p>
<p>"I was glad to be honored with a place at the table <lb/>
of the two heroes of the occasion, although I was not <lb/>
really learned enough to deserve it. Indeed, there was <lb/>
a pleasant strangeness in being in such company; to <lb/>
be thus associated with twenty-three men who forget <lb/>
more every day than I ever knew. Yet there was <lb/>
nothing embarrassing about it, because loaded men and <lb/>
empty ones look about alike, and I knew that to that <lb/>
multitude there I was a professor. It required but <lb/>
little art to catch the ways and attitude of those men <lb/>
and imitate them, and I had no difficulty in looking as <lb/>
much like a professor as anybody there.</p>
<p>We arrived early; so early that only Professors <lb/>
Virchow and Helmholtz and a dozen guests of the <lb/>
special tables were ahead of us, and 300 or 400 students. <lb/>
But people were arriving in floods now, and within <lb/>
fifteen minutes all but the special tables were occupied, <lb/>
and the great house was crammed, the aisles included. <lb/>
It was said that there were 4,000 men present. It was <lb/>
a most animated scene, there is no doubt about that; <lb/>
it was a stupendous beehive. At each end of each <lb/>
table stood a corps student in the uniform of his corps. <lb/>
These quaint costumes are of brilliant colored silks and <lb/>
velvets, with sometimes a high plumed hat, sometimes <lb/>
a broad Scotch cap, with a great plume wound about <lb/>
it, sometimes&#x2014;oftenest&#x2014;a little shallow silk cap on <lb/>
the tip of the crown, like an inverted saucer; some- <lb/>
times the pantaloons are snow-white, sometimes of <lb/>
other colors; the boots in all cases come up well above <lb/>
the knee; and in all cases also white gauntlets are <lb/>
worn; the sword is a rapier with a bowl-shaped guard <lb/>
for the hand, painted in several colors. Each corps <lb/>
<pb n="514"/>
has a uniform of its own, and all are of rich material, <lb/>
brilliant in color, and exceedingly picturesque; for <lb/>
they are survivals of the vanished costumes of the <lb/>
Middle Ages, and they reproduce for us the time when <lb/>
men were beautiful to look at. The student who stood <lb/>
guard at our end of the table was of grave countenance <lb/>
and great frame and grace of form, and he was doubt- <lb/>
less an accurate reproduction, clothes and all, of some <lb/>
ancestor of his of two or three centuries ago&#x2014;a <lb/>
reproduction as far as the outside, the animal man, <lb/>
goes, I mean.</p>
<p>As I say, the place was now crowded. The nearest <lb/>
aisle was packed with students standing up, and they <lb/>
made a fence which shut off the rest of the house from <lb/>
view. As far down this fence as you could see all <lb/>
these wholesome young faces were turned in one direc- <lb/>
tion, all these intent and worshiping eyes were centered <lb/>
upon one spot&#x2014;the place where Virchow and Helm- <lb/>
holtz sat. The boys seemed lost to everything, uncon- <lb/>
scious of their own existence; they devoured these two <lb/>
intellectual giants with their eyes, they feasted upon <lb/>
them, and the worship that was in their hearts shone <lb/>
in their faces. It seemed to me that I would rather be <lb/>
flooded with a glory like that, instinct with sincerity, <lb/>
innocent of self-seeking, than win a hundred battles <lb/>
and break a million hearts.</p>
<p>There was a big mug of beer in front of each of us, <lb/>
and more to come when wanted. There was also a <lb/>
quarto pamphlet containing the words of the songs to <lb/>
be sung. After the names of the officers of the feast <lb/>
were these words in large type:</p>
<p><foreign lang="ger"><i>"W&#x00E4;hrend des Kommerses herrscht allgemeiner <lb/>
Burgfriede."</i></foreign></p>
<p>I was not able to translate this to my satisfaction, <lb/>
but a professor helped me out. This was his explana- <lb/>
<pb n="515"/>
tion: The students in uniform belong to different col- <lb/>
lege corps; not all students belong to corps; none <lb/>
join the corps except those who enjoy fighting. The <lb/>
corps students fight duels with swords every week, one <lb/>
corps challenging another corps to furnish a certain <lb/>
number of duelists for the occasion, and it is only on <lb/>
this battlefield that students of different corps ex- <lb/>
change courtesies. In common life they do not drink <lb/>
with each other or speak. The above line now trans- <lb/>
lates itself: there is truce during the Commers, war is <lb/>
laid aside and fellowship takes its place.</p>
<p>Now the performance began. The concealed band <lb/>
played a piece of martial music; then there was a <lb/>
pause. The students on the platform rose to their <lb/>
feet, the middle one gave a toast to the Emperor, then <lb/>
all the house rose, mugs in hand. At the call "One&#x2014; <lb/>
two&#x2014;three!" all glasses were drained and then <lb/>
brought down with a slam on the tables in unison. <lb/>
The result was as good an imitation of thunder as I <lb/>
have ever heard. From now on, during an hour, there <lb/>
was singing, in mighty chorus. During each interval <lb/>
between songs a number of the special guests&#x2014;the <lb/>
professors&#x2014;arrived. There seemed to be some signal <lb/>
whereby the students on the platform were made aware <lb/>
that a professor had arrived at the remote door of <lb/>
entrance; for you would see them suddenly rise to <lb/>
their feet, strike an erect military attitude, then draw <lb/>
their swords; the swords of all their brethren standing <lb/>
guard at the innumerable tables would flash from their <lb/>
scabbards and be held aloft&#x2014;a handsome spectacle! <lb/>
Three clear bugle notes would ring out, then all these <lb/>
swords would come down with a crash, twice repeated, <lb/>
on the tables, and be uplifted and held aloft again; <lb/>
then in the distance you would see the gay uniforms <lb/>
and uplifted swords of a guard of honor clearing the <lb/>
way and conducting the guest down to his place. The <lb/>
<pb n="516"/>
songs were stirring, the immense outpour from young <lb/>
life and young lungs, the crash of swords and the <lb/>
thunder of the beer mugs gradually worked a body up <lb/>
to what seemed the last possible summit of excitement. <lb/>
It surely seemed to me that I had reached that summit, <lb/>
that I had reached my limit, and that there was no <lb/>
higher lift desirable for me. When apparently the last <lb/>
eminent guest had long ago taken his place, again those <lb/>
three bugle blasts rang out and once more the swords <lb/>
leaped from their scabbards. Who might this late <lb/>
comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, <lb/>
indolent eyes were turned towards the distant entrance; <lb/>
we saw the silken gleam and the lifted swords of a <lb/>
guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. <lb/>
Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; <lb/>
saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along, like a <lb/>
wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one <lb/>
before. Then there was an excited whisper at our <lb/>
table&#x2014;"<smcap>Mommsen</smcap>!" and the whole house rose. <lb/>
Rose and shouted and stamped and clapped, and <lb/>
banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm! Then <lb/>
the little man with his long hair and Emersonian face <lb/>
edged his way past us and took his seat. I could have <lb/>
touched him with my hand&#x2014;Mommsen!&#x2014;think <lb/>
of it!</p>
<p>This was one of those immense surprises that can <lb/>
happen only a few times in one's life. I was not <lb/>
dreaming of him, he was to me only a giant myth, a <lb/>
world-shadowing specter, not a reality. The surprise of <lb/>
it all can be only comparable to a man's suddenly coming <lb/>
upon Mont Blanc with its awful form towering into <lb/>
the sky, when he didn't suspect he was in its neighbor- <lb/>
hood. I would have walked a great many miles to get <lb/>
a sight of him, and here he was, without trouble or <lb/>
tramp or cost of any kind. Here he was, clothed in a <lb/>
Titanic deceptive modesty which made him look like <lb/>
<pb n="517"/>
other men. Here he was, carrying the Roman world <lb/>
and all the C&#x00E6;sars in his hospitable skull, and doing it <lb/>
as easily as that other luminous vault, the skull of the <lb/>
universe, carries the Milky Way and the constellations.</p>
<p>One of the professors said that once upon a time an <lb/>
American young lady was introduced to Mommsen, <lb/>
and found herself badly scared and speechless. She <lb/>
dreaded to see his mouth unclose, for she was expect- <lb/>
ing him to choose a subject several miles above her <lb/>
comprehension, and didn't suppose he <i>could</i> get down <lb/>
to the world that other people lived in; but when his <lb/>
remark came, her terrors disappeared: "Well, how do <lb/>
you do? Have you read Howells's last book? <i>I</i> <lb/>
think it's his best."</p>
<p>The active ceremonies of the evening closed with the <lb/>
speeches of welcome delivered by two students and the <lb/>
replies made by Professors Virchow and Helmholtz.</p>
<p>Virchow has long been a member of the city govern- <lb/>
ment of Berlin. He works as hard for the city as does <lb/>
any other Berlin alderman, and gets the same pay&#x2014; <lb/>
nothing. I don't know that we in America could <lb/>
venture to ask our most illustrious citizen to serve in a <lb/>
board of aldermen, and if we might venture it I am <lb/>
not positively sure that we could elect him. But here <lb/>
the municipal system is such that the best men in the <lb/>
city consider it an honor to serve gratis as aldermen, <lb/>
and the people have the good sense to prefer these <lb/>
men and to elect them year after year. As a result, <lb/>
Berlin is a thoroughly well-governed city. It is a free <lb/>
city; its affairs are not meddled with by the State; <lb/>
they are managed by its own citizens, and after meth- <lb/>
ods of their own devising.</p>

</opener>
<p><smcap>Madam:</smcap> You will remember that last May Mr. <lb/>
Edward Bright, the clerk of the Inland Revenue <lb/>
Office, wrote me about a tax which he said was due <lb/>
from me to the Government on books of mine pub- <lb/>
lished in London&#x2014;that is to say, an income tax on <lb/>
the royalties. I do not know Mr. Bright, and it is <lb/>
embarrassing to me to correspond with strangers; for <lb/>
I was raised in the country and have always lived there, <lb/>
the early part in Marion County, Missouri, before the <lb/>
war, and this part in Hartford County, Connecticut, <lb/>
near Bloomfield and about eight miles this side of <lb/>
Farmington, though some call it nine, which it is im- <lb/>
possible to be, for I have walked it many and many a <lb/>
time in considerably under three hours, and General <lb/>
Hawley says he has done it in two and a quarter, which <lb/>
is not likely; so it has seemed best that I write your <lb/>
Majesty. It is true that I do not know your Majesty <lb/>
personally, but I have met the Lord Mayor, and if the <lb/>
rest of the family are like him, it is but just that it <lb/>
should be named royal; and likewise plain that in a <lb/>
family matter like this, I cannot better forward my case <lb/>
than to frankly carry it to the head of the family itself. <lb/>
I have also met the Prince of Wales once in the fall of <lb/>
1873, but it was not in any familiar way, but in a quite <lb/>
informal way, being casual, and was, of course, a sur- <lb/>
prise to us both. It was in Oxford street, just where <lb/>
<pb n="519"/>
you come out of Oxford into Regent Circus, and just <lb/>
as he turned up one side of the circle at the head of a <lb/>
procession, I went down the other side on the top of <lb/>
an omnibus. He will remember me on account of a <lb/>
gray coat with flap pockets that I wore, as I was the <lb/>
only person on the omnibus that had on that kind of a <lb/>
coat; I remember him of course as easy as I would a <lb/>
comet. He looked quite proud and satisfied, but that <lb/>
is not to be wondered at, he has a good situation. <lb/>
And once I called on your Majesty, but you were out.</p>
<p>But that is no matter, it happens with everybody. <lb/>
However, I have wandered a little away from what I <lb/>
started about. It was this way. Young Bright wrote <lb/>
my London publishers, Chatto and Windus&#x2014;their <lb/>
place is the one on the left as you come down Picca- <lb/>
dilly, about a block and a half above where the minstrel <lb/>
show is&#x2014;he wrote them that he wanted them to pay <lb/>
income tax on the royalties of some foreign authors, <lb/>
namely, "Miss De La Ram&#x00E9; (Ouida), Dr. Oliver <lb/>
Wendell Holmes, Mr. Francis Bret Harte, and Mr. <lb/>
Mark Twain." Well, Mr. Chatto diverted him from <lb/>
the others, and tried to divert him from me, but in this <lb/>
case he failed. So then young Bright wrote me. And <lb/>
not only that, but he sent me a printed document the <lb/>
size of a newspaper for me to sign all over in different <lb/>
places. Well, it was that kind of a document that the <lb/>
more you study it the more it undermines you and <lb/>
makes everything seem uncertain to you; and so, while <lb/>
in that condition, and really not responsible for my <lb/>
acts, I wrote Mr. Chatto to pay the tax and charge to <lb/>
me. Of course, my idea was, that it was for only one <lb/>
year, and that the tax would be only about one per <lb/>
cent, or along there somewhere, but last night I met <lb/>
Professor Sloane of Princeton&#x2014;you may not know <lb/>
him, but you have probably seen him every now and <lb/>
then, for he goes to England a good deal, a large man <lb/>
<pb n="520"/>
and very handsome and absorbed in thought, and if <lb/>
you have noticed such a man on platforms after the <lb/>
train is gone, that is the one, he generally gets left, <lb/>
like all those specialists and other scholars who know <lb/>
everything but how to apply it&#x2014;and he said it was a <lb/>
back tax for <i>three</i> years, and not one per cent., but <lb/>
two and a half!</p>
<p>That gave what had seemed a little matter a new <lb/>
aspect. I then began to study the printed document <lb/>
again, to see if I could find anything in it that might <lb/>
modify my case, and I had what seems to be a quite <lb/>
promising success. For instance, it opens thus&#x2014;polite <lb/>
and courteous, the way those English government <lb/>
documents always are&#x2014;I do not say that to hear <lb/>
myself talk, it is just the fact, and it is a credit:</p>
<p>"<smcap>To Mr. Mark Twain</smcap>: IN PURSUANCE of the <lb/>
Acts of Parliament for granting to Her Majesty Duties <lb/>
and Profits," etc.</p>
<p>I had not noticed that before. My idea had been <lb/>
that it was for the Government, and so I wrote <i>to</i> the <lb/>
Government; but now I saw that it was a private <lb/>
matter, a family matter, and that the proceeds went to <lb/>
yourself, not the Government. I would always rather <lb/>
treat with principals, and I am glad I noticed that <lb/>
clause. With a principal, one can always get at a fair <lb/>
and right understanding, whether it is about potatoes, <lb/>
or continents, or any of those things, or something <lb/>
entirely different; for the size or nature of the thing <lb/>
does not affect the fact; whereas, as a rule, a subordinate <lb/>
is more or less troublesome to satisfy. And yet this is <lb/>
not against them, but the other way. They have their <lb/>
duties to do, and must be harnessed to rules, and not <lb/>
allowed any discretion. Why, if your Majesty should <lb/>
equip young Bright with discretion&#x2014;I mean his own <lb/>
discretion&#x2014;it is an even guess that he would discretion <lb/>
you out of house and home in two or three years. He <lb/>
<pb n="521"/>
would not <i>mean</i> to get the family into straits, but that <lb/>
would be the upshot, just the same. Now, then, with <lb/>
Bright out of the way, this is not going to be any Irish <lb/>
question; it is going to be settled pleasantly and satis- <lb/>
factorily for all of us, and when it is finished your <lb/>
Majesty is going to stand with the American people <lb/>
just as you have stood for fifty years, and surely no <lb/>
monarch can require better than that of an alien nation. <lb/>
They do not all pay a British income tax, but the most <lb/>
of them will in time, for we have shoals of new authors <lb/>
coming along every year; and of the population of <lb/>
your Canada, upwards of four-fifths are wealthy <lb/>
Americans, and more going there all the time.</p>
<p>Well, another thing which I noticed in the Document <lb/>
was an item about "Deductions." I will come to <lb/>
that presently, your Majesty. And another thing was <lb/>
this: that Authors are not mentioned in the Document <lb/>
at all. No, we have "Quarries, Mines, Iron Works, <lb/>
Salt Springs, Alum Mines, Water Works, Canals, <lb/>
Docks, Drains, Levels, Fishings, Fairs, Tolls, Bridges, <lb/>
Ferries," and so forth and so forth and so on&#x2014;well, <lb/>
as much as a yard or a yard and a half of them, I <lb/>
should think&#x2014;anyway a very large quantity or num- <lb/>
ber. I read along&#x2014;down, and down, and down the <lb/>
list, further, and further, and further, and as I ap- <lb/>
proached the bottom my hopes began to rise higher <lb/>
and higher, because I saw that everything in England <lb/>
<i>that</i> far was taxed by name and in detail, except per- <lb/>
haps the family, and maybe Parliament, and yet still <lb/>
no mention of Authors. Apparently they were going <lb/>
to be overlooked. And sure enough, they were! My <lb/>
heart gave a great bound. But I was too soon. There <lb/>
was a footnote, in Mr. Bright's hand, which said: <lb/>
"You are taxed under Schedule D, section 14." I <lb/>
turned to that place, and found these three things: <lb/>
"Trades, Offices, Gas Works."</p>
<pb n="522"/>
<p>Of course, after a moment's reflection, hope came <lb/>
up again, and then certainty: Mr. Bright was in error, <lb/>
and clear off the track; for Authorship is not a Trade, <lb/>
it is an inspiration; Authorship does not keep an <lb/>
Office, its habitation is all out under the sky, and every- <lb/>
where where the winds are blowing and the sun is <lb/>
shining and the creatures of God are free. Now, then, <lb/>
since I have no Trade and keep no Office, I am not <lb/>
taxable under Schedule D, section 14. Your Majesty <lb/>
sees that; so I will go on to that other thing that I <lb/>
spoke of, the "deductions"&#x2014;deductions from my <lb/>
tax which I may get allowed, under conditions. Mr. <lb/>
Bright says all deductions to be claimed by me must be <lb/>
restricted to the provisions made in Paragraph No. 8, <lb/>
entitled "Wear and Tear of Machinery, or Plant." <lb/>
This is curious, and shows how far he has gotten away <lb/>
on his wrong course after once he has got started <lb/>
wrong: for Offices and Trades do not have Plant, they <lb/>
do not have Machinery, such a thing was never heard <lb/>
of; and, moreover, they do not wear and tear. You <lb/>
see that, your Majesty, and that it is true. Here is the <lb/>
Paragraph No. 8: <lb/>
<q>Amount claimed as a deduction for diminished value by reason of Wear <lb/>
and Tear, where the Machinery or Plant belongs to the Person or Company <lb/>
carrying on the Concern, or is let to such Person or Company so that the <lb/>
Lessee is bound to maintain and deliver over the same in good condition:&#x2014;</q>
<q><i>Amount &#x00A3;</i><gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/></q></p>
<p>There it is&#x2014;the very words.</p>
<p>I could answer Mr. Bright thus.</p>
<p>It is my pride to say that my Brain is my Plant; <lb/>
and I do not claim any deduction for diminished value <lb/>
by reason of Wear and Tear, for the reason that it <lb/>
does not wear and tear, but stays sound and whole all <lb/>
the time. Yes, I could say to him, my Brain is my <lb/>
Plant, my Skull is my Workshop, my Hand is my <lb/>
<pb n="523"/>
Machinery, and I am the Person carrying on the Con- <lb/>
cern; it is not leased to anybody, and so there is no <lb/>
Lessee bound to maintain and deliver over the same in <lb/>
good condition. There. I do not wish to any way <lb/>
overrate this argument and answer, dashed off just so, <lb/>
and not a word of it altered from the way I first wrote <lb/>
it, your Majesty, but, indeed, it does seem to pulverize <lb/>
that young fellow, you can see that yourself. But <lb/>
that is all I say; I stop there; I never pursue a person <lb/>
after I have got him down.</p>
<p>Having thus shown your Majesty that I am not <lb/>
taxable, but am the victim of the error of a clerk who <lb/>
mistakes the nature of my commerce, it only remains <lb/>
for me to beg that you will of your justice annul my <lb/>
letter that I spoke of, so that my publisher can keep <lb/>
back that tax-money which, in the confusion and <lb/>
aberration caused by the Document, I ordered him to <lb/>
pay. You will not miss the sum, but this is a hard <lb/>
year for authors; and as for lectures, I do not suppose <lb/>
your Majesty ever saw such a dull season.</p>
<p>With always great and ever increasing respect, I beg <lb/>
to sign myself your Majesty's servant to command,</p>

<head><b>A MAJESTIC LITERARY FOSSIL</b></head>
<p><smcap>If i</smcap> were required to guess off-hand, and with collu- <lb/>
sion with higher minds, what is the bottom cause <lb/>
of the amazing material and intellectual advancement <lb/>
of the last fifty years, I should guess that it was the <lb/>
modern-born and previously non-existent disposition <lb/>
on the part of men to believe that a new idea can have <lb/>
value. With the long roll of the mighty names of <lb/>
history present in our minds, we are not privileged to <lb/>
doubt that for the past twenty or thirty centuries every <lb/>
conspicuous civilization in the world has produced <lb/>
intellects able to invent and create the things which <lb/>
make our day a wonder; perhaps we may be justified <lb/>
in inferring, then, that the reason they did not do it <lb/>
was that the public reverence for old ideas and hostility <lb/>
to new ones always stood in their way, and was a wall <lb/>
they could not break down or climb over. The pre- <lb/>
vailing tone of old books regarding new ideas is one of <lb/>
suspicion and uneasiness at times, and at other times <lb/>
contempt. By contrast, our day is indifferent to old <lb/>
ideas, and even considers that their age makes their <lb/>
value questionable, but jumps at a new idea with enthu- <lb/>
siasm and high hope&#x2014;a hope which is high because it <lb/>
has not been accustomed to being disappointed. I <lb/>
make no guess as to just when this disposition was <lb/>
born to us, but it certainly is ours, was not possessed <lb/>
by any century before us, is our peculiar mark and <lb/>
badge, and is doubtless the bottom reason why we are <lb/>
<pb n="525"/>
a race of lightning-shod Mercuries, and proud of it&#x2014; <lb/>
instead of being, like our ancestors, a race of plodding <lb/>
crabs, and proud of that.</p>
<p>So recent is this change from a three or four thou- <lb/>
sand year twilight to the flash and glare of open day <lb/>
that I have walked in both, and yet am not old. <lb/>
Nothing is to-day as it was when I was an urchin; but <lb/>
when I was an urchin, nothing was much different from <lb/>
what it had always been in this world. Take a single <lb/>
detail, for example&#x2014;medicine. Galen could have <lb/>
come into my sick-room at any time during my first <lb/>
seven years&#x2014;I mean any day when it wasn't fishing <lb/>
weather, and there wasn't any choice but school or <lb/>
sickness&#x2014;and he could have sat down there and stood <lb/>
my doctor's watch without asking a question. He <lb/>
would have smelt around among the wilderness of cups <lb/>
and bottles and vials on the table and the shelves, and <lb/>
missed not a stench that used to glad him two thousand <lb/>
years before, nor discovered one that was of a later <lb/>
date. He would have examined me, and run across <lb/>
only one disappointment&#x2014;I was already salivated; I <lb/>
would have him there; for I was always salivated, <lb/>
calomel was so cheap. He would get out his lancet <lb/>
then; but I would have him again; our family doctor <lb/>
didn't allow blood to accumulate in the system. How- <lb/>
ever, he could take dipper and ladle, and freight me <lb/>
up with old familiar doses that had come down from <lb/>
Adam to his time and mine; and he could go out with <lb/>
a wheelbarrow and gather weeds and offal, and build <lb/>
some more, while those others were getting in their <lb/>
work. And if our reverend doctor came and found <lb/>
him there, he would be dumb with awe, and would get <lb/>
down and worship him. Whereas if Galen should ap- <lb/>
pear among us to-day, he could not stand anybody's <lb/>
watch; he would inspire no awe; he would be told he <lb/>
was a back number, and it would surprise him to see <lb/>
<pb n="526"/>
that that fact counted against him, instead of in his <lb/>
favor. He wouldn't know our medicines; he wouldn't <lb/>
know our practice; and the first time he tried to intro- <lb/>
duce his own we would hang him.</p>
<p>This introduction brings me to my literary relic. It <lb/>
is a <i>Dictionary of Medicine</i>, by Dr. James, of London, <lb/>
assisted by Mr. Boswell's Doctor Samuel Johnson, and <lb/>
is a hundred and fifty years old, it having been pub- <lb/>
lished at the time of the rebellion of '45. If it had <lb/>
been sent against the Pretender's troops there probably <lb/>
wouldn't have been a survivor. In 1861 this deadly <lb/>
book was still working the cemeteries&#x2014;down in Vir- <lb/>
ginia. For three generations and a half it had been <lb/>
going quietly along, enriching the earth with its slain. <lb/>
Up to its last free day it was trusted and believed in, <lb/>
and its devastating advice taken, as was shown by notes <lb/>
inserted between its leaves. But our troops captured <lb/>
it and brought it home, and it has been out of business <lb/>
since. These remarks from its preface are in the true <lb/>
spirit of the olden time, sodden with worship of the <lb/>
old, disdain of the new: <lb/>
<q>If we inquire into the Improvements which have been made by the <lb/>
Moderns, we shall be forced to confess that we have so little Reason to <lb/>
value ourselves beyond the Antients, or to be tempted to contemn them, <lb/>
that we cannot give stronger or more convincing Proofs of our own Ignor- <lb/>
ance, as well as our Pride.</q>
<q>Among all the systematical Writers, I think there are very few who <lb/>
refuse the Preference to <i>Hieron, Fabricius ab Aquapendente</i>, as a Person of <lb/>
unquestion'd Learning and Judgment; and yet is he not asham'd to let his <lb/>
Readers know that <i>Celsus</i> among the Latins, <i>Paulus Aegineta</i> among the <lb/>
Greeks, and <i>Albucasis</i> among the Arabians, whom I am unwilling to place <lb/>
among the Moderns, tho' he liv'd but six hundred Years since, are the <lb/>
Triumvirate to whom he principally stands indebted, for the Assistance he <lb/>
had receiv'd from them in composing his excellent Book.</q>
<q>[In a previous paragraph are puffs of Galen, Hippocrates, and other <lb/>
d&#x00E9;bris of the Old Silurian Period of Medicine.] How many Operations <lb/>
are there now in Use which were unknown to the Antients?</q></p>
<pb n="527"/>
<p>That is true. The surest way for a nation's scien- <lb/>
tific men to prove that they were proud and ignorant <lb/>
was to claim to have found out something fresh in the <lb/>
course of a thousand years or so. Evidently the peo- <lb/>
ples of this book's day regarded themselves as children, <lb/>
and their remote ancestors as the only grown-up people <lb/>
that had existed. Consider the contrast: without <lb/>
offense, without over-egotism, our own scientific men <lb/>
may and do regard themselves as grown people and <lb/>
their grandfathers as children. The change here pre- <lb/>
sented is probably the most sweeping that has ever <lb/>
come over mankind in the history of the race. It is <lb/>
the utter reversal, in a couple of generations, of an <lb/>
attitude which had been maintained without challenge <lb/>
or interruption from the earliest antiquity. It amounts <lb/>
to creating man over again on a new plan; he was a <lb/>
canal-boat before, he is an ocean greyhound to-day. <lb/>
The change from reptile to bird was not more tre- <lb/>
mendous, and it took longer.</p>
<p>It is curious. If you read between the lines what <lb/>
this author says about Brer Albucasis, you detect that <lb/>
in venturing to compliment him he has to whistle a <lb/>
little to keep his courage up, because Albucasis "liv'd <lb/>
but six hundred Years since," and therefore came so <lb/>
uncomfortably near being a "modern" that one <lb/>
couldn't respect him without risk.</p>
<p>Phlebotomy, Venesection&#x2014;terms to signify bleeding <lb/>
&#x2014;are not often heard in our day, because we have <lb/>
ceased to believe that the best way to make a bank or <lb/>
a body healthy is to squander its capital; but in our <lb/>
author's time the physician went around with a hatful <lb/>
of lancets on his person all the time, and took a hack <lb/>
at every patient whom he found still alive. He robbed <lb/>
his man of pounds and pounds of blood at a single <lb/>
operation. The details of this sort in this book make <lb/>
terrific reading. Apparently even the healthy did not <lb/>
<pb n="528"/>
escape, but were bled twelve times a year, on a par- <lb/>
ticular day of the month, and exhaustively purged <lb/>
besides. Here is a specimen of the vigorous old-time <lb/>
practice; it occurs in our author's adoring biography <lb/>
of a Doctor Aret&#x00E6;us, a licensed assassin of Homer's <lb/>
time, or thereabouts: <lb/>
<q>In a Quinsey he used Venesection, and allow'd the Blood to flow till <lb/>
the Patient was ready to faint away.</q></p>
<p>There is no harm in trying to cure a headache&#x2014;in <lb/>
our day. You can't do it, but you get more or less <lb/>
entertainment out of trying, and that is something; <lb/>
besides, you live to tell about it, and that is more. A <lb/>
century or so ago you could have had the first of these <lb/>
features in rich variety, but you might fail of the other <lb/>
once&#x2014;and once would do. I quote: <lb/>
<q>As Dissections of Persons who have died of severe Head-achs, which <lb/>
have been related by Authors, are too numerous to be inserted in this Place, <lb/>
we shall here abridge some of the most curious and important Observations <lb/>
relating to this Subject, collected by the celebrated <i>Bonetus</i>.</q></p>
<p>The celebrated Bonetus's "Observation No. 1" <lb/>
seems to me a sufficient sample, all by itself, of what <lb/>
people used to have to stand any time between the <lb/>
creation of the world and the birth of your father and <lb/>
mine when they had the disastrous luck to get a <lb/>
"Head-ach": <lb/>
<q>A certain Merchant, about forty Years of Age, of a Melancholic Habit, <lb/>
and deeply involved in the Cares of the World, was, during the Dog-days, <lb/>
seiz'd with a violent pain of his Head, which some time after oblig'd him <lb/>
to keep his Bed.</q>
<q>I, being call'd, order'd Venesection in the Arms, the Application of <lb/>
Leeches to the Vessels of his Nostrils, Forehead, and Temples, as also to <lb/>
those behind his Ears; I likewise prescrib'd the Application of Cupping- <lb/>
glasses, with Scarification, to his Back: But, notwithstanding these Pre- <lb/>
cautions, he dy'd. If any Surgeon, skill'd in Arteriotomy, had been <lb/>
present, I should have also order'd that Operation.</q></p>
<pb n="529"/>
<p>I looked for "Arteriotomy" in this same Diction- <lb/>
ary, and found this definition: "The opening of an <lb/>
Artery with a View of taking away Blood." Here was <lb/>
a person who was being bled in the arms, forehead, <lb/>
nostrils, back, temples, and behind the ears, yet the <lb/>
celebrated Bonetus was not satisfied, but wanted to <lb/>
open an artery, "with a View" to insert a pump, <lb/>
probably. "Notwithstanding these Precautions"&#x2014; <lb/>
he dy'd. No art of speech could more quaintly con- <lb/>
vey this butcher's innocent surprise. Now that we <lb/>
know what the celebrated Bonetus did when he wanted <lb/>
to relieve a Head-ach, it is no trouble to infer that if <lb/>
he wanted to comfort a man that had a Stomach-ach <lb/>
he disemboweled him.</p>
<p>I have given one "Observation"&#x2014;a single Head- <lb/>
ach case; but the celebrated Bonetus follows it with <lb/>
eleven more. Without enlarging upon the matter, I <lb/>
merely note this coincidence&#x2014;they all "dy'd." Not <lb/>
one of these people got well; yet this obtuse hyena <lb/>
sets down every little gory detail of the several assas- <lb/>
sinations as complacently as if he imagined he was <lb/>
doing a useful and meritorious work in perpetuating <lb/>
the methods of his crimes. "Observations," indeed! <lb/>
They are confessions.</p>
<p>According to this book, "the Ashes of an Ass's <lb/>
hoof mix'd with Woman's milk cures chilblains." <lb/>
Length of time required not stated. Another item: <lb/>
"The constant Use of Milk is bad for the Teeth, and <lb/>
causes them to rot, and loosens the Gums." Yet in <lb/>
our day babies use it constantly without hurtful results. <lb/>
This author thinks you ought to wash out your mouth <lb/>
with wine before venturing to drink milk. Presently, <lb/>
when we come to notice what fiendish decoctions those <lb/>
people introduce into their stomachs by way of medi- <lb/>
cine, we shall wonder that they could have been afraid <lb/>
of milk.</p>
<pb n="530"/>
<p>It appears that they had false teeth in those days. <lb/>
They were made of ivory sometimes, sometimes of <lb/>
bone, and were thrust into the natural sockets, and <lb/>
lashed to each other and to the neighboring teeth with <lb/>
wires or with silk threads. They were not to eat with, <lb/>
nor to laugh with, because they dropped out when not <lb/>
in repose. You could smile with them, but you had <lb/>
to practice first, or you would overdo it. They were <lb/>
not for business, but just decoration. They filled the <lb/>
bill according to their lights.</p>
<p>This author says "the Flesh of Swine nourishes <lb/>
above all other eatables." In another place he men- <lb/>
tions a number of things, and says "these are very <lb/>
easy to be digested; so is Pork." This is probably a <lb/>
lie. But he is pretty handy in that line; and when he <lb/>
hasn't anything of the sort in stock himself he gives <lb/>
some other expert an opening. For instance, under the <lb/>
head of "Attractives" he introduces Paracelsus, who <lb/>
tells of a nameless "Specific"&#x2014;quantity of it not set <lb/>
down&#x2014;which is able to draw a hundred pounds of <lb/>
flesh to itself&#x2014;distance not stated&#x2014;and then pro- <lb/>
ceeds, "It happen'd in our own Days that an Attrac- <lb/>
tive of this Kind drew a certain Man's Lungs up into <lb/>
his Mouth, by which he had the Misfortune to be <lb/>
suffocated." This is more than doubtful. In the first <lb/>
place, his Mouth couldn't accommodate his Lungs&#x2014; <lb/>
in fact, his Hat couldn't; secondly, his Heart being <lb/>
more eligibly Situated, it would have got the Start of <lb/>
his Lungs, and, being a lighter Body, it would have <lb/>
Sail'd in ahead and Occupied the Premises; thirdly, <lb/>
you will Take Notice a Man with his Heart in his <lb/>
Mouth hasn't any Room left for his Lungs&#x2014;he has <lb/>
got all he can Attend to; and finally, the Man must <lb/>
have had the Attractive in his Hat, and when he saw <lb/>
what was going to Happen he would have Remov'd it <lb/>
and Sat Down on it. Indeed, he would; and then <lb/>
<pb n="531"/>
how could it Choke him to Death? I don't believe the <lb/>
thing ever happened at all.</p>
<p>Paracelsus adds this effort: "I myself saw a Plaister <lb/>
which attracted as much Water as was sufficient to fill <lb/>
a Cistern; and by these very Attractives Branches may <lb/>
be torn from Trees; and, which is still more surprising, <lb/>
a Cow may be carried up into the Air." Paracelsus is <lb/>
dead now; he was always straining himself that way.</p>
<p>They liked a touch of mystery along with their medi- <lb/>
cine in the olden time; and the medicine-man of that <lb/>
day, like the medicine-man of our Indian tribes, did <lb/>
what he could to meet the requirement: <lb/>
<q><i>Arcanum</i>. A Kind of Remedy whose Manner of Preparation, or <lb/>
singular Efficacy, is industriously concealed, in order to enchance its Value. <lb/>
By the Chymists it is generally defined a thing secret, incorporeal, and <lb/>
immortal, which cannot be Known by Man, unless by Experience; for it is <lb/>
the Virtue of every thing, which operates a thousand times more than the <lb/>
thing itself.</q></p>
<p>To me the butt end of this explanation is not alto- <lb/>
gether clear. A little of what they knew about natural <lb/>
history in the early times is exposed here and there in <lb/>
the Dictionary.</p>
<q><i>The Spider</i>. It is more common than welcome in Houses. Both the <lb/>
Spider and its Web are used in Medicine: The Spider is said to avert the <lb/>
Paroxysms of Fevers, if it be apply'd to the Pulse of the Wrist, or the <lb/>
Temples; but it is peculiarly recommended against a Quartan, being enclosed <lb/>
in the Shell of a Hazlenut.</q>
<q>Among approved Remedies, I find that the distill'd Water of Black <lb/>
Spiders is an excellent Cure for Wounds, and that this was one of the choice <lb/>
Secrets of Sir Walter Raleigh.</q>
<q>The Spider which some call the Catcher, or Wolf, being beaten into a <lb/>
Plaister, then sew'd up in Linen, and apply'd to the Forehead or Temples, <lb/>
prevents the Returns of a Tertian.</q>
<q>There is another Kind of Spider, which spins a white, fine, and thick <lb/>
Web. One of this Sort, wrapp'd in Leather, and hung about the Arm, will <lb/>
avert the Fit of a Quartan. Boil'd in Oil of Roses, and instilled into the <lb/>
Ears, it eases Pains in those Parts. <i>Dioscorides, Lib</i>. 2, <i>Cap</i>. 68.</q>
<pb n="532"/>
<q>Thus we find that Spiders have in all Ages been celebrated for their <lb/>
febrifuge Virtues; and it is worthy of Remark, that a Spider is usually given <lb/>
to Monkeys, and is esteem'd a sovereign Remedy for the Disorders those <lb/>
Animals are principally subject to.</q>
<p>Then follows a long account of how a dying woman, <lb/>
who had suffered nine hours a day with an ague during <lb/>
eight weeks, and who had been bled dry some dozens <lb/>
of times meantime without apparent benefit, was at last <lb/>
forced to swallow several wads of "Spiders-web," <lb/>
whereupon she straightway mended, and promptly got <lb/>
well. So the sage is full of enthusiasm over the spider- <lb/>
webs, and mentions only in the most casual way the <lb/>
discountenance of the daily bleedings, plainly never <lb/>
suspecting that this had anything to do with the cure.</p>
<q>As concerning the venomous Nature of Spiders, <i>Scaliger</i> takes notice of <lb/>
a certain Species of them (which he had forgotten) whose Poison was of so <lb/>
great Force as to affect one <i>Vincentinus</i> thro' the Sole of his Shoe, by <lb/>
only treading on it.</q>
<p>The sage takes that in without a strain, but the fol- <lb/>
lowing case was a trifle too bulky for him, as his com- <lb/>
ment reveals: <lb/>
<q>In Gascony, observes <i>Scaliger</i>, there is a very small Spider, which, <lb/>
running over a Looking-glass, will crack the same by the Force of her <lb/>
Poison. (<i>A mere Fable.</i>)</q></p>
<p>But he finds no fault with the following facts: <lb/>
<q>Remarkable is the Enmity recorded between this Creature and the <lb/>
Serpent, as also the Toad: Of the former it is reported, That, lying (as he <lb/>
thinks securely) under the Shadow of some Tree, the Spider lets herself <lb/>
down by her Thread, and, striking her Proboscis or Sting into the Head, <lb/>
with that Force and Efficacy, injecting likewise her venomous Juice, that, <lb/>
wringing himself about, he immediately grows giddy, and quickly after dies.</q>
<q>When the Toad is bit or stung in Fight with this Creature, the Lizard, <lb/>
Adder, or other that is poisonous, she finds relief from Plantain, to which <lb/>
she resorts. In her Combat with the Toad, the Spider useth the same <lb/>
Stratagem as with the Serpent, hanging by her own Thread from the Bough <lb/>
<pb n="533"/>
of some Tree, and striking her Sting into her enemy's Head, upon which <lb/>
the other, enraged, swells up, and sometimes bursts.</q>
<q>To this Effect is the Relation of <i>Erasmus</i>, which he saith he had from <lb/>
one of the Spectators, of a Person lying along upon the Floor of his Cham- <lb/>
ber, in the Summer-time, to sleep in a supine Posture, when a Toad, <lb/>
creeping out of some green Rushes, brought just before in, to adorn the <lb/>
Chimney, gets upon his Face, and with his Feet sits across his Lips. To <lb/>
force off the Toad, says the Historian, would have been accounted sudden <lb/>
Death to the Sleeper; and to leave her there, very cruel and dangerous; so <lb/>
that upon Consultation it was concluded to find out a Spider, which, together <lb/>
with her Web, and the Window she was fasten'd to, was brought carefully, <lb/>
and so contrived as to be held perpendicularly to the Man's Face; which was <lb/>
no sooner done, but the Spider, discovering his Enemy, let himself down, <lb/>
and struck in his Dart, afterwards betaking himself up again to his Web; <lb/>
the Toad swell'd, but as yet kept his station: The second Wound is given <lb/>
quickly after by the Spider, upon which he swells yet more, but remain'd <lb/>
alive still.&#x2014;The Spider, coming down again by his Thread, gives the third <lb/>
Blow; and the Toad, taking off his Feet from over the Man's Mouth, fell <lb/>
off dead.</q></p>
<p>To which the sage appends this grave remark, "And <lb/>
so much for the historical Part." Then he passes on <lb/>
to a consideration of "the Effects and Cure of the <lb/>
Poison."</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about this tragedy <lb/>
is the double sex of the Toad, and also of the Spider.</p>
<p>Now the sage quotes from one Turner: <lb/>
<q>I remember, when a very young Practitioner, being sent for to a certain <lb/>
Woman, whose Custom was usually, when she went to the Cellar by Candle- <lb/>
light, to go also a Spider-hunting, setting Fire to their Webs, and burning <lb/>
them with the Flame of the Candle still as she pursued them. It happen'd <lb/>
at length, after this Whimsy had been follow'd a long time, one of them <lb/>
sold his Life much dearer than those Hundreds she had destroy'd; for, <lb/>
lighting upon the melting Tallow of her Candle, near the Flame, and his <lb/>
legs being entangled therein, so that he could not extricate himself, the <lb/>
Flame or Heat coming on, he was made a Sacrifice to his cruel Persecutor, <lb/>
who delighting her Eyes with the Spectacle, still waiting for the Flame to <lb/>
take hold of him, he presently burst with a great Crack, and threw his <lb/>
Liquor, some into her Eyes, but mostly upon her Lips; by means of which, <lb/>
<pb n="534"/>
flinging away her Candle, she cry'd out for Help, as fansying herself kill'd <lb/>
already with the Poison. However in the Night her Lips swell'd up <lb/>
excessively, and one of her Eyes was much inflam'd; also her Tongue and <lb/>
Gums were somewhat affected; and, whether from the Nausea excited by <lb/>
the Thoughts of the Liquor getting into her Mouth, or from the poisonous <lb/>
Impressions communicated by the nervous <i>Fibrill&#x00E6;</i> of those Parts to those <lb/>
of the Ventricle, a continual Vomiting attended: To take off which, when I <lb/>
was call'd, I order'd a Glass of mull'd Sack, with a Scruple of Salt of <lb/>
Wormwood, and some hours after a Theriacal Bolus, which she flung up <lb/>
again. I embrocated the Lips with the Oil of Scorpions mix'd with the Oil <lb/>
of Roses; and, in Consideration of the Ophthalmy, tho' I was not certain but <lb/>
the Heat of the Liquor, rais'd by the Flame of the Candle before the Body <lb/>
of the Creature burst, might, as well as the Venom, excite the Disturbance, <lb/>
(altho' Mr. <i>Boyle's</i> Case of a Person blinded by this Liquor dropping from <lb/>
the living Spider, makes the latter sufficient;) yet observing the great <lb/>
Tumefaction of the Lips, together with the other Symptoms not likely to <lb/>
arise from simple Heat, I was inclin'd to believe a real Poison in the Case; <lb/>
and therefore not daring to let her Blood in the Arm [If a man's throat <lb/>
were cut in those old days, the doctor would come and bleed the other end <lb/>
of him], I did, however, with good Success, set Leeches to her Temples, <lb/>
which took off much of the Inflammation; and her Pain was likewise <lb/>
abated, by instilling into her Eyes a thin Mucilage of the Seeds of Quinces <lb/>
and white Poppies extracted with Rose-water; yet the Swelling on the Lips <lb/>
increased; upon which, in the Night, she wore a Cataplasm prepared by <lb/>
boiling the Leaves of Scordium, Rue, and Elder-flowers, and afterwards <lb/>
thicken'd with the Meal of Vetches. In the mean time, her Vomiting <lb/>
having left her, she had given her, between whiles, a little Draught of <lb/>
Distill'd Water of Carduus Benedictus and Scordium, with some of the <lb/>
Theriaca dissolved; and upon going off of the Symptoms, an old Woman <lb/>
came luckily in, who, with Assurance suitable to those People, (whose Igno- <lb/>
rance and Poverty is their Safety and Protection,) took off the Dressings, <lb/>
promising to cure her in two Days time, altho' she made it as many Weeks, <lb/>
yet had the Reputation of the Cure; applying only Plantain Leaves bruis'd <lb/>
and mixed with Cobwebs, dropping the Juice into her Eye, and giving <lb/>
some Spoonfuls of the same inwardly, two or three times a day.</q></p>
<p>So ends the wonderful affair. Whereupon the sage <lb/>
gives Mr. Turner the following shot&#x2014;strengthening it <lb/>
with italics&#x2014;and passes calmly on: <lb/>
<q><i>"I must remark upon this History, that the Plantain, as a Cooler, was <lb/>
<pb n="535"/>
much more likely to cure this Disorder than warmer Applications and <lb/>
Medicines."</i></q></p>
<p>How strange that narrative sounds to-day, and how <lb/>
grotesque, when one reflects that it was a grave contri- <lb/>
bution to medical "science" by an old and reputable <lb/>
physician! Here was all this to-do&#x2014;two weeks of <lb/>
it&#x2014;over a woman who had scorched her eye and her <lb/>
lips with candle grease. The poor wench is as elabor- <lb/>
ately dosed, bled, embrocated, and otherwise harried <lb/>
and bedeviled as if there had been really something the <lb/>
matter with her; and when a sensible old woman <lb/>
comes along at last, and treats the trivial case in a <lb/>
sensible way, the educated ignoramus rails at her igno- <lb/>
rance, serenely unconscious of his own. It is pretty <lb/>
suggestive of the former snail-pace of medical progress <lb/>
that the spider retained his terrors during three thou- <lb/>
sand years, and only lost them within the last thirty or <lb/>
forty.</p>
<p>Observe what imagination can do. "This same <lb/>
young Woman" used to be so affected by the strong <lb/>
(imaginary) smell which emanated from the burning <lb/>
spiders that "the Objects about her seem'd to turn <lb/>
round; she grew faint also with cold Sweats, and <lb/>
sometimes a light Vomiting." There could have been <lb/>
Beer in that cellar as well as Spiders.</p>
<p>Here are some more of the effects of imagination: <lb/>
"<i>Sennertus</i> takes Notice of the Signs of the Bite or <lb/>
Sting of this Insect to be a Stupor or Numbness upon <lb/>
the Part, with a sense of Cold, Horror, or Swelling of <lb/>
the Abdomen, Paleness of the Face, involuntary Tears, <lb/>
Trembling, Contractions, a (****), Convulsions, cold <lb/>
Sweats; but these latter chiefly when the Poison has <lb/>
been received inwardly," whereas the modern physician <lb/>
holds that a few spiders taken inwardly, by a bird or a <lb/>
man, will do neither party any harm.</p>
<p>The above "Signs" are not restricted to spider <lb/>
<pb n="536"/>
bites&#x2014;often they merely indicate fright. I have seen <lb/>
a person with a hornet in his pantaloons exhibit them <lb/>
all.</p>
<q>As to the Cure, not slighting the usual Alexipharmics taken internally, <lb/>
the Place bitten must be immediately washed with Salt Water, or a Sponge <lb/>
dipped in hot Vinegar, or fomented with a Decoction of Mallows, Origanum, <lb/>
and Mother of Thyme; after which a Cataplasm must be laid on of the <lb/>
Leaves of Bay, Rue, Leeks, and the Meal of Barley, boiled with Vinegar, <lb/>
or of Garlick and Onions, contused with Goat's Dung and fat Figs. Mean <lb/>
time the Patient should eat Garlick and drink Wine freely.</q>
<p>As for me, I should prefer the spider bite. Let us <lb/>
close this review with a sample or two of the earth- <lb/>
quakes which the old-time doctor used to introduce <lb/>
into his patient when he could find room. Under this <lb/>
head we have "Alexander's Golden Antidote," which <lb/>
is good for&#x2014;well, pretty much everything. It is <lb/>
probably the old original first patent-medicine. It is <lb/>
built as follows: <lb/>
<q>Take of Afarabocca, Henbane, Carpobalsamum, each two Drams and a <lb/>
half; of Cloves, Opium, Myrrh, Cyperus, each two Drams: of Opobalsamum, <lb/>
Indian Leaf, Cinamon, Zedoary, Ginger, Coftus, Coral, Cassia, Euphorbium, <lb/>
Gum Tragacanth, Frankincense, Styrax Calamita, Celtic, Nard, Spignel, <lb/>
Hartwort, Mustard, Saxifrage, Dill, Anise, each one Dram; of Xylaloes, <lb/>
Rheum, Ponticum, Alipta Moschata, Castor, Spikenard, Galangals, Opop- <lb/>
onax, Anacardium, Mastich, Brimstone, Peony, Eringo, Pulp of Dates, red <lb/>
and white Hermodactyls, Roses, Thyme, Acorns, Penyroyal, Gentian, the <lb/>
Bark of the Root of Mandrake, Germander, Valerian, Bishops Weed, Bay- <lb/>
Berries, long and white Pepper, Xylobalsamum, Carnabadium, Macodonian, <lb/>
Parsley-seeds, Lovage, the Seeds of Rue, and Sinon, of each a Dram and a <lb/>
half; of pure Gold, pure Silver, Pearls not perforated, the Blatta Byzantina, <lb/>
the Bone of the Stag's Heart, of each the Quantity of fourteen Grains of <lb/>
Wheat; of Sapphire, Emerald, and Jasper Stones, each one Dram; of Hasle- <lb/>
nut, two Drams; of Pellitory of Spain, Shavings of Ivory, Calamus Odoratus, <lb/>
each the Quantity of twenty-nine Grains of Wheat; of Honey or Sugar a <lb/>
sufficient Quantity.</q></p>
<p>Serve with a shovel. No; one might expect such <lb/>
<pb n="537"/>
an injunction after such formidable preparation; but it <lb/>
is not so. The dose recommended is "the Quantity <lb/>
of an Hasle-nut." Only that; it is because there is <lb/>
so much jewelry in it, no doubt.</p>
<q><i>Aqua Limacum</i>. Take a great Peck of Garden-snails, and wash them <lb/>
in a great deal of Beer, and make your Chimney very clean, and set a <lb/>
Bushel of Charcoal on Fire; and when they are thoroughly kindled, make a <lb/>
Hole in the Middle of the Fire, and put the Snails in, and scatter more Fire <lb/>
amongst them, and let them roast till they make a Noise; then take them <lb/>
out, and, with a Knife and coarse Cloth, pick and wipe away all the green <lb/>
froth: Then break them, Shells and all, in a Stone Mortar. Take also a <lb/>
Quart of Earth-worms, and scour them with Salt, divers times over. Then <lb/>
take two Handfuls of Angelica and lay them in the Bottom of the Still; <lb/>
next lay two handfuls of Celandine; next a Quart of Rosemary-flowers; <lb/>
then two Handfuls of Bearsfoot and Agrimony; then Fenugreek; then <lb/>
Turmerick; of each one Ounce; Red Dock-root, Bark of Barberry-trees, <lb/>
Wood-sorrel, Betony, of each two Handfuls.&#x2014;Then lay the Snails and <lb/>
Worms on the top of the Herbs; and then two Handfuls of Goose-dung, <lb/>
and two Handfuls of Sheep-dung. Then put in three Gallons of Strong <lb/>
Ale, and place the pot where you mean to set Fire under it: Let it stand all <lb/>
Night, or longer; in the Morning put in three Ounces of Cloves well beaten, <lb/>
and a small Quantity of Saffron, dry'd to Powder; then six Ounces of Shav- <lb/>
ings of Hartshorn, which must be uppermost. Fix on the Head and <lb/>
Refrigeratory, and distil according to Art.</q>
<p>There. The book does not say whether this is all <lb/>
one dose, or whether you have a right to split it and <lb/>
take a second chance at it, in case you live. Also, the <lb/>
book does not seem to specify what ailment it was for; <lb/>
but it is of no consequence, for, of course, that would <lb/>
come out on the inquest.</p>
<p>Upon looking further, I find that this formidable <lb/>
nostrum is "good for raising Flatulencies in the <lb/>
Stomach"&#x2014;meaning <i>from</i> the stomach, no doubt. <lb/>
So it would appear that when our progenitors chanced <lb/>
to swallow a sigh, they emptied a sewer down their <lb/>
throats to expel it. It is like dislodging skippers from <lb/>
cheese with artillery.</p>
<pb n="538"/>
<p>When you reflect that your own father had to take <lb/>
such medicines as the above, and that you would be <lb/>
taking them to-day yourself but for the introduction of <lb/>
hom&#x0153;opathy, which forced the old-school doctor to <lb/>
stir around and learn something of a rational nature <lb/>
about his business, you may honestly feel grateful that <lb/>
hom&#x0153;opathy survived the attempts of the allopathists <lb/>
to destroy it, even though you may never employ any <lb/>
physician but an allopathist while you live.</p>
