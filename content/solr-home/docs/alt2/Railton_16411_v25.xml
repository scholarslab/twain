<head><b>PREFACE</b></head>
<p><smcap>Book I.</smcap> of this volume occupies a quarter or <lb/>
a third of the volume, and consists of matter <lb/>
written about four years ago, but not hitherto <lb/>
published in book form. It contained errors <lb/>
of judgment and of fact. I have now correct- <lb/>
ed these to the best of my ability and later <lb/>
knowledge.</p>
<p>Book II. was written at the beginning of <lb/>
1903, and has not until now appeared in any <lb/>
form. In it my purpose has been to present a <lb/>
character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from <lb/>
her own acts and words solely, not from hear- <lb/>
say and rumor; and to explain the nature and <lb/>
scope of her Monarchy, as revealed in the Laws <lb/>
by which she governs it, and which she wrote <lb/>
herself.</p>

<p><smcap>This</smcap> last summer, when I was on my way <lb/>
back to Vienna from the Appetite-Cure in the <lb/>
mountains, I fell over a cliff in the twilight <lb/>
and broke some arms and legs and one thing <lb/>
or another, and by good luck was found by <lb/>
some peasants who had lost an ass, and they <lb/>
carried me to the nearest habitation, which <lb/>
was one of those large, low, thatch - roofed <lb/>
farm-houses, with apartments in the garret for <lb/>
the family, and a cunning little porch under <lb/>
the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright- <lb/>
colored flowers and cats; on the ground-floor <lb/>
a large and light sitting-room, separated from <lb/>
<pb n="4"/>
the milch - cattle apartment by a partition; <lb/>
and in the front yard rose stately and fine the <lb/>
wealth and pride of the house, the manure- <lb/>
pile. That sentence is Germanic, and shows <lb/>
that I am acquiring that sort of mastery of <lb/>
the art and spirit of the language which en- <lb/>
ables a man to travel all day in one sentence <lb/>
without changing cars.</p>
<p>There was a village a mile away, and a horse- <lb/>
doctor lived there, but there was no surgeon. <lb/>
It seemed a bad outlook; mine was distinctly <lb/>
a surgery case. Then it was remembered that <lb/>
a lady from Boston was summering in that <lb/>
village, and she was a Christian Science doctor <lb/>
and could cure anything. So she was sent for. <lb/>
It was night by this time, and she could not <lb/>
conveniently come, but sent word that it was <lb/>
no matter, there was no hurry, she would <lb/>
give me "absent treatment" now, and come <lb/>
in the morning; meantime she begged me to <lb/>
make myself tranquil and comfortable and re- <lb/>
member that there was nothing the matter with <lb/>
me. I thought there must be some mistake.</p>
<p>"Did you tell her I walked off a cliff seventy- <lb/>
five feet high?"</p>
<pb n="5"/>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And struck a bowlder at the bottom and <lb/>
bounced?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And struck another one and bounced <lb/>
again?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And struck another one and bounced yet <lb/>
again?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And broke the bowlders?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That accounts for it; she is thinking of the <lb/>
bowlders. Why didn't you tell her I got hurt, <lb/>
too?"</p>
<p>"I did. I told her what you told me to tell <lb/>
her: that you were now but an incoherent se- <lb/>
ries of compound fractures extending from <lb/>
your scalp - lock to your heels, and that the <lb/>
comminuted projections caused you to look <lb/>
like a hat-rack."</p>
<p>"And it was after this that she wished me to <lb/>
remember that there was nothing the matter <lb/>
with me?"</p>
<p>"Those were her words."</p>
<pb n="6"/>
<p>"I do not understand it. I believe she has <lb/>
not diagnosed the case with sufficient care. Did <lb/>
she look like a person who was theorizing, or <lb/>
did she look like one who has fallen off preci- <lb/>
pices herself and brings to the aid of abstract <lb/>
science the confirmations of personal experi- <lb/>
ence?"</p>
<p>"<foreign lang="ger"><i>Bitte?</i></foreign>"</p>
<p>It was too large a contract for the <foreign lang="ger"><i>Stuben- <lb/>
madchen's</i></foreign> vocabulary; she couldn't call the <lb/>
hand. I allowed the subject to rest there, <lb/>
and asked for something to eat and smoke, <lb/>
and something hot to drink, and a basket to <lb/>
pile my legs in; but I could not have any of <lb/>
these things.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"She said you would need nothing at all."</p>
<p>"But I am hungry and thirsty, and in des- <lb/>
perate pain."</p>
<p>"She said you would have these delusions, <lb/>
but must pay no attention to them. She wants <lb/>
you to particularly remember that there are no <lb/>
such things as hunger and thirst and pain."</p>
<p>"She does, does she?"</p>
<p>"It is what she said."</p>
<pb n="7"/>
<p>"Does she seem to be in full and functionable <lb/>
possession of her intellectual plant, such as it is?"</p>
<p>"<foreign lang="ger"><i>Bitte?</i></foreign>"</p>
<p>"Do they let her run at large, or do they tie <lb/>
her up?"</p>
<p>"Tie her up?"</p>
<p>"There, good-night, run along; you are a <lb/>
good girl, but your mental <i>Geschirr</i> is not ar- <lb/>
ranged for light and airy conversation. Leave <lb/>
me to my delusions."</p>

<head><b><smcap>chapter ii</smcap></b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was a night of anguish, of course&#x2014;at least, <lb/>
I supposed it was, for it had all the symptoms <lb/>
of it&#x2014;but it passed at last, and the Christian <lb/>
Scientist came, and I was glad. She was mid- <lb/>
dle-aged, and large and bony, and erect, and <lb/>
had an austere face and a resolute jaw and a <lb/>
Roman beak and was a widow in the third de- <lb/>
gree, and her name was Fuller. I was eager to <lb/>
get to business and find relief, but she was dis- <lb/>
tressingly deliberate. She unpinned and un- <lb/>
hooked and uncoupled her upholsteries one by <lb/>
one, abolished the wrinkles with a flirt of her <lb/>
hand, and hung the articles up; peeled off her <lb/>
gloves and disposed of them, got a book out of <lb/>
her hand-bag, then drew a chair to the bedside, <lb/>
descended into it without hurry, and I hung out <lb/>
my tongue. She said, with pity but without <lb/>
passion:</p>
<p>"Return it to its receptacle. We deal with <lb/>
the mind only, not with its dumb servants."</p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>I could not offer my pulse, because the con- <lb/>
nection was broken; but she detected the apol- <lb/>
ogy before I could word it, and indicated by a <lb/>
negative tilt of her head that the pulse was an- <lb/>
other dumb servant that she had no use for. <lb/>
Then I thought I would tell her my symptoms <lb/>
and how I felt, so that she would understand <lb/>
the case; but that was another inconsequence, <lb/>
she did not need to know those things; more- <lb/>
over, my remark about how I felt was an abuse <lb/>
of language, a misapplication of terms.</p>
<p>"One does not <i>feel</i>," she explained; "there is <lb/>
no such thing as feeling: therefore, to speak of <lb/>
a non-existent thing as existent is a contradic- <lb/>
tion. Matter has no existence; nothing exists <lb/>
but mind; the mind cannot feel pain, it can <lb/>
only imagine it."</p>
<p>"But if it hurts, just the same&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"It doesn't. A thing which is unreal cannot <lb/>
exercise the functions of reality. Pain is un- <lb/>
real; hence, pain cannot hurt."</p>
<p>In making a sweeping gesture to indicate the <lb/>
act of shooing the illusion of pain out of the <lb/>
mind, she raked her hand on a pin in her dress, <lb/>
said "Ouch!" and went tranquilly on with her <lb/>
<pb n="10"/>
talk. "You should never allow yourself to <lb/>
speak of how you feel, nor permit others to ask <lb/>
you how you are feeling; you should never con- <lb/>
cede that you are ill, nor permit others to talk <lb/>
about disease or pain or death or similar non- <lb/>
existences in your presence. Such talk only <lb/>
encourages the mind to continue its empty <lb/>
imaginings." Just at that point the <i>Stuben- <lb/>
m&#x00E4;dchen</i> trod on the cat's tail, and the cat let <lb/>
fly a frenzy of cat-profanity. I asked, with <lb/>
caution:</p>
<p>"Is a cat's opinion about pain valuable?"</p>
<p>"A cat has no opinion; opinions proceed from <lb/>
mind only; the lower animals, being eternally <lb/>
perishable, have not been granted mind; with- <lb/>
out mind, opinion is impossible."</p>
<p>"She merely <i>imagined</i> she felt a pain&#x2014;the <lb/>
cat?"</p>
<p>"She cannot imagine a pain, for imagining is <lb/>
an effect of mind; without mind, there is no <lb/>
imagination. A cat has no imagination."</p>
<p>"Then she had a <i>real</i> pain?"</p>
<p>"I have already told you there is no such <lb/>
<i>thing</i> as real pain."</p>
<p>"It is strange and interesting. I do wonder <lb/>
<pb n="11"/>
what was the matter with the cat. Because, <lb/>
there being no such thing as a real pain, and <lb/>
she not being able to imagine an imaginary one, <lb/>
it would seem that God in His pity has com- <lb/>
pensated the cat with some kind of a mysteri- <lb/>
ous emotion usable when her tail is trodden on <lb/>
which, for the moment, joins cat and Christian <lb/>
in one common brotherhood of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>She broke in with an irritated&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Peace! The cat feels nothing, the Chris- <lb/>
tian feels nothing. Your empty and foolish <lb/>
imaginings are profanation and blasphemy, and <lb/>
can do you an injury. It is wiser and better <lb/>
and holier to recognize and confess that there <lb/>
is no such thing as disease or pain or death."</p>
<p>"I am full of imaginary tortures," I said, <lb/>
"but I do not think I could be any more un- <lb/>
comfortable if they were real ones. What must <lb/>
I do to get rid of them?"</p>
<p>"There is no occasion to get rid of them, <lb/>
since they do not exist. They are illusions <lb/>
propagated by matter, and matter has no ex- <lb/>
istence; there is no such thing as matter."</p>
<p>"It sounds right and clear, but yet it seems <lb/>
in a degree elusive; it seems to slip through, <lb/>
<pb n="12"/>
just when you think you are getting a grip <lb/>
on it.</p>
<p>"Explain."</p>
<p>"Well, for instance: if there is no such thing <lb/>
as matter, how can matter propagate things?"</p>
<p>In her compassion she almost smiled. She <lb/>
would have smiled if there were any such thing <lb/>
as a smile.</p>
<p>"It is quite simple," she said; "the funda- <lb/>
mental propositions of Christian Science ex- <lb/>
plain it, and they are summarized in the four <lb/>
following self-evident propositions: 1. God is <lb/>
All in all. 2. God is good. Good is Mind. <lb/>
3. God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter. <lb/>
4. Life, God, omnipotent Good, deny death, <lb/>
evil, sin, disease. There&#x2014;now you see."</p>
<p>It seemed nebulous; it did not seem to say <lb/>
anything about the difficulty in hand&#x2014;how <lb/>
non-existent matter can propagate illusions. <lb/>
I said, with some hesitancy:</p>
<p>"Does&#x2014;does it explain?"</p>
<p>"<i>Doesn't</i> it? Even if read backward it will <lb/>
do it."</p>
<p>With a budding hope, I asked her to do it <lb/>
backward.</p>
<pb n="13"/>
<p>"Very well. Disease sin evil death deny <lb/>
Good omnipotent God life matter is nothing all <lb/>
being Spirit God Mind is Good good is God all in <lb/>
All is God. There&#x2014;do you understand now?"</p>
<p>"It&#x2014;it&#x2014;well, it is plainer than it was before; <lb/>
still&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Could you try it some more ways?"</p>
<p>"As many as you like; it always means the <lb/>
same. Interchanged in any way you please it <lb/>
cannot be made to mean anything different <lb/>
from what it means when put in any other way. <lb/>
Because it is perfect. You can jumble it all up, <lb/>
and it makes no difference: it always comes out <lb/>
the way it was before. It was a marvellous <lb/>
mind that produced it. As a mental <foreign lang="fre"><i>tour de <lb/>
force</i></foreign> it is without a mate, it defies alike the <lb/>
simple, the concrete, and the occult."</p>
<p>"It seems to be a corker."</p>
<p>I blushed for the word, but it was out before <lb/>
I could stop it.</p>
<p>"A what?"</p>
<p>"A&#x2014;wonderful structure&#x2014;combination, so <lb/>
to speak, of profound thoughts&#x2014;unthinkable <lb/>
ones&#x2014;un&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="14"/>
<p>"It is true. Read backward, or forward, or <lb/>
perpendicularly, or at any given angle, these <lb/>
four propositions will always be found to agree <lb/>
in statement and proof."</p>
<p>"Ah&#x2014;proof. Now we are coming at it. The <lb/>
<i>statements</i> agree; they agree with&#x2014;with&#x2014;any- <lb/>
way, they agree; I noticed that; but what is it <lb/>
they prove&#x2014;I mean, in particular?"</p>
<p>"Why, nothing could be clearer. They <lb/>
prove: 1. <smcap>God</smcap>&#x2014;Principle, Life, Truth, Love, <lb/>
Soul, Spirit, Mind. Do you get that?"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;well, I seem to. Go on, please."</p>
<p>"2. <smcap>Man</smcap>&#x2014;God's universal idea, individual, <lb/>
perfect, eternal. Is it clear?"</p>
<p>"It&#x2014;I think so. Continue."</p>
<p>"3. <smcap>Idea</smcap>&#x2014;An image in Mind; the immedi- <lb/>
ate object of understanding. There it is&#x2014;the <lb/>
whole sublime Arcana of Christian Science in a <lb/>
nutshell. Do you find a weak place in it any- <lb/>
where?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;no; it seems strong."</p>
<p>"Very well. There is more. Those three <lb/>
constitute the Scientific Definition of Immor- <lb/>
tal Mind. Next, we have the Scientific Defini- <lb/>
tion of Mortal Mind. Thus. <smcap>First Degree:</smcap>
<pb n="15"/>
<i>Depravity</i>. 1. Physical&#x2014;Passions and appe- <lb/>
tites, fear, depraved will, pride, envy, deceit, <lb/>
hatred, revenge, sin, disease, death."</p>
<p>"Phantasms, madam&#x2014;unrealities, as I un- <lb/>
derstand it."</p>
<p>"Every one. <smcap>Second Degree:</smcap> <i>Evil Disap- <lb/>
pearing</i>. 1. Moral&#x2014;Honesty, affection, com- <lb/>
passion, hope, faith, meekness, temperance. <lb/>
Is it clear?"</p>
<p>"Crystal."</p>
<p>"<smcap>Third Degree:</smcap> <i>Spiritual Salvation</i>. 1. <lb/>
Spiritual&#x2014;Faith, wisdom, power, purity, un- <lb/>
derstanding, health, love. You see how search- <lb/>
ingly and co-ordinately interdependent and <lb/>
anthropomorphous it all is. In this Third <lb/>
Degree, as we know by the revelations of <lb/>
Christian Science, mortal mind disappears."</p>
<p>"Not earlier?"</p>
<p>"No, not until the teaching and preparation <lb/>
for the Third Degree are completed."</p>
<p>"It is not until then that one is enabled to <lb/>
take hold of Christian Science effectively, and <lb/>
with the right sense of sympathy and kinship, <lb/>
as I understand you. That is to say, it could <lb/>
not succeed during the processes of the Second <lb/>
<pb n="16"/>
Degree, because there would still be remains of <lb/>
mind left; and therefore&#x2014;but I interrupted <lb/>
you. You were about to further explain the <lb/>
good results proceeding from the erosions and <lb/>
disintegrations effected by the Third Degree. <lb/>
It is very interesting; go on, please."</p>
<p>"Yes, as I was saying, in this Third Degree <lb/>
mortal mind disappears. Science so reverses <lb/>
the evidence before the corporeal human senses <lb/>
as to make this scriptural testimony true in our <lb/>
hearts, 'the last shall be first and the first shall <lb/>
be last,' that God and His idea may be to us&#x2014; <lb/>
what divinity really is, and must of necessity <lb/>
be&#x2014;all-inclusive."</p>
<p>"It is beautiful. And with what exhaust- <lb/>
ive exactness your choice and arrangement of <lb/>
words confirm and establish what you have <lb/>
claimed for the powers and functions of the <lb/>
Third Degree. The Second could probably <lb/>
produce only temporary absence of mind; it is <lb/>
reserved to the Third to make it permanent. A <lb/>
sentence framed under the auspices of the Sec- <lb/>
ond could have a kind of meaning&#x2014;a sort of <lb/>
deceptive semblance of it&#x2014;whereas it is only <lb/>
under the magic of the Third that that defect <lb/>
<pb n="17"/>
would disappear. Also, without doubt, it is <lb/>
the Third Degree that contributes another re- <lb/>
markable specialty to Christian Science&#x2014;viz., <lb/>
ease and flow and lavishness of words, and <lb/>
rhythm and swing and smoothness. There <lb/>
must be a special reason for this?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;God - all, all - God, good God, non- <lb/>
Matter, Matteration, Spirit, Bones, Truth."</p>
<p>"That explains it."</p>
<p>"There is nothing in Christian Science that <lb/>
is not explicable; for God is one, Time is one, <lb/>
Individuality is one, and may be one of a series, <lb/>
one of many, as an individual man, individual <lb/>
horse; whereas God is one, not one of a series, <lb/>
but one alone and without an equal."</p>
<p>"These are noble thoughts. They make one <lb/>
burn to know more. How does Christian <lb/>
Science explain the spiritual relation of sys- <lb/>
tematic duality to incidental deflection?"</p>
<p>"Christian Science reverses the seeming rela- <lb/>
tion of Soul and body&#x2014;as astronomy reverses <lb/>
the human perception of the movement of the <lb/>
solar system&#x2014;and makes body tributary to the <lb/>
Mind. As it is the earth which is in motion, <lb/>
while the sun is at rest, though in viewing the <lb/>
<pb n="18"/>
sun rise one finds it impossible to believe the <lb/>
sun not to be really rising, so the body is but the <lb/>
humble servant of the restful Mind, though it <lb/>
seems otherwise to finite sense; but we shall <lb/>
never understand this while we admit that soul <lb/>
is in body, or mind in matter, and that man is <lb/>
included in non-intelligence. Soul is God, un- <lb/>
changeable and eternal; and man coexists with <lb/>
and reflects Soul, for the All-in-all is the Alto- <lb/>
gether, and the Altogether embraces the All- <lb/>
one, Soul-Mind, Mind-Soul, Love, Spirit, Bones, <lb/>
Liver, one of a series, alone and without an <lb/>
equal."</p>
<p>"What is the origin of Christian Science? Is <lb/>
it a gift of God, or did it just happen?"</p>
<p>"In a sense, it is a gift of God. That is to say, <lb/>
its powers are from Him, but the credit of the <lb/>
discovery of the powers and what they are for <lb/>
is due to an American lady."</p>
<p>"Indeed? When did this occur?"</p>
<p>"In 1866. That is the immortal date when <lb/>
pain and disease and death disappeared from <lb/>
the earth to return no more forever. That is, <lb/>
the fancies for which those terms stand dis- <lb/>
appeared. The things themselves had never <lb/>
<pb n="19"/>
existed; therefore, as soon as it was perceived <lb/>
that there were no such things, they were ea- <lb/>
sily banished. The history and nature of the <lb/>
great discovery are set down in the book here, <lb/>
and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Did the lady write the book?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she wrote it all, herself. The title is <lb/>
<i>Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures</i>&#x2014; <lb/>
for she explains the Scriptures; they were not <lb/>
understood before. Not even by the twelve Dis- <lb/>
ciples. She begins thus&#x2014;I will read it to you."</p>
<p>But she had forgotten to bring her glasses.</p>
<p>"Well, it is no matter," she said. "I remem- <lb/>
ber the words&#x2014;indeed, all Christian Scientists <lb/>
know the book by heart; it is necessary in our <lb/>
practice. We should otherwise make mistakes <lb/>
and do harm. She begins thus: 'In the year <lb/>
1866 I discovered the Science of Metaphysical <lb/>
Healing, and named it Christian Science.' And <lb/>
she says&#x2014;quite beautifully, I think&#x2014;'Through <lb/>
Christian Science, religion and medicine are in- <lb/>
spired with a diviner nature and essence, fresh <lb/>
pinions are given to faith and understanding, <lb/>
and thoughts acquaint themselves intelligently <lb/>
with God.' Her very words."</p>
<pb n="20"/>
<p>"It is elegant. And it is a fine thought, too <lb/>
&#x2014;marrying religion to medicine, instead of <lb/>
medicine to the undertaker in the old way; for <lb/>
religion and medicine properly belong to- <lb/>
gether, they being the basis of all spiritual <lb/>
and physical health. What kind of medicine <lb/>
do you give for the ordinary diseases, such <lb/>
as&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"We never give medicine in <i>any</i> circum- <lb/>
stances whatever! We&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But, madam, it <i>says</i>&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I don't care what it says, and I don't wish <lb/>
to talk about it."</p>
<p>"I am sorry if I have offended, but you see <lb/>
the mention seemed in some way inconsistent, <lb/>
and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"There <i>are</i> no inconsistencies in Christian <lb/>
Science. The thing is impossible, for the Sci- <lb/>
ence is absolute. It cannot be otherwise, since <lb/>
it proceeds directly from the All-in-all and the <lb/>
Everything-in-Which, also Soul, Bones, Truth, <lb/>
one of a series, alone and without equal. It is <lb/>
Mathematics purified from material dross and <lb/>
made spiritual."</p>
<p>"I can see that, but&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="21"/>
<p>"It rests upon the immovable basis of an <lb/>
Apodictical Principle."</p>
<p>The word flattened itself against my mind in <lb/>
trying to get in, and disordered me a little, and <lb/>
before I could inquire into its pertinency, she <lb/>
was already throwing the needed light:</p>
<p>"This Apodictical Principle is the absolute <lb/>
Principle of Scientific Mind - healing, the sov- <lb/>
ereign Omnipotence which delivers the children <lb/>
of men from pain, disease, decay, and every ill <lb/>
that flesh is heir to."</p>
<p>"Surely not every ill, every decay?"</p>
<p>"Every one; there are no exceptions; there <lb/>
is no such thing as decay&#x2014;it is an unreality, it <lb/>
has no existence."</p>
<p>"But without your glasses your failing eye- <lb/>
sight does not permit you to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"My eyesight cannot fail; nothing can fail; <lb/>
the Mind is master, and the Mind permits no <lb/>
retrogression."</p>
<p>She was under the inspiration of the Third <lb/>
Degree, therefore there could be no profit in <lb/>
continuing this part of the subject. I shifted <lb/>
to other ground and inquired further concern- <lb/>
ing the Discoverer of the Science.</p>
<pb n="22"/>
<p>"Did the discovery come suddenly, like <lb/>
Klondike, or after long study and calculation, <lb/>
like America?"</p>
<p>"The comparisons are not respectful, since <lb/>
they refer to trivialities&#x2014;but let it pass. I will <lb/>
answer in the Discoverer's own words: 'God <lb/>
had been graciously fitting me, during many <lb/>
years, for the reception of a final revelation <lb/>
of the absolute Principle of Scientific Mind- <lb/>
healing."</p>
<p>"Many years. How many?"</p>
<p>"Eighteen centuries!"</p>
<p>"All - God, God - good, good - God, Truth, <lb/>
Bones, Liver, one of a series, alone and without <lb/>
equal&#x2014;it is amazing!"</p>
<p>"You may well say it, sir. Yet it is but the <lb/>
truth. This American lady, our revered and <lb/>
sacred Founder, is distinctly referred to, and her <lb/>
coming prophesied, in the twelfth chapter of <lb/>
the Apocalypse; she could not have been more <lb/>
plainly indicated by St. John without actually <lb/>
mentioning her name."</p>
<p>"How strange, how wonderful!"</p>
<p>"I will quote her own words, from her <i>Key <lb/>
to the Scriptures:</i> 'The twelfth chapter of the <lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
Apocalypse <i>has a special suggestiveness in con- <lb/>
nection with this nineteenth century</i>.' There&#x2014; <lb/>
do you note that? Think&#x2014;note it well."</p>
<p>"But&#x2014;what does it mean?"</p>
<p>"Listen, and you will know. I quote her <lb/>
inspired words again: 'In the opening of the <lb/>
Sixth Seal, typical of six thousand years since <lb/>
Adam, there is one distinctive feature <i>which has <lb/>
special reference to the present age</i>. Thus:</p>
<p>"'Revelation xii. 1. And there appeared a <lb/>
great wonder in heaven&#x2014;a <i>woman</i> clothed with <lb/>
the sun, and the moon under her feet, and <lb/>
upon her head a crown of twelve stars.'</p>
<p>"That is our Head, our Chief, our Discoverer <lb/>
of Christian Science&#x2014;nothing can be plainer, <lb/>
nothing surer. And note this:</p>
<p>"'Revelation xii. 6. And the woman fled <lb/>
into the wilderness, where she had a place <lb/>
prepared of God.'</p>
<p>"That is Boston. I recognize it, madam. <lb/>
These are sublime things, and impressive; I <lb/>
<pb n="24"/>
never understood these passages before; please <lb/>
go on with the&#x2014;with the&#x2014;proofs."</p>
<p>"Very well. Listen:</p>
<p>"'And I saw another mighty angel come <lb/>
down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and <lb/>
a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was <lb/>
as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of <lb/>
fire. And he held in his hand <i>a little book</i>.'</p>
<p>"A little book, merely a little book&#x2014;could <lb/>
words be modester? Yet how stupendous its <lb/>
importance! Do you know what book that <lb/>
was?"</p>
<p>"Was it&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I hold it in my hand&#x2014;Christian Science!"</p>
<p>"Love, Livers, Lights, Bones, Truth, Kid- <lb/>
neys, one of a series, alone and without equal&#x2014; <lb/>
it is beyond imagination for wonder!"</p>
<p>"Hear our Founder's eloquent words: 'Then <lb/>
will a voice from harmony cry, "Go and take <lb/>
the little book: take it and eat it up, and it shall <lb/>
make thy belly bitter; but it shall be in thy <lb/>
mouth sweet as honey." Mortal, obey the heav- <lb/>
enly evangel. Take up Divine Science. Read <lb/>
<pb n="25"/>
it from beginning to end. Study it, ponder it. <lb/>
It will be, indeed, sweet at its first taste, when <lb/>
it heals you; but murmur not over Truth, if you <lb/>
find its digestion bitter.' You now know the <lb/>
history of our dear and holy Science, sir, and <lb/>
that its <i>origin</i> is not of this earth, but only its <lb/>
<i>discovery</i>. I will leave the book with you and <lb/>
will go, now; but give yourself no uneasiness&#x2014; <lb/>
I will give you absent treatment from now till I <lb/>
go to bed."</p>

<head><b><smcap>chapter iii</smcap></b></head>
<p><smcap>Under</smcap> the powerful influence of the near <lb/>
treatment and the absent treatment together, <lb/>
my bones were gradually retreating inward and <lb/>
disappearing from view. The good work took <lb/>
a brisk start, now, and went on swiftly. My <lb/>
body was diligently straining and stretching, <lb/>
this way and that, to accommodate the proc- <lb/>
esses of restoration, and every minute or two <lb/>
I heard a dull click inside and knew that the <lb/>
two ends of a fracture had been successfully <lb/>
joined. This muffled clicking and gritting and <lb/>
grinding and rasping continued during the next <lb/>
three hours, and then stopped&#x2014;the connections <lb/>
had all been made. All except dislocations; <lb/>
there were only seven of these: hips, shoulders, <lb/>
knees, neck; so that was soon over; one after <lb/>
another they slipped into their sockets with a <lb/>
sound like pulling a distant cork, and I jumped <lb/>
up as good as new, as to framework, and sent <lb/>
for the horse-doctor.</p>
<pb n="27"/>
<p>I was obliged to do this because I had a stom- <lb/>
ach-ache and a cold in the head, and I was not <lb/>
willing to trust these things any longer in the <lb/>
hands of a woman whom I did not know, and <lb/>
in whose ability to successfully treat mere dis- <lb/>
ease I had lost all confidence. My position was <lb/>
justified by the fact that the cold and the ache <lb/>
had been in her charge from the first, along <lb/>
with the fractures, but had experienced not a <lb/>
shade of relief; and, indeed, the ache was even <lb/>
growing worse and worse, and more and more <lb/>
bitter, now, probably on account of the pro- <lb/>
tracted abstention from food and drink.</p>
<p>The horse-doctor came, a pleasant man and <lb/>
full of hope and professional interest in the <lb/>
case. In the matter of smell he was pretty aro- <lb/>
matic&#x2014;in fact, quite horsy&#x2014;and I tried to ar- <lb/>
range with him for absent treatment, but it <lb/>
was not in his line, so, out of delicacy, I did not <lb/>
press it. He looked at my teeth and examined <lb/>
my hock, and said my age and general condition <lb/>
were favorable to energetic measures; there- <lb/>
fore he would give me something to turn the <lb/>
stomach-ache into the botts and the cold in the <lb/>
head into the blind staggers; then he should <lb/>
<pb n="28"/>
be on his own beat and would know what to do. <lb/>
He made up a bucket of bran-mash, and said a <lb/>
dipperful of it every two hours, alternated with <lb/>
a drench with turpentine and axle-grease in it, <lb/>
would either knock my ailments out of me in <lb/>
twenty-four hours, or so interest me in other <lb/>
ways as to make me forget they were on the <lb/>
premises. He administered my first dose him- <lb/>
self, then took his leave, saying I was free to <lb/>
eat and drink anything I pleased and in any <lb/>
quantity I liked. But I was not hungry any <lb/>
more, and did not care for food.</p>
<p>I took up the Christian Science book and <lb/>
read half of it, then took a dipperful of drench <lb/>
and read the other half. The resulting experi- <lb/>
ences were full of interest and adventure. All <lb/>
through the rumblings and grindings and quak- <lb/>
ings and effervescings accompanying the evolu- <lb/>
tion of the ache into the botts and the cold into <lb/>
the blind staggers I could note the generous <lb/>
struggle for mastery going on between the mash <lb/>
and the drench and the literature; and often I <lb/>
could tell which was ahead, and could easily dis- <lb/>
tinguish the literature from the others when <lb/>
the others were separate, though not when <lb/>
<pb n="29"/>
they were mixed; for when a bran-mash and an <lb/>
eclectic drench are mixed together they look <lb/>
just like the Apodictical Principle out on a lark, <lb/>
and no one can tell it from that. The finish <lb/>
was reached at last, the evolutions were com- <lb/>
plete, and a fine success, but I think that this <lb/>
result could have been achieved with fewer <lb/>
materials. I believe the mash was necessary to <lb/>
the conversion of the stomach-ache into the <lb/>
botts, but I think one could develop the blind <lb/>
staggers out of the literature by itself; also, that <lb/>
blind staggers produced in this way would be of <lb/>
a better quality and more lasting than any pro- <lb/>
duced by the artificial processes of the horse- <lb/>
doctor.</p>
<p>For of all the strange and frantic and incom- <lb/>
prehensible and uninterpretable books which <lb/>
the imagination of man has created, surely this <lb/>
one is the prize sample. It is written with a <lb/>
limitless confidence and complacency, and with <lb/>
a dash and stir and earnestness which often <lb/>
compel the effects of eloquence, even when the <lb/>
words do not seem to have any traceable mean- <lb/>
ing. There are plenty of people who imagine <lb/>
they understand the book; I know this, for I <lb/>
<pb n="30"/>
have talked with them; but in all cases they <lb/>
were people who also imagined that there were <lb/>
no such things as pain, sickness, and death, and <lb/>
no realities in the world; nothing actually ex- <lb/>
istent but Mind. It seems to me to modify the <lb/>
value of their testimony. When these people <lb/>
talk about Christian Science they do as Mrs. <lb/>
Fuller did: they do not use their own language, <lb/>
but the book's; they pour out the book's showy <lb/>
incoherences, and leave you to find out later <lb/>
that they were not originating, but merely <lb/>
quoting; they seem to know the volume by <lb/>
heart, and to revere it as they would a Bible&#x2014; <lb/>
another Bible, perhaps I ought to say. Plainly <lb/>
the book was written under the mental desola- <lb/>
tions of the Third Degree, and I feel sure that <lb/>
none but the membership of that Degree can <lb/>
discover meanings in it. When you read it you <lb/>
seem to be listening to a lively and aggressive <lb/>
and oracular speech delivered in an unknown <lb/>
tongue, a speech whose spirit you get but not <lb/>
the particulars; or, to change the figure, you <lb/>
seem to be listening to a vigorous instrument <lb/>
which is making a noise which it thinks is a <lb/>
tune, but which, to persons not members of the <lb/>
<pb n="31"/>
band, is only the martial tooting of a trombone, <lb/>
and merely stirs the soul through the noise, but <lb/>
does not convey a meaning.</p>
<p>The book's serenities of self-satisfaction do <lb/>
almost seem to smack of a heavenly origin&#x2014; <lb/>
they have no blood-kin in the earth. It is <lb/>
more than human to be so placidly certain <lb/>
about things, and so finely superior, and so <lb/>
airily content with one's performance. With- <lb/>
out ever presenting anything which may right- <lb/>
fully be called by the strong name of Evidence, <lb/>
and sometimes without even <i>mentioning</i> a rea- <lb/>
son for a deduction at all, it thunders out the <lb/>
startling words, "I have <i>Proved</i>" so and so. It <lb/>
takes the Pope and all the great guns of his <lb/>
Church in battery assembled to authoritatively <lb/>
settle and establish the meaning of a sole and <lb/>
single unclarified passage of Scripture, and this <lb/>
at vast cost of time and study and reflection, <lb/>
but the author of this work is superior to all <lb/>
that: she finds the whole Bible in an unclarified <lb/>
condition, and at small expense of time and no <lb/>
expense of mental effort she clarifies it from lid <lb/>
to lid, reorganizes and improves the meanings, <lb/>
then authoritatively settles and establishes <lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
them with formulas which you cannot tell from <lb/>
"Let there be light!" and "Here you have it!" <lb/>
It is the first time since the dawn-days of Crea- <lb/>
tion that a Voice has gone crashing through <lb/>
space with such placid and complacent con- <lb/>
fidence and command.<ref target="n1"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>January</i>, 1903. The first reading of any book whose <lb/>
terminology is new and strange is nearly sure to leave the <lb/>
reader in a bewildered and sarcastic state of mind. But <lb/>
now that, during the past two months, I have, by diligence, <lb/>
gained a fair acquaintanceship with <i>Science and Health</i> <lb/>
technicalities, I no longer find the bulk of that work hard <lb/>
to understand.&#x2014;M. T.</p>
<p><i>P. S.</i> The wisdom harvested from the foregoing <lb/>
thoughts has already done me a service and saved me a <lb/>
sorrow. Nearly a month ago there came to me from one <lb/>
of the universities a tract by Dr. Edward Anthony Spitz- <lb/>
ka on the "Encephalic Anatomy of the Races." I judged <lb/>
that my opinion was desired by the university, and I was <lb/>
greatly pleased with this attention and wrote and said I <lb/>
would furnish it as soon as I could. That night I put my <lb/>
plodding and disheartening Christian Science mining aside <lb/>
and took hold of the matter. I wrote an eager chapter, and <lb/>
was expecting to finish my opinion the next day, but was <lb/>
called away for a week, and my mind was soon charged <lb/>
with other interests. It was not until to-day, after the <lb/>
lapse of nearly a month, that I happened upon my En- <lb/>
cephalic chapter again. Meantime, the new wisdom had <lb/>
come to me, and I read it with shame. I recognized that <lb/>
I had entered upon that work in far from the right temper <lb/>
&#x2014;far from the respectful and judicial spirit which was its <lb/>
due of reverence. I had begun upon it with the following <lb/>
paragraph for fuel: <lb/>
<q>"<smcap>Fissures of the Parietal and Occipital Lobes (Lat- <lb/>
eral Surface)</smcap>.&#x2014;<i>The Postcentral Fissural Complex</i>.&#x2014;In this <lb/>
hemicerebrum, the postcentral and subcentral are combined to <lb/>
form a continuous fissure, attaining a length of 8.5 cm. Dor- <lb/>
sally, the fissure bifurcates, embracing the gyre indented by the <lb/>
caudal limb of the paracentral. The caudal limb of the post- <lb/>
central is joined by a transparietal piece. In all, five additional <lb/>
rami spring from the combined fissure. A vadum separates it <lb/>
from the parietal; another from the central."</q></p>
<p>It humiliates me, now, to see how angry I got over that; <lb/>
and how scornful. I said that the style was disgraceful; <lb/>
that it was labored and tumultuous, and in places violent, <lb/>
that the treatment was involved and erratic, and almost, <lb/>
as a rule, bewildering; that to lack of simplicity was <lb/>
added a lack of vocabulary; that there was quite too much <lb/>
feeling shown; that if I had a dog that would get so ex- <lb/>
cited and incoherent over a tranquil subject like En- <lb/>
cephalic Anatomy I would not pay his tax; and at that <lb/>
point I got excited myself and spoke bitterly of these <lb/>
mongrel insanities, and said a person might as well try to <lb/>
understand <i>Science and Health</i>.</p>
<p>I know, now, where the trouble was, and am glad of the <lb/>
interruption that saved me from sending my verdict to <lb/>
the university. It makes me cold to think what those <lb/>
people might have thought of me.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></p>

<p><smcap>No</smcap> one doubts&#x2014;certainly not I&#x2014;that the <lb/>
mind exercises a powerful influence over the <lb/>
body. From the beginning of time, the sorcerer, <lb/>
the interpreter of dreams, the fortune-teller, the <lb/>
charlatan, the quack, the wild medicine-man, <lb/>
the educated physician, the mesmerist, and the <lb/>
hypnotist have made use of the client's <i>imagi- <lb/>
nation</i> to help them in their work. They have <lb/>
all recognized the potency and availability of <lb/>
that force. Physicians cure many patients <lb/>
with a bread pill; they know that where the dis- <lb/>
ease is only a fancy, the patient's confidence in <lb/>
the doctor will make the bread pill effective.</p>
<p><i>Faith in the doctor</i>. Perhaps that is the en- <lb/>
tire thing. It seems to look like it. In old times <lb/>
the King cured the king's evil by the touch of <lb/>
the royal hand. He frequently made extraor- <lb/>
dinary cures. Could his footman have done it? <lb/>
No&#x2014;not in his own clothes. Disguised as the <lb/>
King, could he have done it? I think we may <lb/>
<pb n="35"/>
not doubt it. I think we may feel sure that <lb/>
it was not the King's touch that made the cure <lb/>
in any instance, but the patient's faith in the <lb/>
efficacy of a King's touch. Genuine and re- <lb/>
markable cures have been achieved through <lb/>
contact with the relics of a saint. Is it not <lb/>
likely that any other bones would have done as <lb/>
well if the substitution had been concealed <lb/>
from the patient? When I was a boy a farm- <lb/>
er's wife who lived five miles from our village <lb/>
had great fame as a faith-doctor&#x2014;that was <lb/>
what she called herself. Sufferers came to her <lb/>
from all around, and she laid her hand upon <lb/>
them and said, "Have faith&#x2014;it is all that is <lb/>
necessary," and they went away well of their <lb/>
ailments. She was not a religious woman, and <lb/>
pretended to no occult powers. She said that <lb/>
the patient's faith in her did the work. Sev- <lb/>
eral times I saw her make immediate cures of <lb/>
severe toothaches. My mother was the pa- <lb/>
tient. In Austria there is a peasant who drives <lb/>
a great trade in this sort of industry, and has <lb/>
both the high and the low for patients. He <lb/>
gets into prison every now and then for prac- <lb/>
tising without a diploma, but his business is as <lb/>
<pb n="36"/>
brisk as ever when he gets out, for his work is <lb/>
unquestionably successful and keeps his repu- <lb/>
tation high. In Bavaria there is a man who <lb/>
performed so many great cures that he had to <lb/>
retire from his profession of stage-carpentering <lb/>
in order to meet the demand of his constantly <lb/>
increasing body of customers. He goes on <lb/>
from year to year doing his miracles, and has <lb/>
become very rich. He pretends to no religious <lb/>
helps, no supernatural aids, but thinks there is <lb/>
something in his make-up which inspires the <lb/>
confidence of his patients, and that it is this <lb/>
confidence which does the work, and not some <lb/>
mysterious power issuing from himself.<ref target="n2"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n2" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>January</i>, 1903. I have personal and intimate knowl- <lb/>
edge of the "miraculous" cure of a case of paralysis which <lb/>
had kept the patient helpless in bed during two years, in <lb/>
spite of all that the best medical science of New York <lb/>
could do. The travelling "quack" (that is what they <lb/>
called him), came on two successive mornings and lifted <lb/>
the patient out of bed and said "Walk!" and the patient <lb/>
walked. That was the end of it. It was forty-one years <lb/>
ago. The patient has walked ever since.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></p>
<p>Within the last quarter of a century, in <lb/>
America, several sects of curers have appeared <lb/>
under various names and have done notable <lb/>
things in the way of healing ailments without <lb/>
<pb n="37"/>
the use of medicines. There are the Mind Cure, <lb/>
the Faith Cure, the Prayer Cure, the Mental- <lb/>
Science Cure, and the Christian-Science Cure; <lb/>
and apparently they all do their miracles with <lb/>
the same old, powerful instrument&#x2014;<i>the pa- <lb/>
tient's imagination</i>. Differing names, but no <lb/>
difference in the process. But they do not <lb/>
give that instrument the credit; each sect <lb/>
claims that its way differs from the ways of the <lb/>
others.</p>
<p>They all achieve some cures, there is no <lb/>
question about it; and the Faith Cure and the <lb/>
Prayer Cure probably do no harm when they <lb/>
do no good, since they do not forbid the pa- <lb/>
tient to help out the cure with medicines if he <lb/>
wants to; but the others bar medicines, and <lb/>
claim ability to cure every conceivable human <lb/>
ailment through the application of their men- <lb/>
tal forces alone. There would seem to be an <lb/>
element of danger here. It has the look of <lb/>
claiming too much, I think. Public confi- <lb/>
dence would probably be increased if less were <lb/>
claimed.<ref target="n3"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n3" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>February</i>, 1903. I find that Christian Science claims <lb/>

<p>The Christian Scientist was not able to cure <lb/>
my stomach-ache and my cold; but the horse- <lb/>
doctor did it. This convinces me that Chris- <lb/>
tian Science claims too much. In my opinion <lb/>
it ought to let diseases alone and confine itself <lb/>
to surgery. There it would have everything <lb/>
its own way.</p>
<p>The horse-doctor charged me thirty kreutzers, <lb/>
and I paid him; in fact, I doubled it and gave <lb/>
him a shilling. Mrs. Fuller brought in an <lb/>
itemized bill for a crate of broken bones mend- <lb/>
ed in two hundred and thirty-four places&#x2014;one <lb/>
dollar per fracture.</p>
<p>"Nothing exists but Mind?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," she answered. "All else is sub- <lb/>
stanceless, all else is imaginary."</p>
<p>I gave her an imaginary check, and now she <lb/>
is suing me for substantial dollars. It looks <lb/>
inconsistent.</p>

<p><smcap>Let</smcap> us consider that we are all partially in- <lb/>

unriddle many riddles; it will make clear and <lb/>
simple many things which are involved in <lb/>
haunting and harassing difficulties and ob- <lb/>
scurities now.</p>
<p>Those of us who are not in the asylum, and <lb/>
not demonstrably due there, are nevertheless, <lb/>
no doubt, insane in one or two particulars. I <lb/>
think we must admit this; but I think that we <lb/>
are otherwise healthy - minded. I think that <lb/>
when we all see one thing alike, it is evidence <lb/>
that, as regards that one thing, our minds are <lb/>
perfectly sound. Now there are really several <lb/>
things which we do all see alike; things which <lb/>
we all accept, and about which we do not dis- <lb/>
pute. For instance, we who are outside of the <lb/>
asylum all agree that water seeks its level; that <lb/>
the sun gives light and heat; that fire consumes; <lb/>
that fog is damp; that six times six are thirty- <lb/>
<pb n="40"/>
six, that two from ten leaves eight; that eight <lb/>
and seven are fifteen. These are, perhaps, the <lb/>
only things we are agreed about; but, although <lb/>
they are so few, they are of inestimable value, <lb/>
because they make an infallible standard of <lb/>
sanity. Whosoever accepts them him we know <lb/>
to be substantially sane; sufficiently sane; in <lb/>
the working essentials, sane. Whoever dis- <lb/>
putes a single one of them him we know <lb/>
to be wholly insane, and qualified for the <lb/>
asylum.</p>
<p>Very well, the man who disputes none of <lb/>
them we concede to be entitled to go at large. <lb/>
But that is concession enough. We cannot go <lb/>
any further than that; for we know that in all <lb/>
matters of mere <i>opinion</i> that same man is in- <lb/>
sane&#x2014;just as insane as we are; just as insane <lb/>
as Shakespeare was. We know exactly where <lb/>
to put our finger upon his insanity: <i>it is where <lb/>
his opinion differs from ours</i>.</p>
<p>That is a simple rule, and easy to remember. <lb/>
When I, a thoughtful and unbiassed Presbyte- <lb/>
rian, examine the Koran, I know that beyond <lb/>
any question every Mohammedan is insane; <lb/>
not in all things, but in religious matters. When <lb/>
<pb n="41"/>
a thoughtful and unbiassed Mohammedan ex- <lb/>
amines the Westminster Catechism, he knows <lb/>
that beyond any question I am spiritually in- <lb/>
sane. I cannot prove to him that he is in- <lb/>
sane, because you never can prove anything to <lb/>
a lunatic&#x2014;for that is a part of his insanity and <lb/>
the evidence of it. He cannot prove to me <lb/>
that I am insane, for my mind has the same de- <lb/>
fect that afflicts his. All Democrats are in- <lb/>
sane, but not one of them knows it; none but <lb/>
the Republicans and Mugwumps know it. All <lb/>
the Republicans are insane, but only the Dem- <lb/>
ocrats and Mugwumps can perceive it. The <lb/>
rule is perfect: <i>in all matters of opinion our ad- <lb/>
versaries are insane</i>. When I look around me, <lb/>
I am often troubled to see how many people are <lb/>
mad. To mention only a few:</p>

<p>But there's no end to the list; there are mill- <lb/>
ions of them! And all insane; each in his own <lb/>
way; insane as to his pet fad or opinion, but <lb/>
otherwise sane and rational.</p>
<p>This should move us to be charitable towards <lb/>
one another's lunacies. I recognize that in his <lb/>
special belief the Christian Scientist is insane, <lb/>
because he does not believe as I do; but I hail <lb/>
him as my mate and fellow, because I am as in- <lb/>
<pb n="43"/>
sane as he&#x2014;insane from his point of view, and <lb/>
his point of view is as authoritative as mine and <lb/>
worth as much. That is to say, worth a brass <lb/>
farthing. Upon a great religious or political <lb/>
question, the opinion of the dullest head in the <lb/>
world is worth the same as the opinion of the <lb/>
brightest head in the world&#x2014;a brass farthing. <lb/>
How do we arrive at this? It is simple. The <lb/>
affirmative opinion of a stupid man is neutral- <lb/>
ized by the negative opinion of his stupid <lb/>
neighbor&#x2014;no decision is reached; the affirma- <lb/>
tive opinion of the intellectual giant Gladstone <lb/>
is neutralized by the negative opinion of the in- <lb/>
tellectual giant Newman&#x2014;no decision is reach- <lb/>
ed. Opinions that prove nothing are, of course, <lb/>
without value&#x2014;any but a dead person knows <lb/>
that much. This obliges us to admit the truth <lb/>
of the unpalatable proposition just mentioned <lb/>
above&#x2014;that, in disputed matters political and <lb/>
religious, one man's opinion is worth no more <lb/>
than his peer's, and hence it follows that no <lb/>
man's opinion possesses any real value. It is a <lb/>
humbling thought, but there is no way to get <lb/>
around it: <i>all</i> opinions upon these great sub- <lb/>
jects are brass-farthing opinions.</p>
<pb n="44"/>
<p>It is a mere plain, simple fact&#x2014;as clear and <lb/>
as certain as that eight and seven make fif- <lb/>
teen. And by it we recognize that we are all <lb/>
insane, as concerns those matters. If we were <lb/>
sane, we should all see a political or religious <lb/>
doctrine alike; there would be no dispute: it <lb/>
would be a case of eight and seven&#x2014;just as it <lb/>
is in heaven, where all are sane and none in- <lb/>
sane. There there is but one religion, one be- <lb/>
lief; the harmony is perfect; there is never a <lb/>
discordant note.</p>
<p>Under protection of these preliminaries, I <lb/>
suppose I may now repeat without offence that <lb/>
the Christian Scientist is insane. I mean him <lb/>
no discourtesy, and I am not charging&#x2014;nor <lb/>
even imagining&#x2014;that he is insaner than the <lb/>
rest of the human race. I think he is more <lb/>
picturesquely insane than some of us. At the <lb/>
same time, I am quite sure that in one impor- <lb/>
tant and splendid particular he is much saner <lb/>
than is the vast bulk of the race.</p>
<p>Why is he insane? I told you before: it is <lb/>
because his opinions are not ours. I know of <lb/>
no other reason, and I do not need any other: <lb/>
it is the only way we <i>have</i> of discovering in- <lb/>
<pb n="45"/>
sanity when it is not violent. It is merely the <lb/>
picturesqueness of his insanity that makes it <lb/>
more interesting than my kind or yours. For <lb/>
instance, consider his "little book"; the "little <lb/>
book" exposed in the sky eighteen centuries ago <lb/>
by the flaming angel of the Apocalypse, and <lb/>
handed down in our day to Mrs. Mary Baker G. <lb/>
Eddy, of New Hampshire, and translated by <lb/>
her, word for word, into English (with help of <lb/>
a polisher), and now published and distributed <lb/>
in hundreds of editions by her at a clear profit <lb/>
per volume, above cost, of seven hundred per <lb/>
cent.!<ref target="n4"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n4" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>February</i>, 1903. This has been disputed by novices. <lb/>

frequently calls by just that name, and always <lb/>
enclosed in quotation-marks to keep its high or- <lb/>
igin exultantly in mind; a "little book" which <lb/>
"explains" and reconstructs and new - paints <lb/>
and decorates the Bible, and puts a mansard <lb/>
<pb n="46"/>

modern improvements; a "little book" which <lb/>
for the present affects to travel in yoke with <lb/>
the Bible and be friendly to it, and within half <lb/>
a century will hitch the Bible in the rear and <lb/>
thenceforth travel tandem, itself in the lead, <lb/>
in the coming great march of Christian Scien- <lb/>
tism through the Protestant dominions of the <lb/>
planet.</p>

what is going to pour into the treasure-chest of <lb/>
the Christian-Scientist Papacy by-and-by, let <lb/>
us not doubt it. We will examine the financial <lb/>
outlook presently and see what it promises. A <lb/>
favorite subject of the new Old Master will be <lb/>
the first verse of the twelfth chapter of Reve- <lb/>
lation&#x2014;a verse which Mrs. Eddy says (in her <lb/>
Annex to the Scriptures) has "one distinctive <lb/>
feature which has special reference to the pres- <lb/>
ent age"&#x2014;and to <i>her</i>, as is rather pointedly <lb/>
indicated:</p>
<p>"And there appeared a great wonder in <lb/>
heaven; a <i>woman</i> clothed with the sun, and <lb/>

<p>Is it insanity to believe that Christian Scien- <lb/>

show that any new religion has made in the <lb/>
world since the birth and spread of Moham- <lb/>
medanism, and that within a century from <lb/>
now it may stand second to Rome only, in num- <lb/>
bers and power in Christendom?</p>
<p>If this is a wild dream it will not be easy to <lb/>
prove it so just yet, I think. There seems <lb/>
argument that it may come true. The Chris- <lb/>
tian-Science "boom," proper, is not yet five <lb/>
years old; yet already it has two hundred and <lb/>
fifty churches.<ref target="n7"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n7" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>February</i>, 1903. Through misinformation I doubled <lb/>

<p>It has its start, you see, and it is a phenom- <lb/>
enally good one. Moreover, it is latterly spread- <lb/>
ing with a constantly accelerating swiftness. <lb/>
It has a better chance to grow and prosper and <lb/>
achieve permanency than any other existing <lb/>
"ism"; for it has <i>more to offer</i> than any other <lb/>
The past teaches us that in order to succeed, a <lb/>
<pb n="50"/>
movement like this must not be a mere philos- <lb/>
ophy, it must be a religion; also, that it must <lb/>
not claim entire originality, but content itself <lb/>
with passing for an improvement on an <i>exist- <lb/>
ing</i> religion, and show its hand later, when <lb/>
strong and prosperous&#x2014;like Mohammedanism.</p>
<p>Next, there must be money&#x2014;and plenty <lb/>
of it.</p>
<p>Next, the power and authority and capital <lb/>
must be concentrated in the grip of a small and <lb/>
irresponsible clique, with nobody outside priv- <lb/>
ileged to ask questions or find fault.</p>
<p>Next, as before remarked, it must bait its <lb/>
hook with some new and attractive advan- <lb/>
tages over the baits offered by its compet- <lb/>
itors.</p>
<p>A new movement equipped with some of <lb/>
these endowments&#x2014;like spiritualism, for in- <lb/>
stance&#x2014;may count upon a considerable suc- <lb/>
cess; a new movement equipped with the bulk <lb/>
of them&#x2014;like Mohammedanism, for instance&#x2014; <lb/>
may count upon a widely extended conquest. <lb/>
Mormonism had all the requisites but one&#x2014;it <lb/>
had nothing new and nothing valuable to bait <lb/>
with. Spiritualism lacked the important de- <lb/>
<pb n="51"/>
tail of concentration of money and authority <lb/>
in the hands of an irresponsible clique.</p>
<p>The above equipment is excellent, admirable, <lb/>
powerful, but not perfect. There is yet an- <lb/>
other detail which is worth the whole of it put <lb/>
together&#x2014;and more; a detail which has never <lb/>
been joined (in the <i>beginning</i> of a religious <lb/>
movement) to a supremely good working equip- <lb/>
ment since the world began, until now: <i>a new <lb/>
personage to worship</i>.<ref target="n8"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n8" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>That</i> has been disputed by a Christian-Science friend. <lb/>
This surprises me. I will examine this detail in the new <lb/>
half of the book.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> Christianity had the <lb/>
Saviour, but at first and for generations it lack- <lb/>
ed money and concentrated power. In Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy, Christian Science possesses the new per- <lb/>
sonage for worship, and in addition&#x2014;here in <lb/>
the very beginning&#x2014;a working equipment that <lb/>
has not a flaw in it. In the beginning, Mo- <lb/>
hammedanism had no money; and it has never <lb/>
had anything to offer its client but heaven&#x2014; <lb/>
nothing here below that was valuable. In ad- <lb/>
dition to heaven hereafter, Christian Science <lb/>
has <i>present health and a cheerful spirit</i> to offer; <lb/>
and in comparison with this bribe all other this- <lb/>
<pb n="52"/>
world bribes are poor and cheap. You recognize <lb/>
that this estimate is admissible, do you not?</p>
<p>To whom does Bellamy's "Nationalism" ap- <lb/>
peal? Necessarily to the few: people who read <lb/>
and dream, and are compassionate, and troubled <lb/>
for the poor and the hard-driven. To whom <lb/>
does Spiritualism appeal? Necessarily to the <lb/>
few; its "boom" has lasted for half a century, <lb/>
and I believe it claims short of four millions of <lb/>
adherents in America. Who are attracted by <lb/>
Swedenborgianism and some of the other fine <lb/>
and delicate "isms"? The few again: educated <lb/>
people, sensitively organized, with superior <lb/>
mental endowments, who seek lofty planes of <lb/>
thought and find their contentment there. And <lb/>
who are attracted by Christian Science? There <lb/>
is no limit; its field is horizonless; its appeal is as <lb/>
universal as is the appeal of Christianity itself. <lb/>
It appeals to the rich, the poor, the high, the <lb/>
low, the cultured, the ignorant, the gifted, the <lb/>
stupid, the modest, the vain, the wise, the silly, <lb/>
the soldier, the civilian, the hero, the coward, <lb/>
the idler, the worker, the godly, the godless, the <lb/>
freeman, the slave, the adult, the child; <i>they <lb/>
who are ailing in body or mind, they who have</i> <lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
<i>friends that are ailing in body or mind</i>. To mass <lb/>
it in a phrase, its clientage is the Human Race. <lb/>
Will it march? I think so.</p>
<p>Remember its principal great offer: to <i>rid the <lb/>
Race of pain and disease</i>. Can it do so? In <lb/>
large measure, yes. How much of the pain <lb/>
and disease in the world is created by the imag- <lb/>
inations of the sufferers, and then kept alive by <lb/>
those same imaginations? Four-fifths? Not <lb/>
anything short of that, I should think. Can <lb/>
Christian Science banish that four-fifths? I <lb/>
think so. Can any other (organized) force do <lb/>
it? None that I know of. Would this be a <lb/>
new world when that was accomplished? And <lb/>
a pleasanter one&#x2014;for us well people, as well as <lb/>
for those fussy and fretting sick ones? Would <lb/>
it seem as if there was not as much gloomy <lb/>
weather as there used to be? I think so.</p>
<p>In the mean time, would the Scientist kill off <lb/>
a good many patients? I think so. More than <lb/>
get killed off now by the legalized methods? I <lb/>
will take up that question presently.</p>
<p>At present, I wish to ask you to examine <lb/>
some of the Scientist's performances, as regis- <lb/>
tered in his magazine, <i>The Christian Science</i> <lb/>
<pb n="54"/>
<i>Journal</i>&#x2014;October number, 1898. First, a Bap- <lb/>
tist clergyman gives us this true picture of "the <lb/>
average orthodox Christian"&#x2014;and he could <lb/>
have added that it is a true picture of the aver- <lb/>
age (civilized) human being:</p>
<p>"He is a worried and fretted and fearful <lb/>
man; afraid of himself and his propensities, <lb/>
afraid of colds and fevers, afraid of treading on <lb/>
serpents or drinking deadly things."</p>
<p>Then he gives us this contrast:</p>
<p>"The average Christian Scientist has put all <lb/>
anxiety and fretting under his feet. He does <lb/>
have a victory over fear and care that is not <lb/>
achieved by the average orthodox Christian."</p>
<p><i>He has put all anxiety and fretting under his <lb/>
feet</i>. What proportion of your earnings or in- <lb/>
come would you be willing to pay for that frame <lb/>
of mind, year in, year out? It really outvalues <lb/>
any price that can be put upon it. Where <lb/>
can you purchase it, at any outlay of any <lb/>
sort, in any Church or out of it, except the <lb/>
Scientist's?</p>
<pb n="55"/>
<p>Well, it is the anxiety and fretting about <lb/>
colds, and fevers, and draughts, and getting our <lb/>
feet wet, and about forbidden food eaten in <lb/>
terror of indigestion, that brings on the cold <lb/>
and the fever and the indigestion and the most <lb/>
of our other ailments; and so, if the Science <lb/>
can banish that anxiety from the world I think <lb/>
it can reduce the world's disease and pain about <lb/>
four-fifths.<ref target="n9"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n9" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>February</i>, 1903. In a letter to me, a distinguished <lb/>
New York physician finds fault with this notion. If four- <lb/>
fifths of our pains and diseases are not the result of un- <lb/>
wholesome fears and imaginings, the Science has a smaller <lb/>
field than I was guessing; but I still think four-fifths is a <lb/>
sound guess.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></p>
<p>In this October number many of the redeem- <lb/>
ed testify and give thanks; and not coldly, but <lb/>
with passionate gratitude. As a rule they seem <lb/>
drunk with health, and with the surprise of it, <lb/>
the wonder of it, the unspeakable glory and <lb/>
splendor of it, after a long, sober spell spent in <lb/>
inventing imaginary diseases and concreting <lb/>
them with doctor-stuff. The first witness tes- <lb/>
tifies that when "this most beautiful Truth <lb/>
first dawned on him" he had "nearly all the <lb/>
ills that flesh is heir to"; that those he did not <lb/>
<pb n="56"/>
have he thought he had&#x2014;and this made the <lb/>
tale about complete. What was the natural <lb/>
result? Why, he was a dump-pit "for all the <lb/>
doctors, druggists, and patent medicines of the <lb/>
country." Christian Science came to his help, <lb/>
and "the old sick conditions passed away," <lb/>
and along with them the "dismal forebod- <lb/>
ings" which he had been accustomed to em- <lb/>
ploy in conjuring up ailments. And so he was <lb/>
a healthy and cheerful man, now, and aston- <lb/>
ished.</p>
<p>But I am not astonished, for from other <lb/>
sources I know what must have been his meth- <lb/>
od of applying Christian Science. If I am in <lb/>
the right, he watchfully and diligently <i>diverted <lb/>
his mind from unhealthy channels and compelled <lb/>
it to travel in healthy ones</i>. Nothing contrivable <lb/>
by human invention could be more formidably <lb/>
effective than that, in banishing imaginary ail- <lb/>
ments and in closing the entrances against sub- <lb/>
sequent applicants of their breed. I think his <lb/>
method was to keep saying, "I am well! I am <lb/>
sound!&#x2014;sound and well! well and sound! Per- <lb/>
fectly sound, perfectly well! I have no pain; <lb/>
there's no such thing as pain! I have no dis- <lb/>
<pb n="57"/>
ease; there's no such thing as disease! Noth- <lb/>
ing is real but Mind; all is Mind, All-Good- <lb/>
Good-Good, Life, Soul, Liver, Bones, one of a <lb/>
series, ante and pass the buck!"</p>
<p>I do not mean that that was exactly the <lb/>
formula used, but that it doubtless contains <lb/>
the spirit of it. The Scientist would attach <lb/>
value to the <i>exact</i> formula, no doubt, and to the <lb/>
religious spirit in which it was used. I should <lb/>
think that <i>any</i> formula that would divert the <lb/>
mind from unwholesome channels and force it <lb/>
into healthy ones would answer every purpose <lb/>
with some people, though not with all. I <lb/>
think it most likely that a very religious <lb/>
man would find the addition of the relig- <lb/>
ious spirit a powerful reinforcement in his <lb/>
case.</p>
<p>The second witness testifies that the Sci- <lb/>
ence banished "an old organic trouble," which <lb/>
the doctor and the surgeon had been nurs- <lb/>
ing with drugs and the knife for seven <lb/>
years.</p>
<p>He calls it his "claim." A surface-miner <lb/>
would think it was not <i>his</i> claim at all, but the <lb/>
property of the doctor and his pal the surgeon <lb/>
<pb n="58"/>
&#x2014;for he would be misled by that word, which <lb/>
is Christian-Science slang for "ailment." The <lb/>
Christian Scientist <i>has</i> no ailment; to him there <lb/>
is no such thing, and he will not use the hateful <lb/>
word. All that happens to him is that upon <lb/>
his attention an imaginary disturbance some- <lb/>
times obtrudes itself which <i>claims</i> to be an ail- <lb/>
ment but isn't.</p>
<p>This witness offers testimony for a clergy- <lb/>
man seventy years old who had preached forty <lb/>
years in a Christian church, and has now gone <lb/>
over to the new sect. He was "almost blind <lb/>
and deaf." He was treated by the C. S. <lb/>
method, and "when he heard the voice of <lb/>
Truth he saw spiritually." Saw spiritually? <lb/>
It is a little indefinite; they had better treat <lb/>
him again. Indefinite testimonies might prop- <lb/>
erly be waste - basketed, since there is evi- <lb/>
dently no lack of definite ones procurable; <lb/>
but this C. S. magazine is poorly edited, <lb/>
and so mistakes of this kind must be ex- <lb/>
pected.</p>
<p>The next witness is a soldier of the Civil War. <lb/>
When Christian Science found him, he had in <lb/>
stock the following claims:</p>
<pb n="59"/>
<list>
<item>Indigestion,</item>
<item>Rheumatism,</item>
<item>Catarrh,</item>
<item><p>Chalky deposits in</p>
<p>Shoulder-joints,</p>
<p>Arm-joints,</p>
<p>Hand-joints,</p></item>
<item>Insomnia,</item>
<item><p>Atrophy of the muscles <lb/>
of</p>
<p>Arms,</p>
<p>Shoulders,</p></item>
<item>Stiffness of all those <lb/>
joints,</item>
<item>Excruciating pains <lb/>
most of the time.</item>
</list>
<p>These claims have a very substantial sound. <lb/>
They came of exposure in the campaigns. The <lb/>
doctors did all they could, but it was little. <lb/>
Prayers were tried, but "I never realized any <lb/>
physical relief from that source." After thirty <lb/>
years of torture, he went to a Christian Scien- <lb/>
tist and took an hour's treatment and went <lb/>
home painless. Two days later, he "began to <lb/>
eat like a well man." Then "the claims van- <lb/>
ished&#x2014;some at once, others more gradually"; <lb/>
finally, "they have almost entirely disappear- <lb/>
ed." And&#x2014;a thing which is of still greater <lb/>
value&#x2014;he is now "<i>contented and happy</i>." That <lb/>
is a detail which, as earlier remarked, is a Scien- <lb/>
tist-Church specialty. And, indeed, one may <lb/>
go further and assert with little or no exaggera- <lb/>
<pb n="60"/>
tion that it is a Christian-Science monopoly. <lb/>
With thirty-one years' effort, the Methodist <lb/>
Church had not succeeded in furnishing it to <lb/>
this harassed soldier.</p>
<p>And so the tale goes on. Witness after wit- <lb/>
ness bulletins his claims, declares their prompt <lb/>
abolishment, and gives Mrs. Eddy's Discovery <lb/>
the praise. Milk-leg is cured; nervous prostra- <lb/>
tion is cured; consumption is cured; and St. <lb/>
Vitus's dance is made a pastime. Even with- <lb/>
out a fiddle. And now and then an interesting <lb/>
new addition to the Science slang appears on <lb/>
the page. We have "demonstrations over <lb/>
chilblains" and such things. It seems to be a <lb/>
curtailed way of saying "demonstrations of the <lb/>
power of Christian-Science Truth over the fic- <lb/>
tion which masquerades under the name of Chil- <lb/>
blains." The children, as well as the adults, <lb/>
share in the blessings of the Science. "Through <lb/>
the study of the 'little book' they are learning <lb/>
how to be healthful, peaceful, and wise." Some- <lb/>
times they are cured of their little claims by the <lb/>
professional healer, and sometimes more ad- <lb/>
vanced children say over the formula and cure <lb/>
themselves.</p>
<pb n="61"/>
<p>A little Far-Western girl of nine, equipped <lb/>
with an adult vocabulary, states her age and <lb/>
says, "I thought I would write a demonstration <lb/>
to you." She had a claim, derived from getting <lb/>
flung over a pony's head and landed on a rock- <lb/>
pile. She saved herself from disaster by re- <lb/>
membering to say "God is All" while she was <lb/>
in the air. I couldn't have done it. I shouldn't <lb/>
even have thought of it. I should have been <lb/>
too excited. Nothing but Christian Science <lb/>
could have enabled that child to do that calm <lb/>
and thoughtful and judicious thing in those cir- <lb/>
cumstances. She came down on her head, and <lb/>
by all the rules she should have broken it; but <lb/>
the intervention of the formula prevented that, <lb/>
so the only claim resulting was a blackened eye. <lb/>
Monday morning it was still swollen and shut. <lb/>
At school "it hurt pretty badly&#x2014;that is, it <lb/>
<i>seemed</i> to." So "I was excused, and went <lb/>
down to the basement and said, 'Now I am <lb/>
depending on mamma instead of God, and I <lb/>
<i>will</i> depend on God instead of mamma.'" No <lb/>
doubt this would have answered; but, to make <lb/>
sure, she added Mrs. Eddy to the team and re- <lb/>
cited "the Scientific Statement of Being," <lb/>
<pb n="62"/>
which is one of the principal incantations, I <lb/>
judge. Then "I felt my eye opening." Why, <lb/>
dear, it would have opened an oyster. I think <lb/>
it is one of the touchingest things in child-his- <lb/>
tory, that pious little rat down cellar pumping <lb/>
away at the Scientific Statement of Being.</p>
<p>There is a page about another good child&#x2014; <lb/>
little Gordon. Little Gordon "came into the <lb/>
world without the assistance of surgery or an- <lb/>
&#x00E6;sthetics." He was a "demonstration." A <lb/>
painless one; therefore, his coming evoked "joy <lb/>
and thankfulness to God and the Discoverer of <lb/>
Christian Science." It is a noticeable feature <lb/>
of this literature&#x2014;the so frequent linking to- <lb/>
gether of the Two Beings in an equal bond; also <lb/>
of Their Two Bibles. When little Gordon was <lb/>
two years old, "he was playing horse on the <lb/>
bed, where I had left my 'little book.' I no- <lb/>
ticed him stop in his play, take the book care- <lb/>
fully in his little hands, kiss it softly, then look <lb/>
about for the highest place of safety his arms <lb/>
could reach, and put it there." This pious act <lb/>
filled the mother "with such a train of thought <lb/>
as I had never experienced before. I thought <lb/>
of the sweet mother of long ago who kept things <lb/>
<pb n="63"/>
in her heart," etc. It is a bold comparison; <lb/>
however, unconscious profanations are about <lb/>
as common in the mouths of the lay member- <lb/>
ship of the new Church as are frank and open <lb/>
ones in the mouths of its consecrated chiefs.</p>
<p>Some days later, the family library&#x2014;Chris- <lb/>
tian-Science books&#x2014;was lying in a deep-seated <lb/>
window. This was another chance for the holy <lb/>
child to show off. He left his play and went <lb/>
there and pushed all the books to one side, ex- <lb/>
cept the Annex. "<i>It</i> he took in both hands, <lb/>
slowly raised it to his lips, then removed it care- <lb/>
fully, and seated himself in the window." It <lb/>
had seemed to the mother too wonderful to be <lb/>
true, that first time; but now she was convinced <lb/>
that "neither imagination nor accident had <lb/>
anything to do with it." Later, little Gordon <lb/>
let the author of his being see him do it. After <lb/>
that he did it frequently; probably every time <lb/>
anybody was looking. I would rather have <lb/>
that child than a chromo. If this tale has any <lb/>
object, it is to intimate that the inspired book <lb/>
was supernaturally able to convey a sense of its <lb/>
sacred and awful character to this innocent lit- <lb/>
tle creature, without the intervention of outside <lb/>
<pb n="64"/>
aids. The magazine is not edited with high- <lb/>
priced discretion. The editor has a "claim," <lb/>
and he ought to get it treated.</p>
<p>Among other witnesses there is one who had <lb/>
a "jumping toothache," which several times <lb/>
tempted her to "believe that there was sensa- <lb/>
tion in matter, but each time it was overcome <lb/>
by the power of Truth." She would not allow <lb/>
the dentist to use cocaine, but sat there and let <lb/>
him punch and drill and split and crush the <lb/>
tooth, and tear and slash its ulcerations, and <lb/>
pull out the nerve, and dig out fragments of <lb/>
bone; and she wouldn't once confess that it hurt. <lb/>
And to this day she thinks it didn't, and I have <lb/>
not a doubt that she is nine-tenths right, and <lb/>
that her Christian-Science faith did her better <lb/>
service than she could have gotten out of cocaine.</p>
<p>There is an account of a boy who got broken <lb/>
all up into small bits by an accident, but said <lb/>
over the Scientific Statement of Being, or some <lb/>
of the other incantations, and got well and <lb/>
sound without having suffered any real pain <lb/>
and without the intrusion of a surgeon.</p>
<p>Also, there is an account of the restoration <lb/>
to perfect health, in a single night, of a fatally <lb/>
<pb n="65"/>
injured <i>horse</i>, by the application of Christian <lb/>
Science. I can stand a good deal, but I recog- <lb/>
nize that the ice is getting thin, here. That <lb/>
horse had as many as fifty claims; how could <lb/>
<i>he</i> demonstrate over them? Could he do the <lb/>
All-Good, Good-Good, Good-Gracious, Liver, <lb/>
Bones, Truth, All down but Nine, Set them up <lb/>
on the Other Alley? Could he intone the Sci- <lb/>
entific Statement of Being? Now, could he? <lb/>
Wouldn't it give him a relapse? Let us draw <lb/>
the line at horses. Horses and furniture.</p>
<p>There is plenty of other testimonies in the <lb/>
magazine, but these quoted samples will an- <lb/>
swer. They show the kind of trade the Science <lb/>
is driving. Now we come back to the question, <lb/>
Does the Science kill a patient here and there <lb/>
and now and then? We must concede it. Does <lb/>
it compensate for this? I am persuaded that it <lb/>
can make a plausible showing in that direction. <lb/>
For instance: when it lays its hand upon a sol- <lb/>
dier who has suffered thirty years of helpless <lb/>
torture and makes him whole in body and mind, <lb/>
what is the actual sum of that achievement? <lb/>
This, I think: that it has restored to life a sub- <lb/>
ject who had essentially died ten deaths a year <lb/>
<pb n="66"/>
for thirty years, and each of them a long and <lb/>
painful one. But for its interference that man <lb/>
in the three years which have since elapsed, <lb/>
would have essentially died thirty times more. <lb/>
There are thousands of young people in the land <lb/>
who are now ready to enter upon a life - long <lb/>
death similar to that man's. Every time the <lb/>
Science captures one of these and secures to him <lb/>
life-long immunity from imagination-manufact- <lb/>
ured disease, it may plausibly claim that in his <lb/>
person it has saved three hundred lives. Mean- <lb/>
time, it will kill a man every now and then. But <lb/>
no matter, it will still be ahead on the credit side.</p>
<q><smcap>Note</smcap>.&#x2014;I have received several letters (two from edu- <lb/>
cated and ostensibly intelligent persons), which contained, <lb/>
in substance, this protest: "I don't object to men and <lb/>
women chancing their lives with these people, but it is a <lb/>
burning shame that the law should allow them to trust <lb/>
their helpless little children in their deadly hands." <lb/>
Isn't it touching? Isn't it deep? Isn't it modest? It is <lb/>
as if the person said: "I know that to a parent his child is <lb/>
the core of his heart, the apple of his eye, a possession so <lb/>
dear, so precious that he will trust its life in no hands but <lb/>
those which he believes, with all his soul, to be the very best <lb/>
and the very safest, but it is a burning shame that the law <lb/>
does not require him to come to <i>me</i> to ask what kind of <lb/>
healer I will allow him to call." The public is merely a <lb/>
multiplied "me."&#x2014;M.T.</q>

<p>Particularly after her death; for then, as any <lb/>
one can foresee, Eddy-Worship will be taught <lb/>
in the Sunday-schools and pulpits of the cult. <lb/>
Already whatever she puts her trade-mark on, <lb/>
though it be only a memorial-spoon, is holy and <lb/>
is eagerly and gratefully bought by the disciple, <lb/>
and becomes a fetich in his house. I say <lb/>
bought, for the Boston Christian-Science Trust <lb/>
gives nothing away; everything it has is for sale. <lb/>
And the terms are cash; and not only cash, but <lb/>
cash in advance. Its god is Mrs. Eddy first, <lb/>
then the Dollar. Not a spiritual Dollar, but a <lb/>
real one. From end to end of the Christian- <lb/>
Science literature not a single (material) thing <lb/>
in the world is conceded to be real, except the <lb/>
Dollar. But all through and through its ad- <lb/>
vertisements that reality is eagerly and per- <lb/>
sistently recognized.</p>
<p>The Dollar is hunted down in all sorts of <lb/>
ways; the Christian-Science Mother-Church and <lb/>

Bargain - Counter in Boston peddles all kinds <lb/>
of spiritual wares to the faithful, and always <lb/>
on the one condition&#x2014;<i>cash</i>, cash in advance. <lb/>
The Angel of the Apocalypse could not go there <lb/>
and get a copy of his own pirated book on cred- <lb/>

sons; Church Manual; C. S. Hymnal; History <lb/>
of the building of the Mother-Church; lot of <lb/>
Sermons; Communion Hymn, "Saw Ye My <lb/>
Saviour," by Mrs. Eddy, half a dollar a copy, <lb/>
"words used by special permission of Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy." Also we have Mrs. Eddy's and the <lb/>
Angel's little Bible-Annex in eight styles of <lb/>
binding at eight kinds of war-prices; among <lb/>
these a sweet thing in "levant, divinity circuit, <lb/>
leather lined to edge, round corners, gold edge, <lb/>

is to say, "prepaid, &#x0024;5.75." Also we have Mrs. <lb/>

<p>The Trust has still other sources of income. <lb/>

<p>In order to force the sale of Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>

means a large and constantly augmenting in- <lb/>

consider itself loyal or pious or pain-proof with- <lb/>
out an Annex or two in the house. That means <lb/>
an income for the Trust, in the near future, of <lb/>
millions; not thousands&#x2014;millions a year.</p>
<p>No member, young or old, of a branch Chris- <lb/>

membership in the Mother - Church unless he <lb/>
pay "capitation tax" (of "not less than a dol- <lb/>

I think it a reasonable guess that the Trust <lb/>
(which is already in our day pretty brusque in <lb/>
its ways) will then be the most insolent and <lb/>
unscrupulous and tyrannical politico-religious <lb/>
master that has dominated a people since the <lb/>
palmy days of the Inquisition. And a stronger <lb/>
master than the strongest of bygone times, <lb/>
because this one will have a financial strength <lb/>
not dreamed of by any predecessor; as effective <lb/>
a concentration of irresponsible power as any <lb/>
predecessor has had;<ref target="n15"><sup>2</sup></ref><note id="n15" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>2</sup></seg><p>It can be put stronger than that and still be true.&#x2014; <lb/>

<p>The Roman Church has a perfect organiza- <lb/>
tion, and it has an effective centralization of <lb/>

Bishops are rich, but their riches remain in <lb/>
large measure in their own hands. They col- <lb/>
lect from two hundred millions of people, but <lb/>
they keep the bulk of the result at home. The <lb/>
Boston Pope of by-and-by will draw his dollar- <lb/>
a-head capitation-tax from three hundred mill- <lb/>

cripples received, and no imitations of miracu- <lb/>
lously restored broken legs and necks allowed <lb/>
to be hung up except when made out of the <lb/>
Holy Metal and proved by fire-assay; cash for <lb/>
miracles worked at the tomb: these money- <lb/>
sources, with a thousand to be yet invented <lb/>
and ambushed upon the devotee, will bring <lb/>
the annual increment well up above a billion. <lb/>
And nobody but the Trust will have the hand- <lb/>
ling of it. In that day, the Trust will monop- <lb/>
olize the manufacture and sale of the Old and <lb/>
New Testaments as well as the Annex, and <lb/>
raise their price to Annex rates, and compel <lb/>
the devotee to buy (for even to-day a healer <lb/>
has to have the Annex <i>and</i> the Scriptures or <lb/>
he is not allowed to work the game), and that <lb/>
will bring several hundred million dollars more. <lb/>
In those days, the Trust will have an income <lb/>
approaching five million dollars a day, and <lb/>
no expenses to be taken out of it; no tax- <lb/>
es to pay, and <i>no charities to support</i>. That <lb/>
last detail should not be lightly passed over <lb/>
<pb n="75"/>
by the reader; it is well entitled to atten- <lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>No charities to support. No, nor even to con- <lb/>
tribute to. One searches in vain the Trust's <lb/>
advertisements and the utterances of its or- <lb/>
gans for any suggestion that it spends a penny <lb/>
on orphans, widows, discharged prisoners, hos- <lb/>
pitals, ragged schools, night missions, city mis- <lb/>
sions, libraries, old people's homes, or any other <lb/>
object that appeals to a human being's purse <lb/>

<p>I have hunted, hunted, and hunted, by cor- <lb/>
respondence and otherwise, and have not yet <lb/>
got upon the track of a farthing that the Trust <lb/>
has spent upon any worthy object. Nothing <lb/>
makes a Scientist so uncomfortable as to ask <lb/>
him if he knows of a case where Christian <lb/>
Science has spent money on a benevolence, <lb/>
either among its own adherents or elsewhere. <lb/>
He is obliged to say "No." And then one dis- <lb/>
covers that the person questioned has been <lb/>
<pb n="76"/>
asked the question many times before, and that <lb/>
it is getting to be a sore subject with him. Why <lb/>
a sore subject? Because he has written his <lb/>
chiefs and asked with high confidence for an <lb/>
answer that will confound these questioners&#x2014; <lb/>
and the chiefs did not reply. He has written <lb/>
again, and then again&#x2014;not with confidence, <lb/>
but humbly, now&#x2014;and has begged for defen- <lb/>
sive ammunition in the voice of supplication. <lb/>
A reply does at last come&#x2014;to this effect: "We <lb/>
must have faith in Our Mother, and rest con- <lb/>
tent in the conviction that whatever She<ref target="n18"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n18" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>I may be introducing the capital S a little early&#x2014;still <lb/>

with the money it is in accordance with orders <lb/>
from Heaven, for She does no act of any kind <lb/>
without first 'demonstrating over' it."</p>
<p>That settles it&#x2014;as far as the disciple is con- <lb/>
cerned. His mind is satisfied with that answer; <lb/>
he gets down his Annex and does an incanta- <lb/>
tion or two, and that mesmerizes his spirit and <lb/>
puts <i>that</i> to sleep&#x2014;brings it peace. Peace and <lb/>
comfort and joy, until some inquirer punctures <lb/>
the old sore again.</p>
<p>Through friends in America I asked some <lb/>
<pb n="77"/>
questions, and in some cases got definite and <lb/>
informing answers; in other cases the answers <lb/>
were not definite and not valuable. To the <lb/>
question, "Does any of the money go to chari- <lb/>
ties?" the answer from an authoritative source <lb/>

was: "No, <i>not in the sense usually conveyed by <lb/>
this word</i>." (The italics are mine.) That an- <lb/>
swer is cautious. But definite, I think&#x2014;utter- <lb/>
ly and unassailably definite&#x2014;although quite <lb/>
Christian-Scientifically foggy in its phrasing. <lb/>
Christian-Science testimony is generally foggy, <lb/>
generally diffuse, generally garrulous. The <lb/>
writer was aware that the first word in his <lb/>
phrase answered the question which I was ask- <lb/>
ing, but he could not help adding nine dark <lb/>
words. Meaningless ones, unless explained by <lb/>
him. It is quite likely, as intimated by him, <lb/>
that Christian Science has invented a new class <lb/>
of objects to apply the word "charity" to, but <lb/>
without an explanation we cannot know what <lb/>
they are. We quite easily and naturally and <lb/>
confidently guess that they are in all cases ob- <lb/>

from a lady who says that while she was living in Boston, <lb/>
a few years ago, she visited the Mother-Church and offices <lb/>

"first reader," who "stated positively that the Church, as <lb/>
a body, does no philanthropic work whatever."&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></p>
<p>Sly? Deep? Judicious? The Trust under- <lb/>
stands its business. The Trust does not give <lb/>
itself away. It defeats all the attempts of us <lb/>
impertinents to get at its trade secrets. To <lb/>
this day, after all our diligence, we have not <lb/>
been able to get it to confess what it does with <lb/>
the money. It does not even let its own disci- <lb/>
ples find out. All it says is, that the matter <lb/>
has been "demonstrated over." Now and <lb/>
then a lay Scientist says, with a grateful exul- <lb/>
tation, that Mrs. Eddy is enormously rich, but <lb/>
he stops there; as to whether any of the money <lb/>
goes to other charities or not, he is obliged to <lb/>
admit that he does not know. However, the <lb/>
Trust is composed of human beings; and this <lb/>
justifies the conjecture that if it had a charity <lb/>
<pb n="79"/>
on its list which it was proud of, we should soon <lb/>
hear of it.</p>
<p>"Without money and without price." Those <lb/>
used to be the terms. Mrs. Eddy's Annex can- <lb/>
cels them. The motto of Christian Science is, <lb/>
"The laborer is worthy of his hire." And now <lb/>
that it has been "demonstrated over," we find <lb/>
its spiritual meaning to be, "Do anything and <lb/>
everything your hand may find to do; and <lb/>
charge cash for it, and collect the money in ad- <lb/>
vance." The Scientist has on his tongue's end <lb/>
a cut-and-dried, Boston-supplied set of rather <lb/>
lean arguments, whose function is to show that <lb/>
it is a Heaven-commanded <i>duty</i> to do this, and <lb/>
that the croupiers of the game have no choice <lb/>
but to obey.<ref target="n20"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n20" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><quotedLetter>
<p><i>February</i>, 1903. If I seem to be charging any one out- <lb/>
side of the Trust with an exaggerated appetite for money, <lb/>
I have not meant to do it. The exactions of the ordinary <lb/>
C. S. "healer" are not exorbitant. If I have prejudices <lb/>
against the Trust&#x2014;and I do feel that I have&#x2014;they do <lb/>
not extend to the lay membership. "The laborer is <lb/>
worthy of his hire." And is entitled to receive it, too, <lb/>
and charge his own price (when he is laboring in a lawful <lb/>
calling). The great surgeon charges a thousand dollars, <lb/>
and no one is justified in objecting to it. The great <lb/>
preacher and teacher in religion receives a large salary, <lb/>
and is entitled to it; Henry Ward Beecher's was twenty <lb/>
thousand dollars. Mrs. Eddy's Metaphysical College was <lb/>
chartered by the State, and she had a legal right to <lb/>
charge amazing prices, and she did it. She allows only <lb/>
a few persons to <i>teach</i> Christian Science. The calling of <lb/>
these teachers is not illegal. Mrs. Eddy appoints the <lb/>
sum their students must pay, and it is a round one; but <lb/>
that is no matter, since they need not come unless they <lb/>
want to.</p>
<p>But when we come to the C. S. "healer," the <i>practi- <lb/>
tioner</i>, that is another thing. He exists by the hundred; <lb/>
his services are prized by his C. S. patient, they are pre- <lb/>
ferred above all other human help, and are thankfully <lb/>
paid for. As I have just remarked, his prices are not <lb/>
large. But there is hardly a State wherein he can lawfully <lb/>
practise his profession. In the name of religion, of mor- <lb/>
als, and of Christ&#x2014;represented on the earth by Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
&#x2014;he enters upon his trade a commissioned law-breaker.</p>
<p>A law-breaker. It is curious, but if the Second Advent <lb/>
should happen now, Jesus could not heal the sick in the <lb/>
State of New York. He could not do it lawfully; there- <lb/>
fore He could not do it morally; therefore He could not do <lb/>
it at all.&#x2014;M. T.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 12, 1903. While I am reading the final proofs <lb/>
of this book, the following letter has come to me. It is <lb/>
not marked private, therefore I suppose I may without <lb/>
impropriety insert it here, if I suppress the signature:</p>
<p>"<smcap>Dear Sir</smcap>,&#x2014;In the <i>North American Review</i> for Janu- <lb/>
ary is the statement, in effect, that Christian Scientists <lb/>
give nothing to charities. It has had wide reading and is <lb/>
doubtless credited. To produce a true impression, it seems <lb/>
as if other facts should have been stated in connection.</p>
<p>"With regret for adding anything to the burden of <lb/>
letters from strangers, I am impelled to write what I <lb/>
know from a limited acquaintance in the sect. I am not <lb/>
connected with it myself.</p>
<p>"The charity freely given by individual practitioners, <lb/>
so far as I know it, is at least equal to that of regular <lb/>
physicians. Charges are made with much more than <lb/>
equal consideration of the means of the patient. Of <lb/>
course druggists' bills and the enormous expenses in- <lb/>
volved in the employment of a trained nurse, exist in <lb/>
small degree or not at all.</p>
<p>"As to organized charities: It is hard to find one where <lb/>
the most intelligent laborers in it feel that they are reach- <lb/>
ing the root of an evil. They are putting a few plasters <lb/>
on a body of disease. Complaint is made, too, that the <lb/>
machinery, by which of necessity systematic charity must <lb/>
be administered, prevents the personal friendliness and <lb/>
sympathy which should pervade it throughout.</p>
<p>"Christian Science claims to be able to abolish the need <lb/>
for charity. The results of drunkenness make great de- <lb/>
mands upon the charitable. But the principle of Chris- <lb/>
tian Science takes away the desire for strong drink. If <lb/>
sexual propensities were dominated, not only by reason, <lb/>
but by Christian love for both the living and the unborn <lb/>
&#x2014;Christian Science is emphatic on this subject&#x2014;many <lb/>
existing charitable societies would have no reason to be. <lb/>
So far as Christian Science prevents disease, the need for <lb/>
hospitals is lessened. Not only illness, but poverty, is a <lb/>
subject for the practice of Christian Science. If this evil <lb/>
were prevented there would be no occasion to alleviate <lb/>
its results.</p>
<p>"The faith, hope, and love which the few Christian <lb/>
Scientists I have known have lived and radiated, made <lb/>
conditions needing organized charity vanish before them.</p>

own 'Uncle Silas' was 'loved back' to sanity,</p>

<p>The Trust seems to be a reincarnation. Ex- <lb/>

<pb n="81"/>
<p>I have no reverence for the Trust, but I am <lb/>
not lacking in reverence for the sincerities of <lb/>
<pb n="82"/>
the lay membership of the new Church. There <lb/>
is every evidence that the lay members are <lb/>
entirely sincere in their faith, and I think sin- <lb/>
cerity is always entitled to honor and respect, <lb/>
let the inspiration of the sincerity be what it <lb/>
may. Zeal and sincerity can carry a new re- <lb/>
ligion further than any other missionary except <lb/>
fire and sword, and I believe that the new re- <lb/>
ligion will conquer the half of Christendom in a <lb/>
hundred years. I am not intending this as a <lb/>
compliment to the human race; I am merely <lb/>
stating an opinion. And yet I think that per- <lb/>
haps it <i>is</i> a compliment to the race. I keep in <lb/>
mind that saying of an orthodox preacher&#x2014; <lb/>
quoted further back. He conceded that this <lb/>
new Christianity frees its possessor's life from <lb/>
<i>frets, fears, vexations, bitterness, and all sorts of <lb/>
imagination-propagated maladies and pains, and <lb/>
fills his world with sunshine and his heart with</i> <lb/>
<pb n="83"/>
<i>gladness</i>. If Christian Science, with this stu- <lb/>
pendous equipment&#x2014;and final salvation added <lb/>
&#x2014;cannot win half the Christian globe, I must <lb/>
be badly mistaken in the make-up of the hu- <lb/>
man race.</p>
<p>I think the Trust will be handed down like <lb/>
the other Papacy, and will always know how <lb/>
to handle its limitless cash. It will press the <lb/>
button; the zeal, the energy, the sincerity, the <lb/>
enthusiasm of its countless vassals will do the <lb/>
rest.</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> power which a man's imagination has <lb/>
over his body to heal it or make it sick is a force <lb/>
which none of us is born without. The first <lb/>
man had it, the last one will possess it. If left <lb/>
to himself, a man is most likely to use only the <lb/>
mischievous half of the force&#x2014;the half which <lb/>
invents imaginary ailments for him and culti- <lb/>
vates them; and if he is one of these very wise <lb/>
people, he is quite likely to scoff at the benef- <lb/>
icent half of the force and deny its existence. <lb/>
And so, to heal or help that man, <i>two</i> imagina- <lb/>
tions are required: his own and some outsider's. <lb/>
The outsider, B, must imagine that <i>his</i> incanta- <lb/>
tions are the healing-power that is curing A, <lb/>
and A must imagine that this is so. I think it <lb/>
is not so, at all; but no matter, the cure is ef- <lb/>
fected, and that is the main thing. The out- <lb/>
sider's work is unquestionably valuable; so <lb/>
valuable that it may fairly be likened to the es- <lb/>
sential work performed by the engineer when <lb/>
<pb n="85"/>
he handles the throttle and turns on the steam; <lb/>
the actual power is lodged exclusively in the <lb/>
engine, but if the engine were left alone it <lb/>
would never start of itself. Whether the en- <lb/>
gineer be named Jim, or Bob, or Tom, it is all <lb/>
one&#x2014;his services are necessary, and he is en- <lb/>
titled to such wage as he can get you to pay. <lb/>
Whether he be named Christian Scientist, or <lb/>
Mental Scientist, or Mind Curist, or King's-Evil <lb/>
Expert, or Hypnotist, it is all one; he is merely <lb/>
the Engineer; he simply turns on the same old <lb/>
steam and the engine does the whole work.</p>
<p>The Christian-Scientist engineer drives ex- <lb/>
actly the same trade as the other engineers, yet <lb/>
he out-prospers the whole of them put together.<ref target="n21"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n21" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p><i>February</i>, 1903. As I have already remarked in a <lb/>

<p>Is it because he has captured the takingest <lb/>
name? I think that that is only a small part <lb/>
of it. I think that the secret of his high pros- <lb/>
perity lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Christian Scientist has <i>organized</i> the <lb/>
business. Now that was certainly a gigantic <lb/>
idea. Electricity, in limitless volume, has ex- <lb/>
<pb n="86"/>
isted in the air and the rocks and the earth and <lb/>
everywhere since time began&#x2014;and was going <lb/>
to waste all the while. In our time we have <lb/>
<i>organized</i> that scattered and wandering force <lb/>
and set it to work, and backed the business with <lb/>
capital, and concentrated it in few and compe- <lb/>
tent hands, and the results are as we see.</p>
<p>The Christian Scientist has taken a force <lb/>
which has been lying idle in every member of <lb/>
the human race since time began, and has or- <lb/>
ganized it, and backed the business with capi- <lb/>
tal, and concentrated it at Boston headquar- <lb/>
ters in the hands of a small and very competent <lb/>
Trust, and there are results.</p>
<p>Therein lies the promise that this monopoly <lb/>
is going to extend its commerce wide in the <lb/>
earth. I think that if the business were con- <lb/>
ducted in the loose and disconnected fashion <lb/>
customary with such things, it would achieve <lb/>
but little more than the modest prosperity usu- <lb/>
ally secured by unorganized great moral and <lb/>
commercial ventures; but I believe that so long <lb/>
as this one remains compactly organized and <lb/>
closely concentrated in a Trust, the spread of <lb/>
its dominion will continue.</p>

<p><smcap>Four</smcap> years ago I wrote the preceding chap- <lb/>
ters.<ref target="n22"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n22" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>That is to say, in 1898.</p></note> I was assured by the wise that Chris- <lb/>
tian Science was a fleeting craze and would <lb/>
soon perish. This prompt and all-competent <lb/>
stripe of prophet is always to be had in the <lb/>
market at ground-floor rates. He does not <lb/>
stop to load, or consider, or take aim, but <lb/>
lets fly just as he stands. Facts are nothing <lb/>
to him, he has no use for such things; he <lb/>
works wholly by inspiration. And so, when <lb/>
he is asked why he considers a new move- <lb/>
ment a passing fad and quickly perishable, <lb/>
he finds himself unprepared with a reason and <lb/>
is more or less embarrassed. For a moment. <lb/>
Only for a moment. Then he waylays the first <lb/>
spectre of a reason that goes flitting through the <lb/>
desert places of his mind, and is at once serene <lb/>
again and ready for conflict. Serene and con- <lb/>
fident. Yet he should not be so, since he has <lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
had no chance to examine his catch, and cannot <lb/>
know whether it is going to help his contention <lb/>
or damage it.</p>
<p>The impromptu reason furnished by the <lb/>
early prophets of whom I have spoken was <lb/>
this:</p>
<p>"There is nothing <i>to</i> Christian Science; there <lb/>
is nothing about it that appeals to the intellect; <lb/>
its market will be restricted to the unintelligent, <lb/>
the mentally inferior, the people who do not <lb/>
think."</p>
<p>They called that a reason why the cult would <lb/>
not flourish and endure. It seems the equiva- <lb/>
lent of saying:</p>
<p>"There is no money in tinware; there is noth- <lb/>
ing about it that appeals to the rich; its market <lb/>
will be restricted to the poor."</p>
<p>It is like bringing forward the best reason in <lb/>
the world why Christian Science should flour- <lb/>
ish and live, and then blandly offering it as a <lb/>
reason why it should sicken and die.</p>
<p>That reason was furnished me by the com- <lb/>
placent and unfrightened prophets four years <lb/>
ago, and it has been furnished me again to-day. <lb/>
If conversions to new religions or to old ones <lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
were in any considerable degree achieved <lb/>
through the intellect, the aforesaid reason <lb/>
would be sound and sufficient, no doubt; the <lb/>
inquirer into Christian Science might go away <lb/>
unconvinced and unconverted. But we all <lb/>
know that conversions are seldom made in that <lb/>
way; that such a thing as a serious and pains- <lb/>
taking and fairly competent inquiry into the <lb/>
claims of a religion or of a political dogma is a <lb/>
rare occurrence; and that the vast mass of men <lb/>
and women are far from being capable of mak- <lb/>
ing such an examination. They are not ca- <lb/>
pable, for the reason that their minds, howso- <lb/>
ever good they may be, are not trained for such <lb/>
examinations. The mind not trained for that <lb/>
work is no more competent to do it than are <lb/>
lawyers and farmers competent to make suc- <lb/>
cessful clothes without learning the tailor's <lb/>
trade. There are seventy-five million men and <lb/>
women among us who do not know how to cut <lb/>
out and make a dress-suit, and they would not <lb/>
think of trying; yet they all think they can <lb/>
competently think out a political or religious <lb/>
scheme without any apprenticeship to the busi- <lb/>
ness, and many of them believe they have act- <lb/>
<pb n="90"/>
ually worked that miracle. But, indeed, the <lb/>
truth is, almost all the men and women of our <lb/>
nation or of any other get their religion and <lb/>
their politics where they get their astronomy <lb/>
&#x2014;entirely at second hand. Being untrained, <lb/>
they are no more able to intelligently examine <lb/>
a dogma or a policy than they are to calculate <lb/>
an eclipse.</p>
<p>Men are usually competent thinkers along <lb/>
the lines of their specialized training only. <lb/>
Within these limits alone are their opinions <lb/>
and judgments valuable; outside of these limits <lb/>
they grope and are lost&#x2014;usually without know- <lb/>
ing it. In a church assemblage of five hundred <lb/>
persons, there will be a man or two whose train- <lb/>
ed minds can seize upon each detail of a great <lb/>
manufacturing scheme and recognize its value <lb/>
or its lack of value promptly; and can pass the <lb/>
details in intelligent review, section by section, <lb/>
and finally as a whole, and then deliver a ver- <lb/>
dict upon the scheme which cannot be flippant- <lb/>
ly set aside nor easily answered. And there will <lb/>
be one or two other men there who can do the <lb/>
same thing with a great and complicated edu- <lb/>
cational project; and one or two others who <lb/>
<pb n="91"/>
can do the like with a large scheme for applying <lb/>
electricity in a new and unheard-of way; and <lb/>
one or two others who can do it with a showy <lb/>
scheme for revolutionizing the scientific world's <lb/>
accepted notions regarding geology. And so <lb/>
on, and so on. But the manufacturing experts <lb/>
will not be competent to examine the educa- <lb/>
tional scheme intelligently, and their opinion <lb/>
about it would not be valuable; neither of these <lb/>
two groups will be able to understand and pass <lb/>
upon the electrical scheme; none of these three <lb/>
batches of experts will be able to understand <lb/>
and pass upon the geological revolution; and <lb/>
probably not one man in the entire lot will be <lb/>
competent to examine, capably, the intricacies <lb/>
of a political or religious scheme, new or old, <lb/>
and deliver a judgment upon it which any one <lb/>
need regard as precious.</p>
<p>There you have the top crust. There will be <lb/>
four hundred and seventy-five men and women <lb/>
present who can draw upon their training and <lb/>
deliver incontrovertible judgments concerning <lb/>
cheese, and leather, and cattle, and hardware, <lb/>
and soap, and tar, and candles, and patent <lb/>
medicines, and dreams, and apparitions, and <lb/>
<pb n="92"/>
garden truck, and cats, and baby food, and <lb/>
warts, and hymns, and time-tables, and freight- <lb/>
rates, and summer resorts, and whiskey, and <lb/>
law, and surgery, and dentistry, and black- <lb/>
smithing, and shoemaking, and dancing, and <lb/>
Huyler's candy, and mathematics, and dog <lb/>
fights, and obstetrics, and music, and sausages, <lb/>
and dry goods, and molasses, and railroad <lb/>
stocks, and horses, and literature, and labor <lb/>
unions, and vegetables, and morals, and lamb's <lb/>
fries, and etiquette, and agriculture. And not <lb/>
ten among the five hundred&#x2014;let their minds <lb/>
be ever so good and bright&#x2014;will be competent, <lb/>
by grace of the requisite specialized mental <lb/>
training, to take hold of a complex abstraction <lb/>
of any kind and make head or tail of it.</p>
<p>The whole five hundred are thinkers, and <lb/>
they are all capable thinkers&#x2014;but only within <lb/>
the narrow limits of their specialized trainings. <lb/>
Four hundred and ninety of them cannot com- <lb/>
petently examine either a religious plan or a <lb/>
political one. A scattering few of them do ex- <lb/>
amine both&#x2014;that is, they think they do. With <lb/>
results as precious as when I examine the neb- <lb/>
ular theory and explain it to myself.</p>
<pb n="93"/>
<p>If the four hundred and ninety got their re- <lb/>
ligion through their minds, and by weighed <lb/>
and measured detail, Christian Science would <lb/>
not be a scary apparition. But they don't; <lb/>
they get a little of it through their minds, more <lb/>
of it through their feelings, and the overwhelm- <lb/>
ing bulk of it through their environment.</p>
<p><i>Environment</i> is the chief thing to be con- <lb/>
sidered when one is proposing to predict the <lb/>
future of Christian Science. It is not the abil- <lb/>
ity to reason that makes the Presbyterian, or <lb/>
the Baptist, or the Methodist, or the Catholic, <lb/>
or the Mohammedan, or the Buddhist, or the <lb/>
Mormon; it is <i>environment</i>. If religions were <lb/>
got by reasoning, we should have the extraor- <lb/>
dinary spectacle of an American family with a <lb/>
Presbyterian in it, and a Baptist, a Methodist, <lb/>
a Catholic, a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, and a <lb/>
Mormon. A Presbyterian family does not pro- <lb/>
duce Catholic families or other religious brands, <lb/>
it produces its own kind; and not by intellect- <lb/>
ual processes, but by association. And so also <lb/>
with Mohammedanism, the cult which in our <lb/>
day is spreading with the sweep of a world- <lb/>
conflagration through the Orient, that native <lb/>
<pb n="94"/>
home of profound thought and of subtle intel- <lb/>
lectual fence, that fertile womb whence has <lb/>
sprung every great religion that exists. In- <lb/>
cluding our own; for with all our brains we <lb/>
cannot invent a religion and market it.</p>
<p>The language of my quoted prophets recurs <lb/>
to us now, and we wonder to think how small <lb/>
a space in the world the mighty Mohammedan <lb/>
Church would be occupying now, if a success- <lb/>
ful trade in its line of goods had been condi- <lb/>
tioned upon an exhibit that would "appeal to <lb/>
the intellect" instead of to "the unintelligent, <lb/>
the mentally inferior, the people who do not <lb/>
think."</p>
<p>The Christian Science Church, like the Mo- <lb/>
hammedan Church, makes no embarrassing <lb/>
appeal to the intellect, has no occasion to do it, <lb/>
and can get along quite well without it.</p>
<p><i>Provided</i>. Provided what? That it can <lb/>
secure that thing which is worth two or three <lb/>
hundred thousand times more than an "appeal <lb/>
to the intellect"&#x2014;an <i>environment</i>. Can it get <lb/>
that? Will it be a menace to regular Chris- <lb/>
tianity if it gets that? Is it time for regular <lb/>
Christianity to get alarmed? Or shall regular <lb/>
<pb n="95"/>
Christianity smile a smile and turn over and <lb/>
take another nap? Won't it be wise and prop- <lb/>
er for regular Christianity to do the old way, <lb/>
the customary way, the historical way&#x2014;lock <lb/>
the stable-door after the horse is gone? Just <lb/>
as Protestantism has smiled and nodded this <lb/>
long time (while the alert and diligent Catholic <lb/>
was slipping in and capturing the public <lb/>
schools), and is now beginning to hunt around <lb/>
for the key when it is too late?</p>
<p>Will Christian Science get a chance to show <lb/>
its wares? It has <i>already</i> secured that chance. <lb/>
Will it flourish and spread and prosper if it shall <lb/>
create for itself the one thing essential to those <lb/>
conditions&#x2014;an environment? It has <i>already</i> <lb/>
created an environment. There are families of <lb/>
Christian Scientists in every community in <lb/>
America, and each family is a factory; each <lb/>
family turns out a Christian Science product <lb/>
at the customary intervals, and contributes it <lb/>
to the Cause in the only way in which contri- <lb/>
butions of recruits to Churches are ever made <lb/>
on a large scale&#x2014;by the puissant forces of per- <lb/>
sonal contact and association. Each family is <lb/>
an agency for the Cause, and makes converts <lb/>
<pb n="96"/>
among the neighbors, and starts some more fac- <lb/>
tories.</p>
<p>Four years ago there were six Christian Sci- <lb/>
entists in a certain town that I am acquainted <lb/>
with; a year ago there were two hundred and <lb/>
fifty there; they have built a church, and its <lb/>
membership now numbers four hundred. This <lb/>
has all been quietly done; done without fren- <lb/>
zied revivals, without uniforms, brass bands, <lb/>
street parades, corner oratory, or any of the <lb/>
other customary persuasions to a godly life. <lb/>
Christian Science, like Mohammedanism, is <lb/>
"restricted" to the "unintelligent, the people <lb/>
who do not think." There lies the danger. It <lb/>
makes Christian Science formidable. It is "re- <lb/>
stricted" to ninety-nine one-hundredths of the <lb/>
human race, and must be reckoned with by <lb/>
regular Christianity. And will be, as soon as <lb/>
it is too late.</p>

<p><smcap>There</smcap> were remarkable things about the stranger <lb/>

that they monopolized attention and made <i>all</i> of him <lb/>

stupendous, and his dreams had no commerce with the <lb/>
humble plain, but moved with the cloud-rack among <lb/>
the snow-summits. These features of him were, indeed, <lb/>
extraordinary, but the rest of him was ordinary and <lb/>
usual. He was so mean-minded, in the matter of jeal- <lb/>
ousy, that it was thought he was descended from a god; <lb/>
he was vain in little ways, and had a pride in trivialities; <lb/>
he doted on ballads about moonshine and bruised <lb/>
hearts; in education he was deficient, he was indifferent <lb/>
to literature, and knew nothing of art; he was dumb <lb/>
upon all subjects but one, indifferent to all except that <lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
one&#x2014;the Nebular Theory. Upon that one his flow of <lb/>
words was full and free, he was a geyser. The official <lb/>
astronomers disputed his facts and derided his views, <lb/>
and said that he had invented both, they not being <lb/>
findable in any of the books. But many of the laity, <lb/>
who wanted their nebulosities fresh, admired his doc- <lb/>
trine and adopted it, and it attained to great prosperity <lb/>
in spite of the hostility of the experts."&#x2014;<i>The Legend of <lb/>

<p><i><smcap>January</smcap></i>, 1903. When we do not know a <lb/>
public man personally, we guess him out by the <lb/>
facts of his career. When it is Washington, we <lb/>
all arrive at about one and the same result. We <lb/>
agree that his words and his acts clearly inter- <lb/>
pret his character to us, and that they never <lb/>
leave us in doubt as to the motives whence the <lb/>
words and acts proceeded. It is the same with <lb/>
Joan of Arc, it is the same with two or three or <lb/>
five or six others among the immortals. But <lb/>
in the matter of motives and of a few details of <lb/>
character we agree to disagree upon Napoleon, <lb/>
Cromwell, and all the rest; and to this list we <lb/>
must add Mrs. Eddy. I think we can peace- <lb/>
fully agree as to two or three extraordinary <lb/>
features of her make-up, but not upon the <lb/>
other features of it. We cannot peacefully <lb/>
agree as to her motives, therefore her character <lb/>
must remain crooked to some of us and straight <lb/>
to the others.</p>
<pb n="102"/>
<p>No matter, she is interesting enough without <lb/>
an amicable agreement. In several ways she <lb/>
is the most interesting woman that ever lived, <lb/>
and the most extraordinary. The same may <lb/>
be said of her career, and the same may be said <lb/>
of its chief result. She started from nothing. <lb/>
Her enemies charge that she surreptitiously <lb/>
took from Quimby a peculiar system of healing <lb/>
which was mind-cure with a Biblical basis. <lb/>
She and her friends deny that she took any- <lb/>
thing from him. This is a matter which we <lb/>
can discuss by-and-by. Whether she took it <lb/>
or invented it, it was&#x2014;materially&#x2014;a sawdust <lb/>
mine when she got it, and she has turned it <lb/>
into a Klondike; its spiritual dock had next <lb/>
to no custom, if any at all: from it she has <lb/>
launched a world-religion which has now six <lb/>
hundred and sixty-three churches, and she <lb/>
charters a new one every four days. When <lb/>
we do not know a person&#x2014;and also when <lb/>
we do&#x2014;we have to judge his size by the <lb/>
size and nature of his achievements, as com- <lb/>
pared with the achievements of others in his <lb/>
special line of business&#x2014;there is no other <lb/>
way. Measured by this standard, it is thir- <lb/>
<pb n="103"/>
teen hundred years since the world has pro- <lb/>
duced any one who could reach up to Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy's waistbelt.</p>
<p>Figuratively speaking, Mrs. Eddy is already <lb/>
as tall as the Eiffel tower. She is adding sur- <lb/>
prisingly to her stature every day. It is quite <lb/>
within the probabilities that a century hence <lb/>
she will be the most imposing figure that has <lb/>
cast its shadow across the globe since the inau- <lb/>
guration of our era. I grant that after saying <lb/>
these strong things, it is necessary that I offer <lb/>
some details calculated to satisfactorily demon- <lb/>
strate the proportions which I have claimed <lb/>
for her. I will do that presently; but before <lb/>
exhibiting the matured <i>sequoia gigantea</i>, I be- <lb/>
lieve it will be best to exhibit the sprout from <lb/>
which it sprang. It may save the reader from <lb/>
making miscalculations. The person who im- <lb/>
agines that a Big Tree sprout is bigger than <lb/>
other kinds of sprouts is quite mistaken. <lb/>
It is the ordinary thing; it makes no show, <lb/>
it compels no notice, it hasn't a detectible <lb/>
quality in it that entitles it to attention, or <lb/>
suggests the future giant its sap is suckling. <lb/>
That is the kind of sprout Mrs. Eddy was. <lb/>
<pb n="104"/>
From her childhood days up to where she <lb/>
was running a half-century a close race and <lb/>
gaining on it, she was most humanly common- <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>She is the witness I am drawing this from. <lb/>
She has revealed it in her autobiography. Not <lb/>
intentionally, of course&#x2014;I am not claiming <lb/>
that. An autobiography is the most treacher- <lb/>
ous thing there is. It lets out every secret its <lb/>
author is trying to keep; it lets the truth shine <lb/>
unobstructed through every harmless little <lb/>
deception he tries to play; it pitilessly exposes <lb/>
him as a tin hero worshipping himself as Big <lb/>
Metal every time he tries to do the modest- <lb/>
unconsciousness act before the reader. This <lb/>
is not guessing; I am speaking from autobi- <lb/>
ographical personal experience; I was never <lb/>
able to refrain from mentioning, with a studied <lb/>
casualness that could deceive none but the <lb/>
most incautious reader, that an ancestor of <lb/>
mine was sent ambassador to Spain by Charles <lb/>
I., nor that in a remote branch of my family <lb/>
there exists a claimant to an earldom, nor that <lb/>
an uncle of mine used to own a dog that was <lb/>
descended from the dog that was in the Ark; <lb/>
<pb n="105"/>
and at the same time I was never able to per- <lb/>
suade myself to call a gibbet by its right name <lb/>
when accounting for other ancestors of mine, <lb/>
but always spoke of it as the "platform"&#x2014; <lb/>
puerilely intimating that they were out lectur- <lb/>
ing when it happened.</p>
<p>It is Mrs. Eddy over again. As regards her <lb/>
minor half, she is as commonplace as the rest <lb/>
of us. Vain of trivial things all the first half of <lb/>
her life, and still vain of them at seventy and <lb/>
recording them with na&#x00EF;ve satisfaction&#x2014;even <lb/>
rescuing some early rhymes of hers of the sort <lb/>
that we all scribble in the innocent days of our <lb/>
youth&#x2014;rescuing them and printing them with- <lb/>
out pity or apology, just as the weakest and <lb/>
commonest of us do in our gray age. More&#x2014; <lb/>
she still frankly admires them; and in her intro- <lb/>
duction of them profanely confers upon them <lb/>
the holy name of "poetry." Sample: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"And laud the land whose talents rock</l>
<l rend="indent">The cradle of her power,</l>
<l>And wreaths are twined round Plymouth Rock</l>
<l rend="indent">From erudition's bower."</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent">"Minerva's silver sandals still</l>
<l rend="indent2">Are loosed and not effete."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="106"/>
<p>You note it is not a shade above the thing <lb/>
which all human beings churn out in their <lb/>
youth.</p>
<p>You would not think that in a little wee <lb/>
primer&#x2014;for that is what the <i>Autobiography</i> <lb/>
is&#x2014;a person with a tumultuous career of sev- <lb/>
enty years behind her could find room for two <lb/>
or three pages of padding of this kind, but such <lb/>
is the case. She evidently puts narrative to- <lb/>
gether with difficulty and is not at home in it, <lb/>
and is glad to have something ready-made to <lb/>
fill in with. Another sample: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Here fame-honored Hickory rears his bold form,</l>
<l>And bears<ref target="n23"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n23" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Meaning <i>bares?</i> I think so.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> a brave breast to the lightning and storm,</l>
<l>While Palm, Bay, and Laurel in classical glee,</l>
<l>Chase Tulip, Magnolia, and fragrant Fringe-tree."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Vivid? You can fairly see those trees gal- <lb/>
loping around. That she could still treasure <lb/>
up, and print, and manifestly admire those <lb/>
Poems, indicates that the most daring and <lb/>
masculine and masterful woman that has ap- <lb/>
peared in the earth in centuries has the same <lb/>
soft, girly-girly places in her that the rest of us <lb/>
have.</p>
<pb n="107"/>
<p>When it comes to selecting her ancestors she <lb/>
is still human, natural, vain, commonplace&#x2014; <lb/>
as commonplace as I am myself when I am <lb/>
sorting ancestors for my autobiography. She <lb/>
combs out some creditable Scots, and labels <lb/>
them and sets them aside for use, not overlook- <lb/>
ing the one to whom Sir William Wallace gave <lb/>
"a heavy sword encased in a brass scabbard," <lb/>
and na&#x00EF;vely explaining <i>which</i> Sir William Wal- <lb/>
lace it was, lest we get the wrong one by the <lb/>
hassock;<ref target="n24"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n24" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>I am in some doubt as to what a hassock is, but any <lb/>
way it sounds good.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> this is the one "from whose patriot- <lb/>
ism and bravery comes that heart-stirring air, <lb/>
'Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled.'" Hannah <lb/>
More was related to her ancestors. She ex- <lb/>
plains who Hannah More was.</p>
<p>Whenever a person informs us who Sir Will- <lb/>
iam Wallace was, or who wrote "Hamlet," or <lb/>
where the Declaration of Independence was <lb/>
fought, it fills us with a suspicion wellnigh <lb/>
amounting to conviction, that that person <lb/>
would not suspect us of being so empty of <lb/>
knowledge if he wasn't suffering from the same <lb/>
"claim" himself. Then we turn to page 20 of <lb/>
<pb n="108"/>
the <i>Autobiography</i> and happen upon this pas- <lb/>
sage, and that hasty suspicion stands rebuked:</p>
<p>"I gained book-knowledge with far less labor <lb/>
than is usually requisite. At ten years of age <lb/>
I was as familiar with Lindley Murray's Gram- <lb/>
mar as with the Westminster Catechism; and <lb/>
the latter I had to repeat every Sunday. My <lb/>
favorite studies were Natural Philosophy, Log- <lb/>
ic, and Moral Science. From my brother Al- <lb/>
bert I received lessons in the ancient tongues, <lb/>
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin."</p>
<p>You catch your breath in astonishment, and <lb/>
feel again and still again the pang of that <lb/>
rebuke. But then your eye falls upon the <lb/>
next sentence but one, and the pain passes <lb/>
away and you set up the suspicion again with <lb/>
evil satisfaction:</p>
<p>"<i>After my discovery of Christian Science, <lb/>
most of the knowledge I had gleaned from school- <lb/>
books vanished like a dream</i>."</p>
<p>That disappearance accounts for much in her <lb/>
miscellaneous writings. As I was saying, she <lb/>
<pb n="109"/>
handles her "ancestral shadows," as she calls <lb/>
them, just as I do mine. It is remarkable. <lb/>
When she runs across "a relative of my Grand- <lb/>
father Baker, General Henry Knox, of Revo- <lb/>
lutionary fame," she sets him down; when she <lb/>
finds another good one, "the late Sir John <lb/>
Macneill, in the line of my Grandfather Baker's <lb/>
family," she sets him down, and remembers <lb/>
that he "was prominent in British politics, and <lb/>
at one time held the position of ambassador to <lb/>
Persia", when she discovers that her grand- <lb/>
parents "were likewise connected with Captain <lb/>
John Lovewell, whose gallant leadership and <lb/>
death in the Indian troubles of 1722&#x2013;25 caused <lb/>
that prolonged contest to be known historically <lb/>
as Lovewell's War," she sets the Captain down; <lb/>
when it turns out that a cousin of her grand- <lb/>
mother "was John Macneill, the New Hamp- <lb/>
shire general, who fought at Lundy's Lane and <lb/>
won distinction in 1814 at the battle of Chip- <lb/>
pewa," she catalogues the General. (And tells <lb/>
where Chippewa was.) And then she skips <i>all</i> <lb/>
her platform people; never mentions one of <lb/>
them. It shows that she is just as human as <lb/>
any of us.</p>
<pb n="110"/>
<p>Yet, after all, there is something very touch- <lb/>
ing in her pride in these worthy small-fry, and <lb/>
something large and fine in her modesty in not <lb/>
caring to remember that their kinship to her <lb/>
can confer no distinction upon her, whereas her <lb/>
mere mention of their names has conferred <lb/>
upon them a fadeless earthly immortality.</p>

<head><b><smcap>chapter ii</smcap></b></head>
<p><smcap>When</smcap> she wrote this little biography her <lb/>
great life-work had already been achieved, she <lb/>
was become renowned; to multitudes of reverent <lb/>
disciples she was a sacred personage, a familiar <lb/>
of God, and His inspired channel of communi- <lb/>
cation with the human race. Also, to them these <lb/>
following things were facts, and not doubted:</p>
<p>She had written a Bible in middle age, and <lb/>
had published it; she had recast it, enlarged it, <lb/>
and published it again; she had not stopped <lb/>
there, but had enlarged it further, polished its <lb/>
phrasing, improved its form, and published it <lb/>
yet again. It was at last become a compact, <lb/>
grammatical, dignified, and workman-like body <lb/>
of literature. This was good training, persist- <lb/>
ent training; and in all arts it is training that <lb/>
brings the art to perfection. We are now con- <lb/>
fronted with one of the most teasing and baf- <lb/>
fling riddles of Mrs. Eddy's history&#x2014;a riddle <lb/>
which may be formulated thus:</p>
<pb n="112"/>
<p>How is it that a primitive literary gun which <lb/>
began as a hundred-yard flint-lock smooth-bore <lb/>
muzzle-loader, and in the course of forty years <lb/>
has acquired one notable improvement after <lb/>
another&#x2014;percussion cap; fixed cartridge; rifled <lb/>
barrel; efficiency at half a mile&#x2014;how is it that <lb/>
such a gun, sufficiently good on an elephant- <lb/>
hunt (Christian Science) from the beginning, <lb/>
and growing better and better all the time dur- <lb/>
ing forty years, has <i>always</i> collapsed back to its <lb/>
original flint-lock estate the moment the hunt- <lb/>
ress trained it on any other creature than an <lb/>
elephant?</p>
<p>Something more than a generation ago Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy went out with her flint-lock on the rabbit- <lb/>
range, and this was a part of the result:</p>
<p>"After his decease, and a severe casualty <lb/>
deemed fatal by skilful physicians, we discov- <lb/>
ered that the Principle of all healing and the <lb/>
law that governs it is God, a divine Principle, <lb/>
and a spiritual not material law, and regained <lb/>
health."&#x2014;Preface to <i>Science and Health</i>, first <lb/>
revision, 1883.</p>
<p>N. B. Not from the book <i>itself;</i> from the <i>Preface</i>.</p>
<pb n="113"/>
<p>You will notice the awkwardness of that <lb/>
English. If you should carry that paragraph <lb/>
up to the Supreme Court of the United States <lb/>
in order to find out for good and all whether <lb/>
the fatal casualty happened to the dead man&#x2014; <lb/>
as the paragraph almost asserts&#x2014;or to some <lb/>
person or persons not even hinted at in the <lb/>
paragraph, the Supreme Court would be obliged <lb/>
to say that the evidence established nothing <lb/>
with certainty except that <i>there had been a cas- <lb/>
ualty</i>&#x2014;victim not known.</p>
<p>The context thinks it explains who the vic- <lb/>
tim was, but it does nothing of the kind. It <lb/>
furnishes some guessing-material of a sort which <lb/>
enables you to infer that it was "we" that suf- <lb/>
fered the mentioned injury, but if you should <lb/>
carry the language to a court you would not be <lb/>
able to prove that it necessarily meant that. <lb/>
"We" are Mrs. Eddy; a funny little affectation. <lb/>
She replaced it later with the more dignified <lb/>
third person.</p>
<p>The quoted paragraph is from Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
preface to the first revision of <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i> (1883). Sixty-four pages further along <lb/>
&#x2014;in the body of the book (the elephant-range), <lb/>
<pb n="114"/>
she went out with that same flint-lock and got <lb/>
this following result. Its English is very near- <lb/>
ly as straight and clean and competent as is the <lb/>
English of the latest revision of <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i> after the gun has been improved from <lb/>
smooth-bore musket up to globe-sighted, long- <lb/>
distance rifle:</p>
<p>"Man controlled by his Maker has no phys- <lb/>
ical suffering. His body is harmonious, his <lb/>
days are multiplying instead of diminishing, <lb/>
he is journeying towards Life instead of death, <lb/>
and bringing out the new man and crucifying <lb/>
the old affections, cutting them off in every <lb/>
material direction until he learns the utter su- <lb/>
premacy of Spirit and yields obedience there- <lb/>
to."</p>
<p>In the latest revision of <i>Science and Health</i> <lb/>
(1902), the perfected gun furnishes the follow- <lb/>
ing. The English is clean, compact, dignified, <lb/>
almost perfect. But it is observable that it is <lb/>
not prominently better than it is in the above <lb/>
paragraph, which was a product of the primitive <lb/>
flint-lock:</p>
<p>"How unreasonable is the belief that we are <lb/>
<pb n="115"/>
wearing out life and hastening to death, and <lb/>
at the same time we are communing with im- <lb/>
mortality? If the departed are in rapport with <lb/>
mortality, or matter, they are not spiritual, but <lb/>
must still be mortal, sinful, suffering, and dy- <lb/>
ing. Then wherefore look to them&#x2014;even were <lb/>
communication possible&#x2014;for proofs of immor- <lb/>
tality and accept them as oracles?"&#x2014;<i>Edition <lb/>
of</i> 1902, <i>page</i> 78.</p>
<p>With the above paragraphs compare these <lb/>
that follow. It is Mrs. Eddy writing&#x2014;after a <lb/>
good long twenty years of pen-practice. Com- <lb/>
pare also with the alleged Poems already <lb/>
quoted. The prominent characteristic of the <lb/>
Poems is affectation, artificiality; their make- <lb/>
up is a complacent and pretentious outpour of <lb/>
false figures and fine writing, in the sopho- <lb/>
moric style. The same qualities and the same <lb/>
style will be found, unchanged, unbettered, in <lb/>
these following paragraphs&#x2014;after a lapse of <lb/>
more than fifty years, and after&#x2014;as aforesaid <lb/>
&#x2014;long literary training. The italics are mine:</p>
<list>
<item>1. "What plague spot or bacilli were [<i>sic</i>] <lb/>
gnawing [<i>sic</i>] at the heart of this metropolis &#x2026; <lb/>
<pb n="116"/>
and bringing it [the heart] on bended knee? <lb/>
Why, it was an <i>institute</i> that had entered its <lb/>
<i>vitals</i>&#x2014;that, among other things, taught games," <lb/>
et cetera.&#x2014;<i>C. S. Journal</i>, p. 670, article entitled <lb/>
"A Narrative&#x2014;by Mary Baker G. Eddy."</item>
<item>2. "Parks sprang up [<i>sic</i>] &#x2026; electric-cars <lb/>
run [<i>sic</i>] merrily through several streets, con- <lb/>
crete sidewalks and macadamized roads dotted <lb/>
[<i>sic</i>] the place," et cetera.&#x2014;<i>Ibid.</i></item>
<item>3. "Shorn [<i>sic</i>] of its suburbs it had indeed <lb/>
little left to admire, save to [<i>sic</i>] such as fancy <lb/>
a skeleton above ground <i>breathing</i> [<i>sic</i>] slowly <lb/>
through a barren [<i>sic</i>] breast."&#x2014;<i>Ibid.</i></item>
</list>
<p>This is not English&#x2014;I mean, grown-up Eng- <lb/>
lish. But it is fifteen-year-old English, and has <lb/>
not grown a month since the same mind pro- <lb/>
duced the Poems. The standard of the Poems <lb/>
and of the plague-spot-and-bacilli effort is ex- <lb/>
actly the same. It is most strange that the <lb/>
same intellect that worded the simple and self- <lb/>
contained and clean-cut paragraph beginning <lb/>
with "How unreasonable is the belief," should <lb/>
in the very same lustrum discharge upon the <lb/>
world such a verbal chaos as the utterance <lb/>
concerning that plague-spot or bacilli which <lb/>
<pb n="117"/>
were gnawing at the insides of the metropolis <lb/>
and bringing its heart on bended knee, thus <lb/>
exposing to the eye the rest of the skeleton <lb/>
breathing slowly through a barren breast.</p>
<p>The immense contrast between the legitimate <lb/>
English of <i>Science and Health</i> and the bastard <lb/>
English of Mrs. Eddy's miscellaneous work, and <lb/>
between the maturity of the one diction and the <lb/>
juvenility of the other, suggests&#x2014;compels&#x2014; <lb/>
the question, Are there <i>two</i> guns? It would <lb/>
seem so. Is there a poor, foolish, old, scattering <lb/>
flint-lock for rabbit, and a long-range, centre- <lb/>
driving, up-to-date Mauser-magazine for ele- <lb/>
phant? It looks like it. For it is observable <lb/>
that in <i>Science and Health</i> (the elephant- <lb/>
ground) the practice was good at the start and <lb/>
has remained so, and that the practice in the <lb/>
miscellaneous, outside, small-game field was <lb/>
very bad at the start and was never less bad <lb/>
at any later time.</p>
<p>I wish to say that of Mrs. Eddy I am not re- <lb/>
quiring perfect English, but only good English. <lb/>
No one can write perfect English and keep it up <lb/>
through a stretch of ten chapters. It has never <lb/>
been done. It was approached in the "well of <lb/>
<pb n="118"/>
English undefiled"; it has been approached in <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy's Annex to that Book; it has been <lb/>
approached in several English grammars; I <lb/>
have even approached it myself; but none of <lb/>
us has made port.</p>
<p>Now, the English of <i>Science and Health</i> is <lb/>
good. In passages to be found in Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
<i>Autobiography</i> (on pages 53, 57, 101, and 113), <lb/>
and on page 6 of her squalid preface to <i>Science <lb/>
and Health</i>, first revision, she seems to me to <lb/>
claim the whole and sole authorship of the <lb/>
book. That she wrote the <i>Autobiography</i>, and <lb/>
<i>that preface</i>,<ref target="n25"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n25" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>See Appendix A for it.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> and the Poems, and the Plague- <lb/>
spot-Bacilli, we are not permitted to doubt. <lb/>
Indeed, we know she wrote them. But the <lb/>
very certainty that she wrote these things com- <lb/>
pels a doubt that she wrote <i>Science and Health</i>. <lb/>
She is guilty of little awkwardnesses of expres- <lb/>
sion in the <i>Autobiography</i> which a practised <lb/>
pen would hardly allow to go uncorrected in <lb/>
even a hasty private letter, and could not dream <lb/>
of passing by uncorrected in passages intended <lb/>
for print. But she passes them placidly by; as <lb/>
placidly as if she did not suspect that they were <lb/>
<pb n="119"/>
offences against third-class English. I think <lb/>
that that placidity was born of that very un- <lb/>
awareness, so to speak. I will cite a few in- <lb/>
stances from the <i>Autobiography</i>. The italics <lb/>
are mine:</p>
<p>"I remember reading in my childhood cer- <lb/>
tain manuscripts containing Scriptural Sonnets, <lb/>
besides <i>other</i> verses and enigmas," etc. Page 7.</p>
<p>[On page 27.] "Many pale cripples went <lb/>
into the Church leaning on crutches who came <lb/>
out carrying them on their shoulders."</p>
<p>It is awkward, because at the first glance it <lb/>
seems to say that the cripples went in leaning <lb/>
on crutches which went out carrying the crip- <lb/>
ples on their shoulders. It would have cost <lb/>
her no trouble to put her "who" after her <lb/>
"cripples." I blame her a little; I think her <lb/>
proof-reader should have been shot. We may <lb/>
let her capital C pass, but it is another awk- <lb/>
wardness, for she is talking about a building, <lb/>
not about a religious society.</p>
<p>"Marriage and Parentage" [Chapter-head- <lb/>
ing. Page 30]. You imagine that she is going <lb/>
to begin a talk about her marriage and finish <lb/>
<pb n="120"/>
with some account of her father and mother. <lb/>
And so you will be deceived. "Marriage" was <lb/>
right, but "Parentage" was not the best word <lb/>
for the rest of the record. It refers to the birth <lb/>
of her own child. After a certain period of <lb/>
time "my babe was born." Marriage and <lb/>
Motherhood&#x2014;Marriage and Maternity&#x2014;Mar- <lb/>
riage and Product&#x2014;Marriage and Dividend&#x2014; <lb/>
either of these would have fitted the facts and <lb/>
made the matter clear.</p>
<p>"Without my knowledge he was appointed <lb/>
a guardian." Page 32.</p>
<p>She is speaking of her child. She means that <lb/>
a guardian <i>for</i> her child was appointed, but <lb/>
that isn't what she says.</p>
<p>"If spiritual conclusions are separated from <lb/>
their premises, the nexus is lost, and the argu- <lb/>
ment with its rightful conclusions, becomes <lb/>
correspondingly obscure." Page 34.</p>
<p>We shall never know why she put the word <lb/>
"correspondingly" in there. Any fine, large <lb/>
word would have answered just as well: psycho- <lb/>

superintangibly&#x2014;electroincandescently&#x2014;oli- <lb/>
garcheologically&#x2014;sanchrosynchrostereoptical- <lb/>
ly&#x2014;any of these would have answered, any of <lb/>
these would have filled the void.</p>
<p>"His spiritual noumenon and phenomenon <lb/>
silenced portraiture." Page 34.</p>
<p>Yet she says she forgot everything she knew, <lb/>
when she discovered Christian Science. I real- <lb/>
ize that noumenon is a daisy; and I will not <lb/>
deny that I shall use it whenever I am in a com- <lb/>
pany which I think I can embarrass with it; <lb/>
but, at the same time, I think it is out of place <lb/>
among friends in an autobiography. There, I <lb/>
think a person ought not to have anything up <lb/>
his sleeve. It undermines confidence. But <lb/>
my dissatisfaction with the quoted passage is <lb/>
not on account of noumenon; it is on account of <lb/>
the misuse of the word "silenced." You can- <lb/>
not silence portraiture with a noumenon; if <lb/>
portraiture should make a noise, a way could be <lb/>
found to silence it, but even then it could not <lb/>
be done with a noumenon. Not even with a <lb/>
brick, some authorities think.</p>

<p>"It may be that the mortal life-battle still <lb/>
wages," etc. Page 35.</p>
<p>That is clumsy. Battles do not wage, bat- <lb/>
tles are waged. Mrs. Eddy has one very curi- <lb/>
ous and interesting peculiarity: whenever she <lb/>
notices that she is chortling along without say- <lb/>
ing anything, she pulls up with a sudden "God <lb/>
is over us all," or some other sounding irrele <lb/>
vancy, and for the moment it seems to light up <lb/>
the whole district; then, before you can recover <lb/>
from the shock, she goes flitting pleasantly and <lb/>
meaninglessly along again, and you hurry hope- <lb/>
fully after her, thinking you are going to get <lb/>
something this time; but as soon as she has led <lb/>
you far enough away from her turkeylet she <lb/>
takes to a tree. Whenever she discovers that <lb/>
she is getting pretty disconnected, she couples- <lb/>
up with an ostentatious "<i>But</i>" which has noth- <lb/>
ing to do with anything that went before or is <lb/>
to come after, then she hitches some empties to <lb/>
the train&#x2014;unrelated verses from the Bible, usu- <lb/>
ally&#x2014;and steams out of sight and leaves you <lb/>
wondering how she did that clever thing. For <lb/>
striking instances, see bottom paragraph on <lb/>
<pb n="123"/>
page 34 and the paragraph on page 35 of her <lb/>
<i>Autobiography</i>. She has a purpose&#x2014;a deep and <lb/>
dark and artful purpose&#x2014;in what she is saying <lb/>
in the first paragraph, and you guess what it is, <lb/>
but that is due to your own talent, not hers; <lb/>
she has made it as obscure as language could <lb/>
do it. The other paragraph has no meaning <lb/>
and no discoverable intention. It is merely <lb/>
one of her God-over-alls. I cannot spare room <lb/>
for it in this place.<ref target="n26"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n26" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>See Appendix B.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></p>
<p>"I beheld with ineffable awe our great Mas- <lb/>
ter's marvellous skill in demanding neither <lb/>
obedience to hygienic laws nor," etc. Page 41.</p>
<p>The word is loosely chosen&#x2014;skill. She <lb/>
probably meant judgment, intuition, penetra- <lb/>
tion, or wisdom.</p>
<p>"Naturally, my first jottings were but efforts <lb/>
to express in feeble diction Truth's ultimate." <lb/>
Page 42.</p>
<p>One understands what she means, but she <lb/>
should have been able to say what she meant&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="124"/>
at any time before she discovered Christian <lb/>
Science and forgot everything she knew&#x2014;and <lb/>
after it, too. If she had put "feeble" in front <lb/>
of "efforts" and then left out "in" and "die- <lb/>
tion," she would have scored.</p>
<p>"&#x2026; its written expression increases in per- <lb/>
fection under the guidance of the great Mas- <lb/>
ter." Page 43.</p>
<p>It is an error. Not even in those advanta- <lb/>
geous circumstances can increase be added to <lb/>
perfection.</p>
<p>"Evil is not mastered by evil; it can only be <lb/>
overcome with Good. This brings out the <lb/>
nothingness of evil, and the eternal Something- <lb/>
ness vindicates the Divine Principle and im- <lb/>
proves the race of Adam." Page 76.</p>
<p>This is too extraneous for me. That is the <lb/>
trouble with Mrs. Eddy when she sets out <lb/>
to explain an over-large exhibit: the min- <lb/>
ute you think the light is bursting upon you <lb/>
the candle goes out and your mind begins to <lb/>
wander.</p>
<pb n="125"/>
<p>"No one else can drain the cup which I have <lb/>
drunk to the dregs, as the discoverer and teacher <lb/>
of Christian Science." Page 47.</p>
<p>That is saying we cannot empty an empty <lb/>
cup. We knew it before; and we know she <lb/>
meant to tell us that that particular cup is go- <lb/>
ing to remain empty. That is, we think that <lb/>
that was the idea, but we cannot be sure. She <lb/>
has a perfectly astonishing talent for putting <lb/>
words together in such a way as to make <lb/>
successful inquiry into their intention im- <lb/>
possible.</p>
<p>She generally makes us uneasy when she be- <lb/>
gins to tune up on her fine-writing timbrel. It <lb/>
carries me back to her Plague-Spot and Poetry <lb/>
days, and I just dread those:</p>
<p>"Into mortal mind's material obliquity I <lb/>
gazed and stood abashed. Blanched was the <lb/>
cheek of pride. My heart bent low before the <lb/>
omnipotence of Spirit, and a tint of humility <lb/>
soft as the heart of a moonbeam mantled the <lb/>
earth. Bethlehem and Bethany, Gethsemane <lb/>
and Calvary, spoke to my chastened sense as <lb/>
by the tearful lips of a babe." Page 48.</p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p>The heart of a moonbeam is a pretty enough <lb/>
Friendship's - Album expression&#x2014;let it pass, <lb/>
though I do think the figure a little strained; <lb/>
but humility has no tint, humility has no com- <lb/>
plexion, and if it had it could not mantle the <lb/>
earth. A moonbeam might&#x2014;I do not know&#x2014; <lb/>
but she did not say it was the moonbeam. But <lb/>
let it go, I cannot decide it, she mixes me up so. <lb/>
A babe hasn't "tearful lips," it's its eyes. You <lb/>
find none of Mrs. Eddy's kind of English in <lb/>
<i>Science and Health</i>&#x2014;not a line of it.</p>

<p><smcap>Setting</smcap> aside title-page, index, etc., the little <lb/>
<i>Autobiography</i> begins on page 7 and ends on <lb/>
page 130. My quotations are from the first <lb/>
forty pages. They seem to me to prove the <lb/>
presence of the 'prentice hand. The style of <lb/>
the forty pages is loose and feeble and 'pren- <lb/>
tice-like. The movement of the narrative is <lb/>
not orderly and sequential, but rambles around, <lb/>
and skips forward and back and here and there <lb/>
and yonder, 'prentice-fashion. Many a jour- <lb/>
neyman has broken up his narrative and <lb/>
skipped about and rambled around, but he did <lb/>
it for a purpose, for an advantage; there was <lb/>
art in it, and points to be scored by it; the ob- <lb/>
servant reader perceived the game, and en- <lb/>
joyed it and respected it, if it was well <lb/>
played. But Mrs. Eddy's performance was <lb/>
without intention, and destitute of art. She <lb/>
could score no points by it on those terms, <lb/>
and almost any reader can see that her <lb/>
<pb n="128"/>
work was the uncalculated puttering of a <lb/>
novice.</p>
<p>In the above paragraph I have described the <lb/>
first third of the booklet. That third being <lb/>
completed, Mrs. Eddy leaves the rabbit-range, <lb/>
crosses the frontier, and steps out upon her <lb/>
far - spreading big - game territory&#x2014;Christian <lb/>
Science&#x2014;and there is an instant change! The <lb/>
style smartly improves, and the clumsy little <lb/>
technical offences disappear. In these two- <lb/>
thirds of the booklet I find only one such of- <lb/>
fence, and it has the look of being a printer's <lb/>
error.</p>
<p>I leave the riddle with the reader. Perhaps <lb/>
he can explain how it is that a person&#x2014;trained <lb/>
or untrained&#x2014;who on the one day can write <lb/>
nothing better than Plague-Spot-Bacilli and <lb/>
feeble and stumbling and wandering personal <lb/>
history littered with false figures and obscu- <lb/>
rities and technical blunders, can on the next <lb/>
day sit down and write fluently, smoothly, <lb/>
compactly, capably, and confidently on a great <lb/>
big thundering subject, and do it as easily and <lb/>
comfortably as a whale paddles around the <lb/>
globe.</p>
<pb n="129"/>
<p>As for me, I have scribbled so much in fifty <lb/>
years that I have become saturated with con- <lb/>
victions of one sort and another concerning a <lb/>
scribbler's limitations; and these are so strong <lb/>
that when I am familiar with a literary per- <lb/>
son's work I feel perfectly sure that I know <lb/>
enough about his limitations to know what he <lb/>
can <i>not</i> do. If Mr. Howells should pretend to <lb/>
me that he wrote the Plague - Spot - Bacilli <lb/>
rhapsody, I should receive the statement cour- <lb/>
teously, but I should know it for a&#x2014;well, for a <lb/>
perversion. If the late Josh Billings should <lb/>
rise up and tell me that he wrote Herbert <lb/>
Spencer's philosophies, I should answer and <lb/>
say that the spelling casts a doubt upon his <lb/>
claim. If the late Jonathan Edwards should <lb/>
rise up and tell me he wrote Mr. Dooley's books, <lb/>
I should answer and say that the marked differ- <lb/>
ence between his style and Dooley's is argu- <lb/>
ment against the soundness of his statement. <lb/>
You see how much I think of <i>circumstantial <lb/>
evidence</i>. In literary matters&#x2014;in my belief&#x2014; <lb/>
it is often better than any person's word, better <lb/>
than any shady character's oath. It is diffi- <lb/>
cult for me to believe that the same hand that <lb/>
<pb n="130"/>
wrote the Plague-Spot-Bacilli and the first <lb/>
third of the little Eddy biography wrote also <lb/>
<i>Science and Health</i>. Indeed, it is more than <lb/>
difficult, it is impossible.</p>
<p>Largely speaking, I have read acres of what <lb/>
purported to be Mrs. Eddy's writings, in the <lb/>
past two months. I cannot know, but I am <lb/>
convinced, that the circumstantial evidence <lb/>
shows that her actual share in the work of com- <lb/>
posing and phrasing these things was so slight <lb/>
as to be inconsequential. Where she puts her <lb/>
literary foot down, her trail across her paid pol- <lb/>
isher's page is as plain as the elephant's in a <lb/>
Sunday-school procession. Her verbal output, <lb/>
when left undoctored by her clerks, is quite <lb/>
unmistakable. It always exhibits the strong- <lb/>
ly distinctive features observable in the virgin <lb/>
passages from her pen already quoted by me:</p>
<list>
<item>Desert vacancy, as regards thought.</item>
<item>Self-complacency.</item>
<item>Puerility.</item>
<item>Sentimentality.</item>
<item>Affectations of scholarly learning.</item>
<item>Lust after eloquent and flowery expression.</item>
<item>Repetition of pet poetic picturesquenesses.</item>
<pb n="131"/>
<item>Confused and wandering statement.</item>
<item>Metaphor gone insane.</item>
<item>Meaningless words, used because they are <lb/>
pretty, or showy, or unusual.</item>
<item>Sorrowful attempts at the epigrammatic.</item>
<item>Destitution of originality.</item>
</list>
<p>The fat volume called <i>Miscellaneous Writ- <lb/>
ings of Mrs. Eddy</i> contains several hundred <lb/>
pages. Of the five hundred and fifty - four <lb/>
pages of prose in it I find ten lines, on page <lb/>
319, to be Mrs. Eddy's; also about a page of <lb/>
the preface or "Prospectus"; also about fif- <lb/>
teen pages scattered along through the book. <lb/>
If she wrote any of the rest of the prose, it was <lb/>
rewritten after her by another hand. Here I <lb/>
will insert two-thirds of her page of the pros- <lb/>
pectus. It is evident that whenever, under <lb/>
the inspiration of the Deity, she turns out a <lb/>
book, she is always allowed to do some of the <lb/>
preface. I wonder why that is? It always <lb/>
mars the work. I think it is done in humor- <lb/>
ous malice. I think the clerks like to see her <lb/>
give herself away. They know she will, her <lb/>
stock of usable materials being limited and her <lb/>
procedure in employing them always the same, <lb/>
<pb n="132"/>
substantially. They know that when the ini- <lb/>
tiated come upon her first erudite allusion, or <lb/>
upon any one of her other stage-properties, <lb/>
they can shut their eyes and tell what will fol- <lb/>
low. She usually throws off an easy remark <lb/>
all sodden with Greek or Hebrew or Latin learn- <lb/>
ing; she usually has a person watching for a <lb/>
star&#x2014;she can seldom get away from that poetic <lb/>
idea&#x2014;sometimes it is a Chaldee, sometimes a <lb/>
Walking Delegate, sometimes an entire stran- <lb/>
ger, but be he what he may, he is generally <lb/>
there when the train is ready to move, and has <lb/>
his pass in his hat-band; she generally has a <lb/>
Being with a Dome on him, or some other cover <lb/>
that is unusual and out of the fashion; she likes <lb/>
to fire off a Scripture-verse where it will make <lb/>
the handsomest noise and come nearest to <lb/>
breaking the connection; she often throws out <lb/>
a Forefelt, or a Foresplendor, or a Foreslander <lb/>
where it will have a fine nautical foreto'gallant <lb/>
sound and make the sentence sing; after which <lb/>
she is nearly sure to throw discretion away and <lb/>
take to her deadly passion, Intoxicated Meta- <lb/>
phor. At such a time the Mrs. Eddy that does <lb/>
not hesitate is lost:</p>
<pb n="133"/>
<p>"The ancient Greek looked longingly for the <lb/>
Olympiad. The Chaldee watched the appear- <lb/>
ing of a star; to him no higher destiny dawned <lb/>
on the dome of being than that foreshadowed <lb/>
by signs in the heavens. The meek Nazarene, <lb/>
the scoffed of all scoffers, said, 'Ye can discern <lb/>
the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the <lb/>
signs of the times?'&#x2014;for He forefelt and fore- <lb/>
saw the ordeal of a perfect Christianity, hated <lb/>
by sinners.</p>
<p>"To kindle all minds with a gleam of grati- <lb/>
tude, the new idea that comes welling up from <lb/>
infinite Truth needs to be understood. The <lb/>
seer of this age should be a sage.</p>
<p>"Humility is the stepping-stone to a higher <lb/>
recognition of Deity. The mounting sense <lb/>
gathers fresh forms and strange fire from the <lb/>
ashes of dissolving self, and drops the world. <lb/>
Meekness heightens immortal attributes, only <lb/>
by removing the dust that dims them. Good- <lb/>
ness reveals another scene and another self <lb/>
seemingly rolled up in shades, but brought to <lb/>
light by the evolutions of advancing thought, <lb/>
whereby we discern the power of Truth and <lb/>
Love to heal the sick.</p>
<p>"Pride is ignorance; those assume most who <lb/>
have the least wisdom or experience; and they <lb/>
<pb n="134"/>
steal from their neighbor, because they have so <lb/>
little of their own."&#x2014;<i>Miscellaneous Writings</i>, <lb/>
page 1, and six lines at top of page 2.</p>
<p>It is not believable that the hand that wrote <lb/>
those clumsy and affected sentences wrote the <lb/>
smooth English of <i>Science and Health</i>.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IV">
<pb/>
<head><b><smcap>chapter iv</smcap></b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> is often said in print that Mrs. Eddy claims <lb/>
that God was the Author of <i>Science and Health</i>. <lb/>
Mr. Peabody states in his pamphlet that "she <lb/>
says not she but God was the Author." I can- <lb/>
not find that in her autobiography she makes <lb/>
this transference of the authorship, but I think <lb/>
that in it she definitely claims that she did her <lb/>
work under His inspiration&#x2014;definitely for her; <lb/>
for as a rule she is not a very definite person, <lb/>
even when she seems to be trying her best to <lb/>
be clear and positive. Speaking of the early <lb/>
days when her Science was beginning to unfold <lb/>
itself and gather form in her mind, she says <lb/>
(<i>Autobiography</i>, page 43):</p>
<p>"The divine hand led me into a new world of <lb/>
light and Life, a fresh universe&#x2014;old to God, <lb/>
but new to His 'little one.'"</p>
<p>She being His little one, as I understand it.</p>
<pb n="136"/>
<p>The divine hand led her. It seems to mean <lb/>
"God inspired me"; but when a person uses <lb/>
metaphors instead of statistics&#x2014;and that is <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy's common fashion&#x2014;one cannot al- <lb/>
ways feel sure about the intention.</p>
<p>[Page 56.] "Even the Scripture gave no <lb/>
direct interpretation of the Scientific basis for <lb/>
demonstrating the spiritual Principle of heal- <lb/>
ing, until our Heavenly Father saw fit, through <lb/>
the <i>Key to the Scriptures</i>, in <i>Science and Health</i>, <lb/>
to unlock this 'mystery of godliness.'"</p>
<p>Another baffling metaphor. If she had used <lb/>
plain forecastle English, and said "God wrote <lb/>
the <i>Key</i> and I put it in my book"; or if she had <lb/>
said "God furnished me the solution of the <lb/>
mystery and I put it on paper"; or if she had <lb/>
said "God did it all," then we should under- <lb/>
stand; but her phrase is open to any and all of <lb/>
those translations, and is a Key which unlocks <lb/>
nothing&#x2014;for us. However, it seems to at <lb/>
least mean "God inspired me," if nothing <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>There was personal and intimate commun- <lb/>
ion, at any rate&#x2014;we get that much out of the <lb/>
<pb n="137"/>
riddles. The connection extended to business, <lb/>
after the establishment of the teaching and <lb/>
healing industry.</p>
<p>[Page 71.] "When God impelled me to set <lb/>
a price on my instruction," etc. Further down: <lb/>
"God has since shown me, in multitudinous <lb/>
ways, the wisdom of this decision."</p>
<p>She was not able to think of a "financial <lb/>
equivalent"&#x2014;meaning a pecuniary equivalent <lb/>
&#x2014;for her "instruction in Christian Science <lb/>
Mind-healing." In this emergency she was <lb/>
"led" to charge three hundred dollars for a <lb/>
term of "twelve half-days." She does not say <lb/>
who led her, she only says that the amount <lb/>
greatly troubled her. I think it means that <lb/>
the price was suggested from above, "led" be- <lb/>
ing a theological term identical with our com- <lb/>
mercial phrase "personally conducted." She <lb/>
"shrank from asking it, but was finally led, by <lb/>
a strange providence, to accept this fee." <lb/>
"Providence" is another theological term. <lb/>
Two leds and a providence, taken together, <lb/>
make a pretty strong argument for inspiration. <lb/>
I think that these statistics make it clear that <lb/>
<pb n="138"/>
the price was arranged above. This view is <lb/>
constructively supported by the fact, already <lb/>
quoted, that God afterwards approved, "in <lb/>
multitudinous ways," her wisdom in accepting <lb/>
the mentioned fee. "Multitudinous ways"&#x2014; <lb/>
multitudinous encoring&#x2014;suggests enthusiasm. <lb/>
Business enthusiasm. And it suggests near- <lb/>
ness. God's nearness to his "little one." Near- <lb/>
ness, and a watchful personal interest. A <lb/>
warm, palpitating, Standard - Oil interest, so <lb/>
to speak. All this indicates inspiration. We <lb/>
may assume, then, two inspirations: one for the <lb/>
book, the other for the business.</p>
<p>The evidence for inspiration is further aug- <lb/>
mented by the testimony of Rev. George Tom- <lb/>
kins, D.D., already quoted, that Mrs. Eddy and <lb/>
her book were foretold in Revelation, and <lb/>
that Mrs. Eddy "<i>is</i> God's brightest thought to <lb/>
this age, giving us the spiritual interpretation <lb/>
of the Bible in the 'little book'" of the Angel.</p>
<p>I am aware that it is not Mr. Tomkins that is <lb/>
speaking, but Mrs. Eddy. The commissioned <lb/>
lecturers of the Christian Science Church have <lb/>
to be members of the Board of Lectureship. <lb/>
(By-laws, Sec. 2, p. 70.) The Board of Lect- <lb/>
<pb n="139"/>
ureship is selected by the Board of Directors <lb/>
of the Church. (By-laws, Sec. 3, p. 70.) The <lb/>
Board of Directors of the Church is the prop- <lb/>
erty of Mrs. Eddy. (By - laws, p. 22.) Mr. <lb/>
Tomkins did not make that statement with- <lb/>
out authorization from headquarters. He nec- <lb/>
essarily got it from the Board of Directors, <lb/>
the Board of Directors from Mrs. Eddy, Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy from the Deity. Mr. Tomkins would <lb/>
have been turned down by that procession if <lb/>
his remarks had been unsatisfactory to it.</p>
<p>It may be that there is evidence somewhere <lb/>
&#x2014;as has been claimed&#x2014;that Mrs. Eddy has <lb/>
charged upon the Deity the verbal authorship <lb/>
of <i>Science and Health</i>. But if she ever made <lb/>
the charge, she has withdrawn it (as it seems <lb/>
to me), and in the most formal and unqualified <lb/>
of all ways. See <i>Autobiography</i>, page 57:</p>
<p>"When the demand for this book increased <lb/>
&#x2026; the copyright was infringed. I entered a <lb/>
suit at Law, and my copyright was protected."</p>
<p>Thus it is plain that she did not plead that <lb/>
the Deity was the (verbal) Author; for if she <lb/>
<pb n="140"/>
had done that, she would have lost her case&#x2014; <lb/>
and with rude promptness. It was in the old <lb/>
days before the Berne Convention and before <lb/>
the passage of our amended law of 1891, and <lb/>
the court would have quoted the following <lb/>
stern clause from the existing statute and <lb/>
frowned her out of the place:</p>
<p>"No Foreigner can acquire copyright in the <lb/>
United States."</p>
<p>To sum up. The evidence before me indi- <lb/>
cates three things:</p>
<list>
<item>1. That Mrs. Eddy claims the verbal author- <lb/>
ship for herself.</item>
<item>2. That she denies it to the Deity.</item>
<item>3. That&#x2014;in her belief&#x2014;she wrote the book <lb/>
under the inspiration of the Deity, but fur- <lb/>
nished the language herself.</item>
</list>
<p>In one place in the <i>Autobiography</i> she claims <lb/>
both the language and the <i>ideas;</i> but when this <lb/>
witness is testifying, one must draw the line <lb/>
somewhere, or she will prove both sides of her <lb/>
case&#x2014;nine sides, if desired.</p>
<p>It is too true. Much too true. Many, many <lb/>
times too true. She is a most trying witness&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>the</i> most trying witness that ever kissed the <lb/>
<pb n="141"/>
Book, I am sure. There is no keeping up with <lb/>
her erratic testimony. As soon as you have <lb/>
got her share of the authorship nailed where <lb/>
you half hope and half believe it will stay and <lb/>
cannot be joggled loose any more, she joggles it <lb/>
loose again&#x2014;or seems to; you cannot be sure, <lb/>
for her habit of dealing in meaningless meta- <lb/>
phors instead of in plain, straightforward sta- <lb/>
tistics, makes it nearly always impossible to tell <lb/>
just what it is she is trying to say. She was <lb/>
definite when she claimed both the language <lb/>
and the ideas of the book. That seemed to <lb/>
settle the matter. It seemed to distribute the <lb/>
percentages of credit with precision between <lb/>
the collaborators: ninety-two per cent. to Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy, who did all the work, and eight per cent. <lb/>
to the Deity, who furnished the inspiration&#x2014; <lb/>
not enough of it to damage the copyright in <lb/>
a country closed against Foreigners, and yet <lb/>
plenty to advertise the book and market it at <lb/>
famine rates. Then Mrs. Eddy does not keep <lb/>
still, but fetches around and comes forward <lb/>
and testifies again. It is most injudicious. For <lb/>
she resorts to metaphor this time, and it makes <lb/>
trouble, for she seems to reverse the percent- <lb/>
<pb n="142"/>
ages and claim only the eight per cent. for her <lb/>
self. I quote from Mr. Peabody's book (<i>Eddy- <lb/>
ism, or Christian Science</i>. Boston: 15 Court <lb/>
Square, price twenty-five cents):</p>
<p>"Speaking of this book, Mrs. Eddy, in Jan- <lb/>
uary last (1901) said: 'I should blush to write <lb/>
of <i>Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures</i>, <lb/>
as I have, were it of human origin, and I, apart <lb/>
from God, its author; but as I was only a scribe <lb/>
echoing the harmonies of Heaven in divine <lb/>
metaphysics, I cannot be supermodest of the <lb/>
Christian Science text-book.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Peabody's comment:</p>
<p>"Nothing could be plainer than that. Here <lb/>
is a distinct avowal that the book entitled <lb/>
<i>Science and Health</i> was the work of Almighty <lb/>
God."</p>
<p>It does seem to amount to that. She was <lb/>
only a "scribe." Confound the word, it is just <lb/>
a confusion, it has no determinable meaning <lb/>
there, it leaves us in the air. A scribe is merely <lb/>
a person who writes. He may be a copyist, <lb/>
<pb n="143"/>
he may be an amanuensis, he may be a writer <lb/>
of originals, and furnish both the language and <lb/>
the ideas. As usual with Mrs. Eddy, the con- <lb/>
nection affords no help&#x2014;"echoing" throws no <lb/>
light upon "scribe." A rock can reflect an <lb/>
echo, a wall can do it, a mountain can do it, <lb/>
many things can do it, but a scribe can't. A <lb/>
scribe that could reflect an echo could get over <lb/>
thirty dollars a week in a side-show. Many <lb/>
impresarios would rather have him than a cow <lb/>
with four tails. If we allow that this present <lb/>
scribe was <i>setting down</i> the "harmonies of <lb/>
Heaven"&#x2014;and certainly that seems to have <lb/>
been the case&#x2014;then there was only one way to <lb/>
do it that I can think of: listen to the music <lb/>
and put down the notes one after another as <lb/>
they fell. In that case Mrs. Eddy did not in- <lb/>
vent the tune, she only entered it on paper. <lb/>
Therefore&#x2014;dropping the metaphor&#x2014;she was <lb/>
merely an amanuensis, and furnished neither <lb/>
the language of <i>Science and Health</i> nor the <lb/>
ideas. It reduces her to eight per cent. (and <lb/>
the dividends on that and the rest).</p>
<p>Is that it? We shall never know. For Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy is liable to testify again at any time. But <lb/>
<pb n="144"/>
until she does it, I think we must conclude that <lb/>
the Deity was Author of the whole book, and <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy merely His telephone and stenog- <lb/>
rapher. Granting this, her claim as the Voice <lb/>
of God stands&#x2014;for the present&#x2014;justified and <lb/>
established.</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>Postscript</smcap></head>
<p>I overlooked something. It appears that <lb/>
there was more of that utterance than Mr. Pea- <lb/>
body has quoted in the above paragraph. It <lb/>
will be found in Mrs. Eddy's organ, the <i>Chris- <lb/>
tian Science Journal</i> (January, 1901) and reads <lb/>
as follows:</p>
<p>"It was not myself &#x2026; which dictated <i>Science <lb/>
and Health, with Key to the Scriptures</i>."</p>
<p>That is certainly clear enough. The words <lb/>
which I have removed from that important sen- <lb/>
tence explain Who it was that did the dictating. <lb/>
It was done by</p>
<p>"the divine power of Truth and Love, in- <lb/>
finitely above me."</p>
<pb n="145"/>
<p>Certainly that is definite. At last, through <lb/>
her personal testimony, we have a sure grip <lb/>
upon the following vital facts, and they settle <lb/>
the authorship of <i>Science and Health</i> beyond <lb/>
peradventure:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Mrs. Eddy furnished "the ideas and the <lb/>
language."</item>
<item>2. God furnished the ideas and the language.</item>
</list>
<p>It is a great comfort to have the matter au- <lb/>
thoritatively settled.</p>

<p><smcap>It</smcap> is hard to locate her, she shifts about so <lb/>
much. She is a shining drop of quicksilver <lb/>
which you put your finger on and it isn't there. <lb/>
There is a paragraph in the <i>Autobiography</i> <lb/>
(page 96) which places in seemingly darkly sig- <lb/>
nificant procession three Personages:</p>
<list>
<item>1. The Virgin Mary.</item>
<item>2. Jesus of Nazareth.</item>
<item>3. Mrs. Eddy.</item>
</list>
<p>This is the paragraph referred to:</p>
<p>"No person can take the individual place of <lb/>
the Virgin Mary. No person can compass or <lb/>
fulfil the individual mission of Jesus of Naza- <lb/>
reth. No person can take the place of the au- <lb/>
thor of <i>Science and Health</i>, the discoverer and <lb/>
founder of Christian Science. Each individual <lb/>
must fill his own niche in time and eternity."</p>
<p>I have read it many times, but I still cannot <lb/>
be sure that I rightly understand it. If the <lb/>
<pb n="147"/>
Saviour's name had been placed first and the <lb/>
Virgin Mary's second and Mrs. Eddy's third, I <lb/>
should draw the inference that a descending <lb/>
scale from First Importance to Second Im- <lb/>
portance and then to Small Importance was <lb/>
indicated; but to place the Virgin first, the <lb/>
Saviour second, and Mrs. Eddy third, seems to <lb/>
turn the scale the other way and make it an <lb/>
ascending scale of Importances, with Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
ranking the other two and holding first place.</p>
<p>I think that that was perhaps the intention, <lb/>
but none but a seasoned Christian Scientist <lb/>
can examine a literary animal of Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
creation and tell which end of it the tail is on. <lb/>
She is easily the most baffling and bewildering <lb/>
writer in the literary trade.</p>
<p><smcap>Eddy</smcap> is a commonplace name, and would <lb/>
have an unimpressive aspect in the list of the <lb/>
reformed Holy Family. She has thought of <lb/>
that. In the book of By-laws written by her <lb/>
&#x2014;"impelled by a power not one's own"&#x2014;there <lb/>
is a paragraph which explains how and when <lb/>
her disciples came to confer a title upon her; <lb/>
<pb n="148"/>
and this explanation is followed by a warning <lb/>
as to what will happen to any female Scientist <lb/>
who shall desecrate it:</p>
<p>"<i>The title of Mother</i>. Therefore if a student <lb/>
of Christian Science shall apply this title, either <lb/>
to herself or to others, except as the term for <lb/>
kinship according to the flesh, it shall be re- <lb/>
garded by the Church as an indication of disre- <lb/>
spect for their Pastor Emeritus, and unfitness <lb/>
to be a member of the Mother-Church."</p>
<p>She is the Pastor Emeritus.</p>
<p>While the quoted paragraph about the Pro- <lb/>
cession seems to indicate that Mrs. Eddy is <lb/>
expecting to occupy the First Place in it, that <lb/>
expectation is not definitely avowed. In an <lb/>
earlier utterance of hers she is clearer&#x2014;clearer, <lb/>
and does not claim the first place all to herself, <lb/>
but only the half of it. I quote from Mr. <lb/>
Peabody's book again:</p>
<p>"In the <i>Christian Science Journal</i> for April, <lb/>
1889, when it was her property, and published <lb/>
by her, it was claimed for her, and <i>with her <lb/>
sanction</i>, that she was equal with Jesus, and <lb/>
<pb n="149"/>
elaborate effort was made to establish the <lb/>
claim.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Eddy has distinctly <i>authorized</i> the <lb/>
claim in her behalf that she herself was the <lb/>
chosen successor to and equal of Jesus."</p>
<p>In her <i>Miscellaneous Writings</i> (using her once <lb/>
favorite "We" for "I") she says that "While <lb/>
we entertain decided views &#x2026; and shall express <lb/>
them as duty demands, we shall claim no espe- <lb/>
cial gift from our divine origin," etc.</p>
<p>Our divine origin. It suggests Equal again. <lb/>
It is inferable, then, that in the near by-and-by <lb/>
the new Church will officially rank the Holy <lb/>
Family in the following order:</p>
<list>
<item>1. Jesus of Nazareth.&#x2014;1. Our Mother.</item>
<item>2. The Virgin Mary.</item>
</list>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>Summary</smcap></head>
<p>I am not playing with Christian Science and <lb/>
its founder, I am examining them; and I am do- <lb/>
ing it because of the interest I feel in the in- <lb/>
quiry. My results may seem inadequate to the <lb/>
reader, but they have for me clarified a muddle <lb/>
<pb n="150"/>
and brought a sort of order out of a chaos, and <lb/>
so I value them.</p>
<p>My readings of Mrs. Eddy's uninspired mis- <lb/>
cellaneous literary efforts have convinced me <lb/>
of several things:</p>
<list>
<item>1. That she did not write <i>Science and Health</i>.</item>
<item>2. That the Deity did (or did not) write it.</item>
<item>3. That She thinks She wrote it.</item>
<item>4. That She believes She wrote it under the <lb/>
Deity's inspiration.</item>
<item>5. That She believes She is a Member of the <lb/>
Holy Family.</item>
<item>6. That She believes She is the equal of the <lb/>
Head of it.</item>
</list>
<p>Finally, I think She is now entitled to the <lb/>
capital S&#x2014;on her own evidence.</p>

<head><b><smcap>chapter vi</smcap></b></head>
<p><smcap>Thus</smcap> far we have a part of Mrs. Eddy's por- <lb/>
trait. Not made of fictions, surmises, reports, <lb/>
rumors, innuendoes, dropped by her enemies; <lb/>
no, she has furnished all of the materials herself, <lb/>
and laid them on the canvas, under my general <lb/>
superintendence and direction. As far as she <lb/>
has gone with it, it is the presentation of a com- <lb/>
placent, commonplace, illiterate New England <lb/>
woman who "forgot everything she knew" <lb/>
when she discovered her discovery, then wrote <lb/>
a Bible in good English under the inspiration of <lb/>
God, and climbed up it to the supremest sum- <lb/>
mit of earthly grandeur attainable by man&#x2014; <lb/>
where she sits serene to-day, beloved and wor- <lb/>
shipped by a multitude of human beings of as <lb/>
good average intelligence as is possessed by <lb/>
those that march under the banner of any com- <lb/>
peting cult. This is not intended to flatter the <lb/>
competing cults, it is merely a statement of cold <lb/>
fact.</p>
<pb n="152"/>
<p>That a commonplace person should go climb- <lb/>
ing aloft and become a god or a half-god or a <lb/>
quarter-god and be worshipped by men and <lb/>
women of average intelligence, is nothing. It <lb/>
has happened a million times, it will happen a <lb/>
hundred million more. It has been millions of <lb/>
years since the first of these supernaturals ap- <lb/>
peared, and by the time the last one&#x2014;in that <lb/>
inconceivably remote future&#x2014;shall have per- <lb/>
formed his solemn little high-jinks on the stage <lb/>
and closed the business, there will be enough of <lb/>
them accumulated in the museum on the Other <lb/>
Side to start a heaven of their own&#x2014;and jam it.</p>
<p>Each in his turn those little supernaturals of <lb/>
our by-gone ages and &#x00E6;ons joined the monster <lb/>
procession of his predecessors and marched <lb/>
horizonward, disappeared, and was forgotten. <lb/>
They changed nothing, they built nothing, they <lb/>
left nothing behind them to remember them by, <lb/>
nothing to hold their disciples together, noth- <lb/>
ing to solidify their work and enable it to defy <lb/>
the assaults of time and the weather. They <lb/>
passed, and left a vacancy. They made one <lb/>
fatal mistake; they all made it, each in his turn: <lb/>
they failed to <i>organize</i> their forces, they failed <lb/>
<pb n="153"/>
to <i>centralize</i> their strength, they failed to pro- <lb/>
vide a fresh Bible and a sure and perpetual cash <lb/>
income for business, and often they failed to <lb/>
provide a new and accepted Divine Personage <lb/>
to worship.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is not of that small fry. The ma- <lb/>
terials that go to the making of the rest of her <lb/>
portrait will prove it. She will furnish them <lb/>
herself:</p>
<p>She published her book. She copyrighted <lb/>
it. She copyrights everything. If she should <lb/>
say, "Good-morning; how do you do?" she <lb/>
would copyright it; for she is a careful person, <lb/>
and knows the value of small things.</p>
<p>She began to teach her Science, she began to <lb/>
heal, she began to gather converts to her new <lb/>
religion&#x2014;fervent, sincere, devoted, grateful <lb/>
people. A year or two later she organized her <lb/>
first Christian Science "Association," with six <lb/>
of her disciples on the roster.</p>
<p>She continued to teach and heal. She was <lb/>
charging nothing, she says, although she was <lb/>
very poor. She taught and healed gratis four <lb/>
years altogether, she says.</p>
<pb n="154"/>
<p>Then, in 1879&#x2013;81 she was become strong <lb/>
enough, and well enough established, to vent- <lb/>
ure a couple of impressively important moves. <lb/>
The first of these moves was to aggrandize the <lb/>
"Association" to a "<i>Church</i>." Brave? It is <lb/>
the right name for it, I think. The former <lb/>
name suggests nothing, invited no remark, no <lb/>
criticism, no inquiry, no hostility; the new <lb/>
name invited them all. She must have made <lb/>
this intrepid venture on her own motion. She <lb/>
could have had no important advisers at that <lb/>
early day. If we accept it as her own idea and <lb/>
her own act&#x2014;and I think we <i>must</i>&#x2014;we have <lb/>
one key to her character. And it will explain <lb/>
subsequent acts of hers that would merely stun <lb/>
us and stupefy us without it. Shall we call it <lb/>
courage? Or shall we call it recklessness? <lb/>
Courage observes; reflects; calculates; surveys <lb/>
the whole situation; counts the cost, estimates <lb/>
the odds, makes up its mind; then goes at the <lb/>
enterprise resolute to win or perish. Reck- <lb/>
lessness does not reflect, it plunges fearlessly in <lb/>
with a hurrah, and takes the risks, whatever <lb/>
they may be, regardless of expense. Reckless- <lb/>
ness often fails, Mrs. Eddy has never failed&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="155"/>
from the point of view of her followers. The <lb/>
point of view of other people is naturally not a <lb/>
matter of weighty importance to her.</p>
<p>The new Church was not born loose-jointed <lb/>
and featureless, but had a defined plan, a def- <lb/>
inite character, definite aims, and a name which <lb/>
was a challenge, and defied all comers. It <lb/>
was "a Mind-healing Church." It was "<i>with- <lb/>
out a creed</i>." Its name, "The Church of Christ, <lb/>
Scientist."</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy could not copyright her Church, <lb/>
but she chartered it, which was the same thing <lb/>
and relieved the pain. It had twenty-six char- <lb/>
ter members. Mrs. Eddy was at once installed <lb/>
as its pastor.</p>
<p>The other venture, above referred to, was <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy's Massachusetts Metaphysical Col- <lb/>
lege, in which was taught "the pathology of <lb/>
spiritual power." She could not copyright it, <lb/>
but she got it chartered. For faculty it had <lb/>
herself, her husband of the period (Dr. Eddy), <lb/>
and her adopted son, Dr. Foster-Eddy. The <lb/>
college term was "barely three weeks," she <lb/>
says. Again she was bold, brave, rash, reckless <lb/>
&#x2014;choose for yourself&#x2014;for she not only began <lb/>
<pb n="156"/>
to charge the student, but charged him <i>a hun- <lb/>
dred dollars a week</i> for the enlightenments. And <lb/>
got it? some may ask. Easily. Pupils flocked <lb/>
from far and near. They came by the hundred. <lb/>
Presently the term was cut down nearly half, <lb/>
but the price remained as before. To be exact, <lb/>
the term-cut was to seven lessons&#x2014;price, three <lb/>
hundred dollars. The college "yielded a large <lb/>
income." This is believable. In seven years <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy taught, as she avers, over four thou- <lb/>
sand students in it. (Preface to 1902 edition of <lb/>
<i>Science and Health</i>.) Three hundred times four <lb/>
thousand is&#x2014;but perhaps you can cipher it <lb/>
yourself. I could do it ordinarily, but I fell <lb/>
down yesterday and hurt my leg. Cipher it; <lb/>
you will see that it is a grand sum for a woman <lb/>
to earn in seven years. Yet that was not all <lb/>
she got out of her college in the seven.</p>
<p>At the time that she was charging the pri- <lb/>
mary student three hundred dollars for twelve <lb/>
lessons she was not content with this tidy as- <lb/>
sessment, but had other ways of plundering <lb/>
him. By advertisement she offered him priv- <lb/>
ileges whereby he could add eighteen lessons to <lb/>
his store for five hundred dollars more. That <lb/>
<pb n="157"/>
is to say, he could get a total of thirty lessons <lb/>
in her college for eight hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Four thousand times eight hundred is&#x2014;but <lb/>
it is a difficult sum for a cripple who has not <lb/>
been "demonstrated over" to cipher; let it go. <lb/>
She taught "over" four thousand students in <lb/>
seven years. "Over" is not definite, but it <lb/>
probably represents a non-paying surplus of <lb/>
learners over and above the paying four thou- <lb/>
sand. Charity students, doubtless. I think <lb/>
that as interesting an advertisement as has <lb/>
been printed since the romantic old days of the <lb/>
other buccaneers is this one from the <i>Christian <lb/>
Science Journal</i> for September, 1886:</p>
<p rend="center">"MASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL <lb/>

six daily lectures, and is open only to students <lb/>
from this college. Tuition, one hundred dollars.</p>

the Scriptures, and summary of the principle <lb/>
and practice of Christian Science, two hundred <lb/>

<p>"Normal class is open to those who have <lb/>
taken the first course at this college; six daily <lb/>
lectures complete the Normal course. Tuition, <lb/>
two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>"No invalids, and only persons of good moral <lb/>
character, are accepted as students. All stu- <lb/>
dents are subject to examination and rejection; <lb/>
and they are liable to leave the class if found <lb/>
unfit to remain in it.</p>
<p>"A limited number of clergymen received <lb/>
free of charge.</p>

<p>There it is&#x2014;the horse-leech's daughter alive <lb/>
again, after a three-century vacation. Fifty <lb/>
<pb n="159"/>
or sixty hours' lecturing for eight hundred <lb/>
dollars.</p>
<p>I was in error as to one matter: there are <lb/>
no charity students. Gratis-taught clergymen <lb/>
must not be placed under that head; they are <lb/>
merely an advertisement. Pauper students can <lb/>
get into the infant class on a two - third rate <lb/>
(cash in advance), but not even an archangel <lb/>
can get into the rest of the game at anything <lb/>
short of par, cash down. For it is "in the spirit <lb/>
of Christ's charity, as one who is joyful to bear <lb/>
healing to the sick"<ref target="n27"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n27" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Mrs. Eddy's Introduction to <i>Science and Health</i>.</p></note> that Mrs. Eddy is working <lb/>
the game. She sends the healing to them out- <lb/>

of inconsistency,<ref target="n28"><sup>2</sup></ref><note id="n28" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>2</sup></seg><p>"There is no disease"; "sickness is a belief only."&#x2014; <lb/>

Eddy would not be Mrs. Eddy if she should ever <lb/>
chance to be consistent about anything two <lb/>
days running.</p>
<p>Except in the matter of the Dollar. The <lb/>
<pb n="160"/>
Dollar, and appetite for power and notoriety. <lb/>
English must also be added; she is always con- <lb/>
sistent, she is always Mrs. Eddy, in her English: <lb/>
it is always and consistently confused and crip- <lb/>
pled and poor. She wrote the Advertisement; <lb/>
her literary trade-marks are there. When she <lb/>
says all "students" are subject to examination, <lb/>
she does not mean students, she means candi- <lb/>
dates for that lofty place. When she says stu- <lb/>
dents are "liable" to leave the class if found <lb/>
unfit to remain in it, she does not mean that if <lb/>
they find themselves unfit, or be found unfit by <lb/>
others, they will be likely to ask permission to <lb/>
leave the class; she means that if <i>she</i> finds them <lb/>
unfit she will be "liable" to fire them out. <lb/>
When she nobly offers "tuition for all strictly <lb/>
in advance," she does not mean "<i>instruction</i> <lb/>
for all in advance&#x2014;payment for it later." No, <lb/>
that is only what she says, it is not what she <lb/>
means. If she had written <i>Science and Health</i>, <lb/>
the oldest man in the world would not be able <lb/>
to tell with certainty what any passage in it <lb/>
was intended to mean.</p>

<head><b><smcap>chapter vii</smcap></b></head>
<p><smcap>Her</smcap> Church was on its legs.</p>
<p>She was its pastor. It was prospering.</p>
<p>She was appointed one of a committee to <lb/>
draught By-laws for its government. It may <lb/>
be observed, without overplus of irreverence, <lb/>
that this was larks for her. <i>She did all of the <lb/>
draughting herself</i>. From the very beginning <lb/>
she was always in the front seat when there <lb/>
was business to be done; in the front seat, with <lb/>
both eyes open, and looking sharply out for <lb/>
Number One; in the front seat, working Mortal <lb/>
Mind with fine effectiveness and giving Immor- <lb/>
tal Mind a rest for Sunday. When her Church <lb/>
was reorganized, by-and-by, the By-laws were <lb/>
retained. She saw to that. In these Laws for <lb/>
the government of her Church, her empire, her <lb/>
despotism, Mrs. Eddy's character is embalmed <lb/>
for good and all. I think a particularized ex- <lb/>
amination of these Church-laws will be found <lb/>
interesting. And not the less so if we keep in <lb/>
<pb n="162"/>
mind that they were "impelled by a power not <lb/>
one's own," as she says&#x2014;<i>Anglice</i>, the inspira- <lb/>
tion of God.</p>
<p>It is a Church "without a creed." Still, it <lb/>
has one. Mrs. Eddy draughted it&#x2014;and copy- <lb/>
righted it. In her own name. You cannot be- <lb/>
come a member of the Mother-Church (nor of <lb/>
any Christian Science Church) without signing <lb/>
it. It forms the first chapter of the By-laws, <lb/>
and is called "Tenets." "Tenets of The Mother- <lb/>
Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist." <lb/>
It has no hell in it&#x2014;it throws it overboard.</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the pastor emeritus</smcap></head>
<p>About the time of the reorganization, Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy retired from her position of pastor of her <lb/>
Church, abolished the office of pastor in all <lb/>
branch Churches, and appointed her <i>book, Sci- <lb/>
ence and Health</i>, to be <i>pastor-universal</i>. Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy did not disconnect herself from the office <lb/>
entirely, when she retired, but appointed her- <lb/>
self Pastor Emeritus. It is a misleading title, <lb/>
and belongs to the family of that phrase "with- <lb/>
out a creed." It advertises her as being a <lb/>
<pb n="163"/>
merely honorary official, with nothing to do <lb/>
and no authority. The Czar of Russia is Em- <lb/>
peror Emeritus on the same terms. Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
was Autocrat of the Church before, with limit- <lb/>
less authority, and she kept her grip on that <lb/>
limitless authority when she took that fictitious <lb/>
title.</p>
<p>It is curious and interesting to note with what <lb/>
an unerring instinct the Pastor Emeritus has <lb/>
thought out and forecast all possible encroach- <lb/>
ments upon her planned autocracy, and barred <lb/>
the way against them, in the By-laws which <lb/>
she framed and copyrighted&#x2014;under the guid- <lb/>
ance of the Supreme Being.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the board of directors</smcap></head>
<p>For instance, when Article I. speaks of a <lb/>
President and Board of Directors, you think <lb/>
you have discovered a formidable check upon <lb/>
the powers and ambitions of the honorary pas- <lb/>
tor, the ornamental pastor, the functionless pas- <lb/>
tor, the Pastor Emeritus, but it is a mistake. <lb/>
These great officials are of the phrase-family of <lb/>
the Church-Without-a-Creed and the Pastor- <lb/>
<pb n="164"/>
With-Nothing-to-Do; that is to say, of the <lb/>
family of Large-Names-Which-Mean-Nothing. <lb/>
The Board is of so little consequence that the <lb/>
By-laws do not state how it is chosen, nor who <lb/>
does it; but they do state, most definitely, that <lb/>
the Board cannot fill a vacancy in its number <lb/>
"<i>except the candidate is approved by the Pastor <lb/>
Emeritus</i>."</p>
<p>The "<i>candidate</i>." The Board cannot even <lb/>
proceed to an election until the Pastor Emeritus <lb/>
has examined the list and squelched such can- <lb/>
didates as are not satisfactory to her.</p>
<p>Whether the original first Board began as the <lb/>
personal property of Mrs. Eddy or not, it is <lb/>
foreseeable that in time, under this By-law, <lb/>
she would own it. Such a first Board might <lb/>
chafe under such a rule as that, and try to <lb/>
legislate it out of existence some day. But <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy was awake. She foresaw that dan- <lb/>
ger, and added this ingenious and effective <lb/>

the approval of the Pastor Emeritus</i>."</p>
<p>Therefore <i>She</i> elects him.</p>
<p>A long term can invest a high official with <lb/>
influence and power, and make him dangerous. <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy reflected upon that; so she limits the <lb/>
President's term to <i>a year</i>. She has a capable <lb/>
commerical head, an organizing head, a head <lb/>
for government.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>treasurer and clerk</smcap></head>
<p>There are a Treasurer and a Clerk. They are <lb/>
elected by the Board of Directors. That is to <lb/>
say, <i>by Mrs. Eddy</i>.</p>
<p>Their terms of office expire on the first Tues- <lb/>
day in June of each year, "<i>or</i> upon the election <lb/>
of their successors." They must be watchfully <lb/>
obedient and satisfactory to her, or she will <lb/>
elect and install their successors with a sud- <lb/>
denness that can be unpleasant to them. It <lb/>
<pb n="166"/>
goes without saying that the Treasurer man- <lb/>
ages the Treasury to suit Mrs. Eddy, and is in <lb/>
fact merely Temporary Deputy Treasurer.</p>
<p>Apparently the Clerk has but two duties to <lb/>
perform: to read messages from Mrs. Eddy to <lb/>
First Members assembled in solemn Council, <lb/>
and provide lists of candidates for Church <lb/>
membership. The select body entitled First <lb/>
Members are the aristocracy of the Mother- <lb/>
Church, the Charter Members, the Aborigines, <lb/>
a sort of stylish but unsalaried little College of <lb/>
Cardinals, good for show, but not indispensable. <lb/>
<i>Nobody</i> is indispensable in Mrs. Eddy's empire; <lb/>
she sees to that.</p>
<p>When the Pastor Emeritus sends a letter or <lb/>
message to that little Sanhedrin, it is the Clerk's <lb/>
"imperative duty" to read it "at the place and <lb/>
time specified." Otherwise, the world might <lb/>
come to an end. These are fine, large frills, and <lb/>
remind us of the ways of emperors and such. <lb/>
Such do not use the penny-post, they send a <lb/>
gilded and painted special messenger, and he <lb/>
strides into the Parliament, and business comes <lb/>
to a sudden and solemn and awful stop; and in <lb/>
the impressive hush that follows, the Chief <lb/>
<pb n="167"/>
Clerk reads the document. It is his "impera- <lb/>
tive duty." If he should neglect it, his official <lb/>
life would end. It is the same with this Mother- <lb/>
Church Clerk; "if he fail to perform this im- <lb/>
portant function of his office," certain majestic <lb/>
and unshirkable solemnities <i>must</i> follow: a spe- <lb/>
cial meeting "shall" be called; a member of the <lb/>
Church "shall" make formal complaint; then <lb/>
the Clerk "shall" be "removed from office." <lb/>
Complaint is sufficient, no trial is necessary.</p>
<p>There is something very sweet and juvenile <lb/>
and innocent and pretty about these little tin- <lb/>
sel vanities, these grave apings of monarchical <lb/>
fuss and feathers and ceremony, here on our <lb/>
ostentatiously democratic soil. She is the <lb/>
same lady that we found in the <i>Autobiography</i>, <lb/>
who was so na&#x00EF;vely vain of all that little ances- <lb/>
tral military riffraff that she had dug up and <lb/>
annexed. A person's nature never changes. <lb/>
What it is in childhood, it remains. Under <lb/>
pressure, or a change of interest, it can partially <lb/>
or wholly disappear from sight, and for con- <lb/>
siderable stretches of time, but nothing can <lb/>
ever permanently modify it, nothing can ever <lb/>
remove it.</p>

<p>These are a feature of <i>first</i> importance in the <lb/>
church-machinery of Christian Science. For <lb/>
they occupy the pulpit. They hold the place <lb/>
that the preacher holds in the other Christian <lb/>
Churches. They hold that place, but <i>they do <lb/>
not preach</i>. Two of them are on duty at a time <lb/>
&#x2014;a man and a woman. One reads a passage <lb/>
from the Bible, the other reads the explanation <lb/>
of it from <i>Science and Health</i>&#x2014;and so they go <lb/>
on alternating. This constitutes the service&#x2014; <lb/>
this, with choir-music. <i>They utter no word of <lb/>
their own</i>. Art. IV., Sec. 6, closes their mouths <lb/>
with this uncompromising gag:</p>
<p>"<i>They shall make no remarks explanatory of <lb/>
the Lesson-Sermon at any time during the ser- <lb/>
vice</i>."</p>
<pb n="170"/>
<p>It seems a simple little thing. One is not <lb/>
startled by it at a first reading of it; nor at the <lb/>
second, nor the third. One may have to read <lb/>
it a dozen times before the whole magnitude of <lb/>
it rises before the mind. It far and away over- <lb/>
sizes and outclasses the best business-idea yet <lb/>
invented for the safe-guarding and perpetuat- <lb/>
ing of a religion. If it had been thought of <lb/>
and put in force eighteen hundred and seventy <lb/>
years ago, there would be but one Christian <lb/>
sect in the world now, instead of ten dozens <lb/>
of them.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of men in the world, <lb/>
consequently there are many varieties of minds <lb/>
in its pulpits. This insures many differing in- <lb/>
terpretations of important Scripture texts, and <lb/>
this in turn insures the splitting up of a religion <lb/>
into many sects. It is what has happened; it <lb/>
was sure to happen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy has noted this disastrous result <lb/>
of preaching, and has put up the bars. She <lb/>
will have no preaching in her Church. <i>She</i> has <lb/>
explained all essential Scriptures, and set the <lb/>
explanations down in her book. In her belief <lb/>
her underlings cannot improve upon those ex- <lb/>
<pb n="171"/>
planations, and in that stern sentence "<i>they <lb/>
shall make no explanatory remarks</i>" she has <lb/>
barred them for all time from trying. She <lb/>
will be obeyed; there is no question about <lb/>
that.</p>
<p>In arranging her government she has bor- <lb/>
rowed ideas from various sources&#x2014;not poor <lb/>
ones, but the best in the governmental market <lb/>
&#x2014;but this one is new, this one came out of no <lb/>
ordinary business-head, this one must have <lb/>
come out of her own, there has been no other <lb/>
commercial skull in a thousand centuries that <lb/>
was equal to it. She has borrowed freely and <lb/>
wisely, but I am sure that this idea is many <lb/>
times larger than all her borrowings bulked to- <lb/>
gether. One must respect the business-brain <lb/>
that produced it&#x2014;the splendid pluck and im- <lb/>
pudence that ventured to promulgate it, any- <lb/>
way.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>election of readers</smcap></head>
<p>Readers are not taken at hap-hazard, any <lb/>
more than preachers are taken at hap-hazard <lb/>
for the pulpits of other sects. No, Readers <lb/>
are elected by the Board of Directors. <i>But</i>&#x2014;</p>
<pb n="172"/>
<p>"<i>Section</i> 3. The Board shall inform the Pas- <lb/>
tor Emeritus of the names of <i>candidates</i> for <lb/>
Readers before they are elected, and <i>if she ob- <lb/>
jects to the nomination, said candidates shall not <lb/>
be chosen</i>."</p>
<p>Is <i>that</i> an election&#x2014;by the <i>Board?</i> Thus far <lb/>
I have not been able to find out what that <lb/>
Board of Spectres is for. It certainly has no <lb/>
real function, no duty which the hired girl could <lb/>
not perform, no office beyond the mere record- <lb/>
ing of the autocrat's decrees.</p>
<p>There are no dangerously long office-terms <lb/>
in Mrs. Eddy's government. The Readers are <lb/>
elected for but one year. This insures their <lb/>
subserviency to their proprietor.</p>
<p>Readers are not allowed to copy out passages <lb/>
and read them from the <i>manuscript</i> in the pul- <lb/>
pit; they must read from <i>Mrs. Eddy's book</i> itself. <lb/>
She is right. Slight changes could be slyly <lb/>
made, repeated, and in time get acceptance <lb/>
with congregations. Branch sects could grow <lb/>
out of these practices. Mrs. Eddy knows the <lb/>
human race, and how far to trust it. Her limit <lb/>
is not over a quarter of an inch. It is all that <lb/>
a wise person will risk.</p>
<pb n="173"/>
<p>Mrs. Eddy's inborn disposition to copyright <lb/>
everything, charter everything, secure the <lb/>
rightful and proper credit to herself for every- <lb/>
thing she does, and everything she thinks she <lb/>
does, and everything she thinks, and every- <lb/>
thing she thinks she thinks or has thought or <lb/>
intends to think, is illustrated in Sec. 5 of <lb/>
Art. IV., defining the duties of official Readers <lb/>
&#x2014;in church:</p>
<p>"<i>Naming Book and Author</i>. The Reader of <lb/>
<i>Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures</i>, <lb/>
before commencing to read from this book, <lb/>
shall <i>distinctly announce its full title and give the <lb/>
author's name</i>."</p>
<p>Otherwise the congregation might get the <lb/>
habit of forgetting who (ostensibly) wrote the <lb/>
book.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the aristocracy</smcap></head>
<p>This consists of First Members and their <lb/>
apostolic succession. It is a close corporation, <lb/>
and its membership limit is one hundred. Forty <lb/>
will answer, but if the number fall below that, <lb/>
<pb n="174"/>
there must be an election, to fill the grand <lb/>
quorum.</p>
<p>This Sanhedrin can't <i>do</i> anything of the <lb/>
slightest importance, but it can <i>talk</i>. It can <lb/>
"discuss." That is, it can discuss "impor- <lb/>
tant questions relative to Church members", <lb/>
evidently persons who are already Church <lb/>
members. This affords it amusement, and <lb/>
does no harm.</p>
<p>It can "fix the salaries of the Readers."</p>
<p>Twice a year it "votes on" admitting candi- <lb/>
dates. That is, for Church membership. But <lb/>
its work is cut out for it beforehand, by Sec. <lb/>
2, Art. IX.:</p>
<p>"Every recommendation for membership in <lb/>
the Church 'shall be countersigned by a loyal <lb/>
student of Mrs. Eddy's, by a Director of this <lb/>
Church, or by a First Member.'"</p>
<p>All these three classes of beings are the per- <lb/>
sonal property of Mrs. Eddy. She has abso- <lb/>
lute control of the elections.</p>
<p>Also it must "transact any Church business <lb/>
that may properly come before it."</p>
<p>"Properly" is a thoughtful word. <i>No</i> im- <lb/>
<pb n="175"/>
portant business can come before it. The By- <lb/>
laws have attended to that. No important <lb/>
business goes before <i>any</i> one for the final word <lb/>
except Mrs. Eddy. She has looked to that.</p>
<p>The Sanhedrin "votes on" candidates for ad- <lb/>
mission to its own body. But is its vote worth <lb/>
any more than mine would be? No, it isn't. <lb/>
Sec. 4, of Art. V.&#x2014;Election of First Members <lb/>
&#x2014;makes this quite plain:</p>
<p>"Before being elected, the candidates for <lb/>
First Members <i>shall be approved by the Pastor <lb/>
Emeritus over her own signature</i>."</p>
<p>Thus the Sanhedrin is the personal property <lb/>
of Mrs. Eddy. She owns it. It has no func- <lb/>
tions, no authority, no real existence. It is <lb/>
another Board of Shadows. Mrs. Eddy is the <lb/>
Sanhedrin herself.</p>
<p>But it is time to foot up again and "see where <lb/>
we are at." Thus far, Mrs. Eddy is</p>

<p>In this Article there is another exhibition of <lb/>
a couple of the large features of Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
remarkable make-up: her business-talent and <lb/>
her knowledge of human nature.</p>
<p>She does not beseech and implore people to <lb/>
join her Church. She knows the human race <lb/>
better than that. She gravely goes through <lb/>
the motions of reluctantly granting admission <lb/>
to the applicant as a favor to him. The idea <lb/>
is worth untold shekels. She does not stand <lb/>
at the gate of the fold with welcoming arms <lb/>
spread, and receive the lost sheep with glad <lb/>
emotion and set up the fatted calf and invite <lb/>
the neighbor and have a time. No, she looks <lb/>
upon him coldly, she snubs him, she says:
<pb n="177"/>
"Who are you? Who is your sponsor? Who <lb/>
asked you to come here? Go away, and don't <lb/>
come again until you are invited."</p>
<p>It is calculated to strikingly impress a per- <lb/>
son accustomed to Moody and Sankey and Sam <lb/>
Jones revivals; accustomed to brain-turning <lb/>
appeals to the unknown and unendorsed sinner <lb/>
to come forward and enter into the joy, etc.&#x2014; <lb/>
"just as he is"; accustomed to seeing him do <lb/>
it; accustomed to seeing him pass up the aisle <lb/>
through sobbing seas of welcome, and love, and <lb/>
congratulation, and arrive at the mourner's <lb/>
bench and be received like a long-lost govern- <lb/>
ment bond.</p>
<p>No, there is nothing of that kind in Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy's system. She knows that if you wish to <lb/>
confer upon a human being something which <lb/>
he is not sure he wants, the best way is to make <lb/>
it apparently difficult for him to get it&#x2014;then <lb/>
he is no son of Adam if that apple does not as- <lb/>
sume an interest in his eyes which it lacked be- <lb/>
fore. In time this interest can grow into de- <lb/>
sire. Mrs. Eddy knows that when you cannot <lb/>
get a man to try&#x2014;free of cost&#x2014;a new and effec- <lb/>
tive remedy for a disease he is afflicted with, <lb/>
<pb n="178"/>
you can generally sell it to him if you will put a <lb/>
price upon it which he cannot afford.<ref target="n29"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n29" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>I offered to cure of his passion&#x2014;gratis&#x2014;a victim of the <lb/>

difficult intellectual method which I had successfully tried <lb/>

I think my proposition couldn't rouse him, couldn't <lb/>
strongly appeal to him, could not electrify him, because it <lb/>
offered a thing so easy to get, and which could be had for <lb/>
nothing. Within a month afterwards a famous Drink- <lb/>

One values a thing when one can't afford it.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> When, <lb/>
in the beginning, she taught Christian Science <lb/>
gratis (for good reasons), pupils were few and <lb/>
reluctant, and required persuasion; it was when <lb/>
she raised the limit to three hundred dollars for <lb/>
a dollar's worth that she could not find standing <lb/>
room for the invasion of pupils that followed.</p>
<p>With fine astuteness she goes through the <lb/>
motions of making it difficult to get member- <lb/>
ship in her Church. There is a twofold value <lb/>
in this system: it gives membership a high value <lb/>
in the eyes of the applicant; and at the same <lb/>
time the requirements exacted enable Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy to keep him out if she has doubts about <lb/>
<pb n="179"/>
his value to her. A word further as to appli- <lb/>
cations for membership:</p>
<p>"Applications of students of the Metaphys- <lb/>
ical College must be signed by the <i>Board of <lb/>
Directors</i>."</p>
<p>That is safe. Mrs. Eddy is proprietor of that <lb/>
Board.</p>
<p>Children of twelve may be admitted if in- <lb/>
vited by "one of Mrs. Eddy's loyal students, <lb/>
or by a First Member, or by a Director."</p>
<p>These sponsors are the property of Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy, therefore her Church is safeguarded <lb/>
from the intrusion of undesirable children.</p>
<p>Other Students. Applicants who have not <lb/>
studied with Mrs. Eddy can get in only "by <lb/>
invitation and recommendation from students <lb/>
of Mrs. Eddy &#x2026; or from members of the <lb/>
Mother-Church."</p>
<p>Other paragraphs explain how two or three <lb/>
other varieties of applicants are to be chal- <lb/>
lenged and obstructed, and tell us who is au- <lb/>
thorized to invite them, recommend them, <lb/>
endorse them, and all that.</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>The safeguards are definite, and would seem <lb/>
to be sufficiently strenuous&#x2014;to Mr. Sam Jones, <lb/>
at any rate. Not for Mrs. Eddy. She adds <lb/>
this clincher:</p>
<p><i>"The candidates shall be elected by a majority <lb/>
vote of the First Members present."</i></p>
<p>That is the aristocracy, the aborigines, the <lb/>
Sanhedrin. It is Mrs. Eddy's property. She <lb/>
<i>herself</i> is the Sanhedrin. No one can get <lb/>
into the Church if she wishes to keep him <lb/>
out.</p>
<p>This veto power could some time or other <lb/>
have a large value for her, therefore she was <lb/>
wise to reserve it.</p>
<p>It is likely that it is not frequently used. It <lb/>
is also probable that the difficulties attendant <lb/>
upon getting admission to membership have <lb/>
been instituted more to invite than to deter, <lb/>
more to enhance the value of membership and <lb/>
make people long for it than to make it really <lb/>
difficult to get. I think so, because the Mother- <lb/>
Church has many thousands of members more <lb/>
than its building can accommodate.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<pb n="181"/>
<head><smcap>andsome english required</smcap></head>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is very particular as regards one <lb/>
detail&#x2014;curiously so, for her, all things con- <lb/>
sidered. The Church Readers must be "good <lb/>
English scholars"; they must be "thorough <lb/>
English scholars."</p>
<p>She is thus sensitive about the English of her <lb/>
subordinates for cause, possibly. In her chap- <lb/>
ter defining the duties of the Clerk there is an <lb/>
indication that she harbors resentful memories <lb/>
of an occasion when the hazy quality of her <lb/>
own English made unforeseen and mortifying <lb/>
trouble:</p>
<p>"<i>Understanding Communications. Sec. 2</i>. If <lb/>
the Clerk of this Church shall receive a com- <lb/>
munication from the Pastor Emeritus which he <lb/>
does not fully understand, he shall inform her <lb/>
of this fact before presenting it to the Church, <lb/>
and obtain a clear understanding of the matter <lb/>
&#x2014;then act in accordance therewith."</p>
<p>She should have waited to calm down, then, <lb/>
but instead she added this, which lacks sugar:</p>
<pb n="182"/>
<p>"Failing to adhere to this By-law, the Clerk <lb/>
must <i>resign</i>."</p>
<p>I wish I could see that communication that <lb/>
broke the camel's back. It was probably the <lb/>
one beginning: "What plague spot or bacilli <lb/>
were gnawing at the heart of this metropolis <lb/>
and bringing it on bended knee?" and I think <lb/>
it likely that the kindly disposed Clerk tried <lb/>
to translate it into English and lost his mind <lb/>
and had to go to the hospital. That By- <lb/>
law was not the offspring of a forecast, an <lb/>
intuition, it was certainly born of a sorrow- <lb/>
ful experience. Its temper gives the fact <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>The little book of By-laws has manifestly <lb/>
been tinkered by one of Mrs. Eddy's "thorough <lb/>
English scholars," for in the majority of cases <lb/>
its meanings are clear. The book is not even <lb/>
marred by Mrs. Eddy's peculiar specialty&#x2014; <lb/>
lumbering clumsinesses of speech. I believe <lb/>
the salaried polisher has weeded them all <lb/>
out but one. In one place, after referring <lb/>
to <i>Science and Health</i>, Mrs. Eddy goes on <lb/>
to say "the Bible and the above - named <lb/>
<pb n="183"/>
book, with other works by the same author," <lb/>
etc.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate sentence, for it could <lb/>
mislead a hasty or careless reader for a mo- <lb/>
ment. Mrs. Eddy framed it&#x2014;it is her very <lb/>
own&#x2014;it bears her trade-mark. "The Bible <lb/>
and <i>Science and Health</i>, with other works by the <lb/>
same author," could have come from no liter- <lb/>
ary vacuum but the one which produced the <lb/>
remark (in the <i>Autobiography</i>): "I remember <lb/>
reading, in my childhood, certain manuscripts <lb/>
containing Scriptural Sonnets, besides other <lb/>
verses and enigmas."</p>
<p>We know what she means, in both instances, <lb/>
but a low-priced Clerk would not necessarily <lb/>
know, and on a salary like his he could quite <lb/>
excusably aver that the Pastor Emeritus had <lb/>
commanded him to come and make proclama- <lb/>
tion that she was author of the Bible, and that <lb/>
she was thinking of discharging some Scriptural <lb/>
sonnets and other enigmas upon the congrega- <lb/>
tion. It could lose him his place, but it would <lb/>
not be fair, if it happened before the edict about <lb/>
"Understanding Communications" was pro- <lb/>
mulgated.</p>

<head><smcap>"readers" again</smcap></head>
<p>The By-law book makes a showy pretence <lb/>
of orderliness and system, but it is only a pre- <lb/>
tence. I will not go so far as to say it is a <lb/>
harum-scarum jumble, for it is not that, but I <lb/>
think it fair to say it is at least jumbulacious in <lb/>
places. For instance, Articles III. and IV. set <lb/>
forth in much detail the qualifications and duties <lb/>
of Readers, she then skips some thirty pages and <lb/>
takes up the subject again. It looks like slov- <lb/>
enliness, but it may be only art. The belated <lb/>
By-law has a sufficiently quiet look, but it has <lb/>
a ton of dynamite in it. <i>It makes all the Chris- <lb/>
tian Science Church Readers on the globe the <lb/>
personal chattels of Mrs. Eddy</i>. Whenever she <lb/>
chooses, she can stretch her long arm around <lb/>
the world's fat belly and flirt a Reader out of <lb/>
his pulpit, though he be tucked away in seeming <lb/>
safety and obscurity in a lost village in the mid- <lb/>
dle of China:</p>
<p>"<i>In any Church. Sec. 2</i>. The Pastor Emer- <lb/>
itus of the Mother-Church shall have the right <lb/>
(through a <i>letter</i> addressed to the individual <lb/>
<pb n="185"/>
and Church of which he is the Reader) to re- <lb/>
move a Reader from this office in any Church <lb/>
of Christ, Scientist, both in America and in for- <lb/>
eign nations; or to appoint the Reader to fill <lb/>
any office belonging to the Christian Science <lb/>
denomination."</p>
<p>She does not have to prefer charges against <lb/>
him, she does not have to find him lazy, care- <lb/>
less, incompetent, untidy, ill-mannered, unholy, <lb/>
dishonest, she does not have to discover a fault <lb/>
of any kind in him, she does not have to tell <lb/>
him nor his congregation why she dismisses and <lb/>
disgraces him and insults his meek flock, she <lb/>
does not have to explain to his family why she <lb/>
takes the bread out of their mouths and turns <lb/>
them out-of-doors homeless and ashamed in a <lb/>
strange land; she does not have to do anything <lb/>
but send a <i>letter</i> and say: "Pack!&#x2014;and ask no <lb/>
questions!"</p>
<p>Has the Pope this power?&#x2014;the other Pope&#x2014; <lb/>
the one in Rome. Has he anything approach- <lb/>
ing it? Can he turn a priest out of his pulpit <lb/>
and strip him of his office and his livelihood <lb/>
just upon a whim, a caprice, and meanwhile <lb/>
furnishing no reasons to the parish? Not in <lb/>
<pb n="186"/>
America. And not elsewhere, we may be- <lb/>
lieve.</p>
<p>It is odd and strange, to see intelligent and <lb/>
educated people among us worshipping this self- <lb/>
seeking and remorseless tyrant as a God. This <lb/>
worship is denied&#x2014;by persons who are them- <lb/>
selves worshippers of Mrs. Eddy. I feel quite <lb/>
sure that it is a worship which will continue <lb/>
during ages.</p>
<p>That Mrs. Eddy wrote that amazing By-law <lb/>
with her own hand we have much better evi- <lb/>
dence than her word. We have her English. <lb/>
It is there. It cannot be imitated. She ought <lb/>
never to go to the expense of copyrighting her <lb/>
verbal discharges. When any one tries to <lb/>
claim them she should call me; I can always <lb/>
tell them from any other literary apprentice's <lb/>
at a glance. It was like her to call America a <lb/>
"nation"; she would call a sand-bar a nation if <lb/>
it should fall into a sentence in which she was <lb/>
speaking of peoples, for she would not know <lb/>
how to untangle it and get it out and classify it <lb/>
by itself. And the closing arrangement of that <lb/>
By-law is in true Eddysonian form, too. In <lb/>
it she reserves authority to make a Reader fill <lb/>
<pb n="187"/>
any office connected with a Science church&#x2014; <lb/>
sexton, grave-digger, advertising-agent, Annex- <lb/>
polisher, leader of the choir, President, Direc- <lb/>
tor, Treasurer, Clerk, etc. She did not mean <lb/>
that. She already possessed that authority. <lb/>
She meant to clothe herself with power, despotic <lb/>
and unchallengeable, to appoint all Science <lb/>
Readers to their offices, both at home and <lb/>
abroad. The phrase "or to appoint" is another <lb/>
miscarriage of intention; she did not mean <lb/>
"or," she meant "and."</p>
<p>That By-law puts into Mrs. Eddy's hands <i>ab- <lb/>
solute command</i> over the most formidable force <lb/>
and influence existent in the Christian Science <lb/>
kingdom outside of herself, and it does this <i>un- <lb/>
conditionally</i> and (by auxiliary force of Laws <lb/>
already quoted) <i>irrevocably</i>. Still, she is not <lb/>
quite satisfied. Something might happen, she <lb/>
doesn't know what. Therefore she drives in <lb/>
one more nail, to make sure, and drives it <lb/>
deep:</p>
<p>"<i>This By-law can neither be amended nor <lb/>
annulled, except by consent of the Pastor Emer- <lb/>
itus</i>."</p>
<pb n="188"/>
<p>Let some one with a wild and delirious fancy <lb/>
try and see if he can imagine her furnishing <lb/>
that consent.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>monopoly of spiritual bread</smcap></head>
<p>Very properly, the first qualification for mem- <lb/>
bership in the Mother-Church is belief in the <lb/>
doctrines of Christian Science.</p>
<p>But these doctrines must not be gathered <lb/>
from secondary sources. There is but <i>one</i> <lb/>
recognized source. The candidate must be a <lb/>
believer in the doctrines of Christian Science <lb/>
<i>"according to the platform and teaching con- <lb/>
tained in the Christian Science text-book, 'Science <lb/>
and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,' by Rev. <lb/>
Mary Baker G. Eddy."</i></p>
<p>That is definite, and is final. There are to <lb/>
be no commentaries, no labored volumes of <lb/>
exposition and explanation by anybody except <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy. Because such things could sow <lb/>
error, create warring opinions, split the religion <lb/>
into sects, and disastrously cripple its power. <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy will do the <i>whole</i> of the explaining, <lb/>
herself&#x2014;has done it, in fact. She has written <lb/>
<pb n="189"/>
several books. They are to be had (for cash <lb/>
in advance); they are all sacred; additions to <lb/>
them can never be needed and will never be <lb/>
permitted. They tell the candidate how to in- <lb/>
struct himself, how to teach others, how to do <lb/>
all things comprised in the business&#x2014;and they <lb/>
close the door against all would-be competitors, <lb/>
and monopolize the trade:</p>
<p>"The Bible and the above - named book <lb/>
[<i>Science and Health</i>], with other works by the <lb/>
same author," must be his <i>only</i> text-books for <lb/>
the commerce&#x2014; he cannot forage outside.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy's words are to be the <i>sole</i> elucida- <lb/>
tors of the Bible and <i>Science and Health</i>&#x2014;for- <lb/>
ever. Throughout the ages, whenever there is <lb/>
doubt as to the meaning of a passage in either <lb/>
of these books the inquirer will not dream of <lb/>
trying to explain it to himself; he would shud- <lb/>
der at the thought of such temerity, such pro- <lb/>
fanity; he would be haled to the Inquisition <lb/>
and thence to the public square and the stake <lb/>
if he should be caught studying into text-mean- <lb/>
ings on his own hook; he will be prudent and <lb/>
seek the meanings at the only permitted source, <lb/>
<i>Mrs. Eddy's commentaries</i>.</p>
<pb n="190"/>
<p><i>Value of this Strait-jacket</i>. One must not un- <lb/>
derrate the magnificence of this long - headed <lb/>
idea, one must not underestimate its giant pos- <lb/>
sibilities in the matter of hooping the Church <lb/>
solidly together and keeping it so. It squelches <lb/>
independent inquiry, and makes such a thing <lb/>
impossible, profane, criminal, it authoritatively <lb/>
settles every dispute that can arise. It <i>starts</i> <lb/>
with <i>finality</i>&#x2014;a point which the Roman Church <lb/>
has travelled towards fifteen or sixteen cen- <lb/>
turies, stage by stage, and has not yet reached. <lb/>
The matter of the Immaculate Conception of <lb/>
the Virgin Mary was not authoritatively set- <lb/>
tled until the days of Pius IX.&#x2014;yesterday, so <lb/>
to speak.</p>
<p>As already noticed, the Protestants are bro- <lb/>
ken up into a long array of sects, a result of <lb/>
disputes about the meanings of texts, disputes <lb/>
made unavoidable by the absence of an infalli- <lb/>
ble authority to submit doubtful passages to. <lb/>
A week or two ago (I am writing in the middle <lb/>
of January, 1903), the clergy and others here- <lb/>
abouts had a warm dispute in the papers over <lb/>
this question: Did Jesus anywhere claim to <lb/>
be God? It seemed an easy question, but it <lb/>
<pb n="191"/>
turned out to be a hard one. It was ably and <lb/>
elaborately discussed, by learned men of several <lb/>
denominations, but in the end it remained un- <lb/>
settled.</p>
<p>A week ago, another discussion broke out. <lb/>
It was over this text:</p>
<p>"Sell all that thou hast and distribute unto <lb/>
the poor."</p>
<p>One verdict was worded as follows:</p>
<p>"When Christ answered the rich young man <lb/>
and said for him to give to the poor all he <lb/>
possessed or he could not gain everlasting <lb/>
life, He did not mean it in the literal sense. <lb/>
My interpretation of His words is that we <lb/>
should part with what comes between us and <lb/>
Christ.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that Jesus believed that <lb/>
the rich young man thought more of his wealth <lb/>
than he did of his soul, and, such being the case, <lb/>
it was his duty to give up the wealth.</p>
<p>"Every one of us knows that there is some- <lb/>
thing we should give up for Christ. Those who <lb/>
are true believers and followers know what they <lb/>
have given up, and those who are not yet fol- <lb/>
<pb n="192"/>
lowers know down in their hearts what they <lb/>
must give up."</p>
<p>Ten clergymen of various denominations were <lb/>
interviewed, and nine of them agreed with that <lb/>
verdict. That did not settle the matter, be- <lb/>
cause the tenth said the language of Jesus was <lb/>
so strait and definite that it explained <i>itself:</i> <lb/>
"Sell <i>all</i>," not a percentage.</p>
<p>There is a most unusual feature about that <lb/>
dispute: the nine persons who decided alike, <lb/>
quoted not a single authority in support of their <lb/>
position. I do not know when I have seen <lb/>
trained disputants do the like of that before. <lb/>
The nine merely furnished their own opinions, <lb/>
founded upon&#x2014;nothing at all. In the other <lb/>
dispute ("Did Jesus anywhere claim to be <lb/>
God?") the same kind of men&#x2014;trained and <lb/>
learned clergymen&#x2014;backed up their argu- <lb/>
ments with chapter and verse. On both sides. <lb/>
Plenty of verses. Were no reinforcing verses <lb/>
to be found in the present case? It looks that <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>The opinion of the nine seems strange to me, <lb/>
for it is unsupported by authority, while there <lb/>
<pb n="193"/>
was at least constructive authority for the op- <lb/>
posite view.</p>
<p>It is hair-splitting differences of opinion over <lb/>
disputed text-meanings that have divided into <lb/>
many sects a once united Church. One may <lb/>
infer from some of the names in the following <lb/>
list that some of the differences are very slight <lb/>
&#x2014;so slight as to be not distinctly important, <lb/>
perhaps&#x2014;yet they have moved groups to with- <lb/>
draw from communions to which they belonged <lb/>
and set up a sect of their own. The list&#x2014;ac- <lb/>
companied by various Church statistics for <lb/>
1902, compiled by Rev. Dr. H. K. Carroll&#x2014;was <lb/>

<p>In the present month (February), Mr. E. I. <lb/>
Lindh, A.M., has communicated to the Boston <lb/>
<i>Transcript</i> a hopeful article on the solution of <lb/>
the problem of the "divided church." Divided <lb/>
<pb n="195"/>
is not too violent a term. Subdivided could <lb/>
have been permitted if he had thought of it. <lb/>
He came near thinking of it, for he mentions <lb/>
some of the subdivisions himself: "the 12 kinds <lb/>
of Presbyterians, the 17 kinds of Methodists, <lb/>
the 13 kinds of Baptists, etc." He overlooked <lb/>
the 12 kinds of Mennonites and the 22 kinds <lb/>
of Lutherans, but they are in Rev. Mr. Car- <lb/>
roll's list. Altogether, 76 splits under 5 flags. <lb/>
<i>The Literary Digest</i> (February 14th) is pleased <lb/>
with Mr. Lindh's optimistic article, and also <lb/>
with the signs of the times, and perceives that <lb/>
"the idea of Church unity is in the air."</p>
<p>Now, then, is not Mrs. Eddy profoundly wise <lb/>
in forbidding, for all time, all explanations of <lb/>
her religion except such as she shall let on to <lb/>
be her own?</p>
<p>I think so. I think there can be no doubt of <lb/>
it. In a way, they will be her own; for, no <lb/>
matter which member of her clerical staff shall <lb/>
furnish the explanations, not a line of them <lb/>
will she ever allow to be printed until she shall <lb/>
have approved it, accepted it, copyrighted it, <lb/>
cabbaged it. We may depend on that with a <lb/>
four-ace confidence.</p>

<head><smcap>the new infallibility</smcap></head>
<p>All in proper time Mrs. Eddy's factory will <lb/>
take hold of that Commandment, and explain <lb/>
it for good and all. It may be that one mem- <lb/>
ber of the shift will vote that the word "all" <lb/>
means <i>all;</i> it may be that ten members of the <lb/>
shift will vote that "all" means only a per- <lb/>
centage; but it is <i>Mrs. Eddy</i>, not the eleven, <lb/>
who will do the <i>deciding</i>. And if she says it is <lb/>
percentage, then percentage it is, forevermore <lb/>
&#x2014;and that is what I am expecting, for she <lb/>
doesn't sell all herself, nor any considerable part <lb/>
of it, and as regards the poor, she doesn't de- <lb/>
clare any dividend; but if she says "all" means <lb/>
all, then all it is, to the end of time, and no fol- <lb/>
lower of hers will ever be allowed to reconstruct <lb/>
that text, or shrink it, or inflate it, or meddle <lb/>
with it in any way at all. Even to-day&#x2014;right <lb/>
here in the beginning&#x2014;she is the sole person <lb/>
who, in the matter of Christian Science ex- <lb/>
egesis, is privileged to exploit the Spiral Twist.<ref target="n30"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n30" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>That is a technicality&#x2014;that phrase. I got it of an <lb/>

others, and still others will follow him, and be <lb/>

trine as long as they may come up, all down the <lb/>

Infallible that will ever occupy the Science <lb/>
throne. Many a Science Pope will succeed her, <lb/>
but she has closed their mouths; they will re- <lb/>
peat and reverently praise and adore her in- <lb/>
fallibilities, but venture none themselves. In <lb/>
her grave she will still outrank all other Popes, <lb/>
be they of what Church they may. She will <lb/>
hold the supremest of earthly titles, The In- <lb/>
fallible&#x2014;with a capital T. Many in the world's <lb/>
history have had a hunger for such nuggets <lb/>
and slices of power as they might reasonably <lb/>
hope to grab out of an empire's or a religion's <lb/>
assets, but Mrs. Eddy is the only person alive <lb/>
<pb n="198"/>
or dead who has ever struck for the <i>whole</i> of <lb/>
them. For small things she has the eye of a <lb/>
microscope, for large ones the eye of a telescope, <lb/>
and whatever she sees, she wants. Wants it <lb/>
all.</p>

<head><smcap>the sacred poems</smcap></head>
<p>When Mrs. Eddy's "sacred revelations" <lb/>
(that is the language of the By-laws) are read <lb/>
in public, their authorship must be named. <lb/>
The By-laws twice command this, therefore <lb/>
we mention it twice, to be fair.</p>
<p>But it is also commanded that when a mem- <lb/>
ber publicly quotes "from the poems of our <lb/>
Pastor Emeritus" the authorship shall be <lb/>
named. For these are sacred, too. There are <lb/>
kindly people who may suspect a hidden gen- <lb/>
erosity in that By-law; they may think it is <lb/>
there to protect the Official Reader from the <lb/>
suspicion of having written the poems himself. <lb/>
Such do not know Mrs. Eddy. She does an in- <lb/>
ordinate deal of protecting, but in no distinctly <lb/>
named and specified case in her history has <lb/>
Number Two been the object of it. Instances <lb/>
<pb n="199"/>
have been claimed, but they have failed of <lb/>
proof, and even of plausibility.</p>
<p>"Members shall also instruct their students" <lb/>
to look out and advertise the authorship when <lb/>
they read those poems and things. Not on <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy's account, but "for the good of our <lb/>
Cause."</p>

of much value at the time, but it is very valu- <lb/>
able now.</item>

fice on it, at a cost of two hundred and fifty <lb/>

rectors shall determine that it is inexpedient <lb/>
to maintain preaching, reading, or speaking in <lb/>

<pb n="200"/>
this deed, they are authorized and <i>required</i> to re- <lb/>
convey <i>forthwith</i> said lot of land with the build- <lb/>
ing thereon to Mary Baker G. Eddy, her heirs and <lb/>
assigns forever, by a proper deed of conveyance."</item>
</list>
<p>She is never careless, never slipshod, about <lb/>
a matter of business. Owning the property <lb/>
through her Board of Waxworks was safe <lb/>
enough, still it was sound business to set an- <lb/>
other grip on it to cover accidents, and she did it.</p>
<p>Her barkers (what a curious name; I wonder <lb/>
if it is copyrighted); her barkers persistently <lb/>
advertise to the public her generosity in giving <lb/>
away a piece of land which cost her a trifle, and <lb/>
a two - hundred - and - fifty - thousand - dollar <lb/>
church which cost her nothing; and they can <lb/>
hardly speak of the unselfishness of it without <lb/>
breaking down and crying; yet they know she <lb/>
gave nothing away, and never intended to. <lb/>
However, such is the human race. Often it <lb/>
does seem such a pity that Noah and his party <lb/>
did not miss the boat.</p>
<p>Some of the hostiles think that Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
idea in protecting this property in the interest <lb/>
of her heirs, and in accumulating a great money- <lb/>
<pb n="201"/>
fortune, is, that she may leave her natural heirs <lb/>
well provided for when she goes. I think it is a <lb/>
mistake. I think she is of late years giving her- <lb/>
self large concern about only one interest&#x2014;her <lb/>
power and glory, and the perpetuation and wor- <lb/>
ship of her Name&#x2014;with a capital N. Her <lb/>
Church is her pet heir, and I think it will get her <lb/>
wealth. It is the torch which is to light the <lb/>
world and the ages with her glory.</p>
<p>I think she once prized money for the ease <lb/>
and comfort it could bring, the showy vanities <lb/>
it could furnish, and the social promotion it <lb/>
could command; for we have seen that she was <lb/>
born into the world with little ways and in- <lb/>
stincts and aspirations and affectations that are <lb/>
duplicates of our own. I do not think her <lb/>
money-passion has ever diminished in ferocity, <lb/>
I do not think that she has ever allowed a dollar <lb/>
that had no friends to get by her alive, but I <lb/>
think her reason for wanting it has changed. I <lb/>
think she wants it now to increase and estab- <lb/>
lish and perpetuate her power and glory with, <lb/>
not to add to her comforts and luxuries, not to <lb/>
furnish paint and fuss and feathers for vain dis- <lb/>
play. I think her ambitions have soared away <lb/>
<pb n="202"/>
above the fuss - and - feather stage. She still <lb/>
likes the little shows and vanities&#x2014;a fact which <lb/>
she exposed in a public utterance two or three <lb/>
days ago when she was not noticing<ref target="n32"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n32" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>This is a reference to her public note of January 17th. <lb/>
See Appendix.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note>&#x2014;but I <lb/>
think she does not place a large value upon <lb/>
them now. She could build a mighty and far- <lb/>
shining brass-mounted palace if she wanted to, <lb/>
but she does not do it. She would have had <lb/>
that kind of an ambition in the early scrabbling <lb/>
times. She could go to England to-day and be <lb/>
worshipped by earls, and get a comet's atten- <lb/>
tion from the million, if she cared for such <lb/>
things. She would have gone in the early <lb/>
scrabbling days for much less than an earl, and <lb/>
been vain of it, and glad to show off before the <lb/>
remains of the Scotch kin. But those things <lb/>
are very small to her now&#x2014;next to invisible, <lb/>
observed through the cloud-rack from the dizzy <lb/>
summit where she perches in these great days. <lb/>
She does not want that church property for her- <lb/>
self. It is worth but a quarter of a million&#x2014;a <lb/>
sum she could call in from her far-spread flocks <lb/>
to-morrow with a lift of her hand. Not a <lb/>
<pb n="203"/>
squeeze of it, just a lift. It would come with- <lb/>
out a murmur; come gratefully, come gladly. <lb/>
And if her glory stood in more need of the money <lb/>
in Boston than it does where her flocks are <lb/>
propagating it, she would lift the hand, I think.</p>
<p>She is still reaching for the Dollar, she will <lb/>
continue to reach for it; but not that she may <lb/>
spend it upon herself; not that she may spend <lb/>
it upon charities; not that she may indemnify <lb/>
an early deprivation and clothe herself in a <lb/>
blaze of North Adams gauds; not that she may <lb/>
have nine breeds of pie for breakfast, as only <lb/>
the rich New-Englander can; not that she may <lb/>
indulge any petty material vanity or appetite <lb/>
that once was hers and prized and nursed, but <lb/>
that she may apply that Dollar to statelier <lb/>
uses, and place it where it may cast the metallic <lb/>
sheen of her glory farthest across the receding <lb/>
expanses of the globe.</p>

I do not find it in the edition of 1884. It is <lb/>

rendering of its "spiritual sense" is as fol- <lb/>
lows:</p>

Thou art ever-present. Enable us to know&#x2014; <lb/>
as in heaven, so on earth&#x2014;God is supreme. <lb/>

delivereth from sin, disease, and death.<add place="top" hand="UK"><unclear reason="handwritten">How can one be led into non existant things?</unclear></add> For <lb/>

<p>If I thought my opinion was desired and <lb/>
would be properly revered, I should say that in <lb/>
my judgment that is as good a piece of carpen- <lb/>
tering as any of those eleven Commandment- <lb/>
<pb n="205"/>
experts could do with the material, after all <lb/>
their practice. I notice only one doubtful <lb/>
place. "Lead us not into temptation" seems <lb/>
to me to be a very definite request, and that the <lb/>
new rendering turns the definite request into a <lb/>
definite assertion. I shall be glad to have that <lb/>
turned back to the old way and the marks of <lb/>
the Spiral Twist removed, or varnished over; <lb/>
then I shall be satisfied, and will do the best I <lb/>
can with what is left. At the same time, I do <lb/>
feel that the shrinkage in our spiritual assets is <lb/>
getting serious. First the Commandments, now <lb/>
the Prayer. I never expected to see these <lb/>
steady old reliable securities watered down to <lb/>
this. And this is not the whole of it. Last <lb/>
summer the Presbyterians extended the Calling <lb/>
and Election suffrage to nearly everybody en- <lb/>
titled to salvation. They did not even stop <lb/>
there, but let out all the unbaptized American <lb/>
infants we had been accumulating for two hun- <lb/>
dred years and more. There are some that be- <lb/>
lieve they would have let the Scotch ones out, <lb/>
too, if they could have done it. Everything is <lb/>
going to ruin; in no long time we shall have <lb/>
nothing left but the love of God.</p>

<head><smcap>the new unpardonable sin</smcap></head>
<p>"<i>Working Against the Cause. Sec. 2</i>. If a <lb/>
member of this Church shall work against <lb/>
the accomplishment <i>of what the Discoverer and <lb/>
Founder of Christian Science understands is ad- <lb/>
vantageous</i> to the individual, to this Church, <lb/>
and to the Cause of Christian Science"&#x2014;out he <lb/>
goes. <i>Forever</i>.</p>
<p>The member may <i>think</i> that what he is doing <lb/>
will advance the Cause, but he is not invited to <lb/>
do any thinking. More than that, he is not <lb/>
<i>permitted</i> to do any&#x2014;as he will clearly gather <lb/>
from this By-law. When a person joins Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy's Church he must leave his thinker at <lb/>
home. Leave it permanently. To make sure <lb/>
that it will not go off some time or other when <lb/>
he is not watching, it will be safest for him to <lb/>
spike it. If he should forget himself and think <lb/>
just <i>once</i>, the By-law provides that he shall be <lb/>
fired out&#x2014;instantly&#x2014;forever&#x2014;no return.</p>
<p>"It shall be the duty of this Church immedi- <lb/>
ately to call a meeting, and <i>drop forever the <lb/>
name of this member from its records</i>."</p>
<pb n="207"/>
<p>My, but it breathes a towering indignation!</p>
<p>There are forgivable offences, but this is not <lb/>
one of them; there are admonitions, probations, <lb/>
suspensions, in several minor cases; mercy is <lb/>
shown the derelict, in those cases he is gently <lb/>
used, and in time he can get back into the fold <lb/>
&#x2014;even when he has repeated his offence. But <lb/>
let him <i>think</i>, just <i>once</i>, without getting his <lb/>
thinker set to Eddy time, and that is enough; <lb/>
his head comes off. There is no second offence, <lb/>
and there is no gate open to that lost sheep, <lb/>
ever again.</p>
<p><i>"This rule cannot be changed, amended, or an- <lb/>
nulled, except by unanimous vote of all the First <lb/>
Members."</i></p>
<p>The same being <i>Mrs. Eddy</i>. It is na&#x00EF;vely sly <lb/>
and pretty to see her keep putting forward <lb/>
First Members, and Boards of This and That, <lb/>
and other broideries and ruffles of her raiment, <lb/>
as if they were independent entities, instead of a <lb/>
part of her clothes, and could do things all by <lb/>
themselves when she was outside of them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy did not need to copyright the sen- <lb/>
<pb n="208"/>
tence just quoted, its English would protect it. <lb/>
None but she would have shovelled that com- <lb/>
ically superfluous "all" in there.</p>
<p>The former Unpardonable Sin has gone out <lb/>
of service. We may frame the new Christian <lb/>
Science one thus:</p>
<p>"Whatsoever Member shall think, and with- <lb/>
out Our Mother's permission act upon his think, <lb/>
the same shall be cut off from the Church for- <lb/>
ever."</p>
<p>It has been said that I make many mistakes <lb/>
about Christian Science through being ignorant <lb/>
of the spiritual meanings of its terminology. I <lb/>
believe it is true. I have been misled all this <lb/>
time by that word Member, because there was <lb/>
no one to tell me that its spiritual meaning was <lb/>
Slave.</p>

<p>There is a By-law which forbids Members to <lb/>
practise hypnotism; the penalty is excommuni- <lb/>
cation.</p>

<item>3. By the Pastor Emeritus, and by <i>none else;</i></item>
<item>4. No member is allowed to make complaint <lb/>
to <i>her</i> in the matter;</item>
<item>5. <i>Upon Mrs. Eddy's mere "complaint"&#x2014; <lb/>
unbacked by evidence or proof, and without giving <lb/>
the accused a chance to be heard</i>&#x2014;"his name shall <lb/>
be dropped from this Church."</item>
</list>
<p>Mrs. Eddy has only to <i>say</i> a member is guilty <lb/>
&#x2014;that is all. That ends it. It is not a case of <lb/>
he "may" be cut off from Christian Science sal- <lb/>
vation, it is a case of he "<i>shall</i>" be. Her serfs <lb/>
must see to it, and not say a word.</p>
<p>Does the other Pope possess this prodigious <lb/>
and irresponsible power? Certainly not in our <lb/>
day.</p>
<p>Some may be curious to know how Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
<i>finds out</i> that a member is practising hypnotism, <lb/>
since no one is allowed to come before her throne <lb/>
and accuse him. She has explained this in <lb/>
<i>Christian Science History</i>, first and second edi- <lb/>
tions, page 16:</p>
<p>"I possess <i>a spiritual sense of what the ma- <lb/>
licious mental practitioner is mentally arguing</i> <lb/>
which cannot be deceived; I can discern in the <lb/>
<pb n="210"/>
human mind thoughts, motives, and purposes; <lb/>
and neither mental arguments nor psychic <lb/>
power can affect this spiritual insight."</p>
<p>A marvellous woman; with a hunger for pow- <lb/>
er such as has never been seen in the world be- <lb/>
fore. No thing, little or big, that contains any <lb/>
seed or suggestion of power escapes her avari- <lb/>
cious eye; and when once she gets that eye on <lb/>
it, her remorseless grip follows. There isn't a <lb/>
Christian Scientist who isn't ecclesiastically as <lb/>
much her property as if she had bought him <lb/>
and paid for him, and copyrighted him and got <lb/>
a charter. She cannot be satisfied when she <lb/>
has handcuffed a member, and put a leg-chain <lb/>
and ball on him and plugged his ears and re- <lb/>
moved his thinker, she goes on wrapping need- <lb/>
less chains round and round him, just as a <lb/>
spider would. For she trusts no one, believes <lb/>
in no one's honesty, judges every one by her- <lb/>
self. Although we have seen that she has ab- <lb/>
solute and irresponsible command over her <lb/>
spectral Boards and over every official and ser- <lb/>
vant of her Church, at home and abroad, over <lb/>
every minute detail of her Church's govern- <lb/>
<pb n="211"/>
ment, <i>present and future</i>, and can purge her <lb/>
membership of guilty or suspected persons by <lb/>
various plausible formalities and whenever she <lb/>
will, she is still not content, but must set her <lb/>
queer mind to work and invent a way by which <lb/>
she can take a member&#x2014;any member&#x2014;by neck <lb/>
and crop and fling him out without anything <lb/>
resembling a formality at all.</p>
<p><i>She is sole <foreign lang="fre">accuser</foreign> and sole witness, and her <lb/>
testimony is final and carries uncompromising <lb/>
and irremediable doom with it</i>.</p>
<p>The Sole-Witness Court! It should make the <lb/>
Council of Ten and the Council of Three turn in <lb/>
their graves for shame, to see how little they <lb/>
knew about satanic concentrations of irre- <lb/>
sponsible power. Here we have one <foreign lang="fre">Accuser,</foreign> <lb/>
one Witness, one Judge, one Headsman&#x2014;and <lb/>
all four bunched together in Mrs. Eddy, the In- <lb/>
spired of God, His Latest Thought to His Peo- <lb/>
ple, New Member of the Holy Family, the <lb/>
Equal of Jesus.</p>
<p>When a Member is not satisfactory to Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy, and yet is blameless in his life and fault- <lb/>
less in his membership and in his Christian <lb/>
Science walk and conversation, shall he hold <lb/>
<pb n="212"/>
up his head and tilt his hat over one ear and <lb/>
imagine himself safe because of these perfec- <lb/>
tions? Why, in that very moment Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
will cast that spiritual X-ray of hers through <lb/>
his dungarees and say:</p>
<p>"I see his hypnotism working, among his in- <lb/>
sides&#x2014;remove him to the block!"</p>
<p>What shall it profit him to know it isn't so? <lb/>
Nothing. His testimony is of no value. No <lb/>
one wants it, no one will ask for it. He is not <lb/>
present to offer it (he does not know he has <lb/>
been accused), and if he were there to offer it, it <lb/>
would not be listened to.</p>
<p>It was out of powers approaching Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
&#x2014;though not equalling them&#x2014;that the Inquisi- <lb/>
tion and the devastations of the Interdict grew. <lb/>
She will transmit hers. The man born two <lb/>
centuries from now will think he has arrived in <lb/>
hell; and all in good time he will think he knows <lb/>
it. Vast concentrations of irresponsible power <lb/>
have never in any age been used mercifully, and <lb/>
there is nothing to suggest that the Christian <lb/>
Science Papacy is going to spend money on <lb/>
novelties.</p>
<p>Several Christian Scientists have asked me <lb/>
<pb n="213"/>
to refrain from prophecy. There <i>is</i> no prophecy <lb/>
in our day but history. But history is a trust- <lb/>
worthy prophet. History is always repeating <lb/>
itself, because <i>conditions</i> are always repeating <lb/>
themselves. Out of duplicated conditions his- <lb/>
tory always gets a duplicate product.</p>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>reading letters at meetings</smcap></head>
<p>I wonder if there is anything a Member <i>can</i> <lb/>
do that will not raise Mrs. Eddy's jealousy? <lb/>
The By-laws seem to hunt him from pillar to <lb/>
post all the time, and turn all his thoughts and <lb/>
acts and words into sins against the meek and <lb/>
lowly new deity of his worship. Apparently <lb/>
her jealousy never sleeps. Apparently any tri- <lb/>
fle can offend it, and but one penalty appease <lb/>
it&#x2014;excommunication. The By - laws might <lb/>
properly and reasonably be entitled Laws for <lb/>
the Coddling and Comforting of Our Mother's <lb/>
Petty Jealousies. The By-law named at the <lb/>
head of this paragraph reads its transgressor <lb/>
out of the Church if he shall carry a letter from <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy to the congregation and forget to <lb/>
read it or fail to read the whole of it.</p>

<p>This looks as if Mrs. Eddy had devoted a <lb/>
large share of her time and talent to inventing <lb/>
ways to get rid of her Church members. Yet <lb/>
in another place she seems to invite member- <lb/>
ship. Not in any urgent way, it is true, still <lb/>
she throws out a bait to such as like notice and <lb/>
distinction (in other words, the Human Race). <lb/>

<p><i>The Hymnal</i>. There is a Christian Science <lb/>
Hymnal. Entrance to it was closed in 1898. <lb/>
Christian Science students who make hymns <lb/>
<pb n="216"/>
nowadays may possibly get them sung in the <lb/>
Mother-Church, "<i>but not unless approved by the <lb/>
Pastor Emeritus</i>." Art. XXVII., Sec. 2.</p>
<p><i>Solo Singers</i>. Mrs. Eddy has contributed the <lb/>
words of three of the hymns in the Hymnal. <lb/>
Two of them appear in it six times altogether, <lb/>
each of them being set to three original forms of <lb/>
musical anguish. Mrs. Eddy, always thought- <lb/>
ful, has promulgated a By-law requiring the <lb/>
singing of one of her three hymns in the Mother- <lb/>
Church "as often as once each month." It is a <lb/>
good idea. A congregation could get tired of <lb/>
even Mrs. Eddy's muse in the course of time, <lb/>
without the cordializing incentive of compul- <lb/>
sion. We all know how wearisome the sweet- <lb/>
est and touchingest things can become, through <lb/>
rep-rep-repetition, and still rep-rep-repetition, <lb/>
and more rep-rep-repetition&#x2014;like "the sweet <lb/>
by-and-by, <i>in</i> the sweet by-and-by," for in- <lb/>
stance, and "Tah-rah-rah boom-de-aye"; and <lb/>
surely it is not likely that Mrs. Eddy's machine <lb/>
has turned out goods that could outwear those <lb/>
great heart-stirrers, without the assistance of <lb/>
the lash. "O'er Waiting Harpstrings of the <lb/>
Mind" is pretty good, quite fair to middling&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="217"/>
the whole seven of the stanzas&#x2014;but repetition <lb/>
would be certain to take the excitement out of <lb/>
it in the course of time, even if there were four- <lb/>
teen, and then it would sound like the multipli- <lb/>
cation table, and would cease to save. The <lb/>
congregation would be perfectly sure to get <lb/>
tired; in fact, <i>did</i> get tired&#x2014;hence the compul- <lb/>
sory By-law. It is a measure born of experi- <lb/>
ence, not foresight.</p>
<p>The By-laws say that "if a solo singer shall <lb/>
neglect or refuse to sing alone" one of those <lb/>
three hymns as often as once a month, and <lb/>
oftener if so directed by the Board of Directors <lb/>
&#x2014;which is Mrs. Eddy&#x2014;the singer's salary shall <lb/>
be stopped. It is circumstantial evidence that <lb/>
some soloists neglected this sacrament and <lb/>
others refused it. At least that is the charita- <lb/>
ble view to take of it. There is only one other <lb/>
view to take: that Mrs. Eddy did really foresee <lb/>
that there would be singers who would some <lb/>
day get tired of doing her hymns and proclaim- <lb/>
ing the authorship, unless persuaded by a By- <lb/>
law, with a penalty attached. The idea could <lb/>
of course occur to her wise head, for she would <lb/>
know that a seven-stanza break might well be a <lb/>
<pb n="218"/>
calamitous strain upon a soloist, and that he <lb/>
might therefore avoid it if unwatched. He <lb/>
could not curtail it, for the whole of anything <lb/>
that Mrs. Eddy does is sacred, and cannot be <lb/>
cut.</p>

<p>It consists of four members, one of whom is <lb/>

<p>Mrs. Eddy is President of the Metaphysical <lb/>

<head><smcap>board of lectureship</smcap></head>
<p>The lecturers are exceedingly important ser- <lb/>
vants of Mrs. Eddy, and she chooses them with <lb/>
great care. Each of them has an appointed <lb/>
territory in which to perform his duties&#x2014;in <lb/>
the North, the South, the East, the West, in <lb/>
Canada, in Great Britain, and so on&#x2014;and each <lb/>
must stick to his own territory and not forage <lb/>
beyond its boundaries. I think it goes without <lb/>
saying&#x2014;from what we have seen of Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
&#x2014;that no lecture is delivered until she has ex- <lb/>
amined and approved it, and that the lecturer <lb/>
is not allowed to change it afterwards.</p>
<p>The members of the Board of Lectureship are <lb/>

<p>There are but four. They are elected&#x2014;like <lb/>

I can discover, not a single servant of the Sacred <lb/>

<p>That useless edict is repeated in the little <lb/>

<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>copyright</smcap></head>
<p>I can understand why Mrs. Eddy copyrighted <lb/>
the early editions and revisions of <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i>, and why she had a mania for copy- <lb/>
righting every scrap of every sort that came <lb/>
from her pen in those jejune days when to be <lb/>
in print probably seemed a wonderful distinc- <lb/>
tion to her in her provincial obscurity, but why <lb/>
she should continue this delirium in these days <lb/>
of her godship and her far-spread fame, I can- <lb/>
not explain to myself. And particularly as re- <lb/>
gards <i>Science and Health</i>. She knows, now, <lb/>
that that Annex is going to live for many cen- <lb/>
turies; and so, what good is a fleeting forty- <lb/>
two-year copyright going to do it?</p>
<p>Now a <i>perpetual</i> copyright would be quite <lb/>
another matter. I would like to give her a hint. <lb/>
Let her strike for a perpetual copyright on that <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
book. There is precedent for it. There is one <lb/>
book in the world which bears the charmed life <lb/>
of perpetual copyright (a fact not known to <lb/>
twenty people in the world). By a hardy per- <lb/>
version of privilege on the part of the law- <lb/>
making power the Bible has perpetual copy- <lb/>
right in Great Britain. There is no justification <lb/>
for it in fairness, and no explanation of it except <lb/>
that the Church is strong enough there to have <lb/>
its way, right or wrong. The recent Revised <lb/>
Version enjoys perpetual copyright, too&#x2014;a <lb/>
stronger precedent, even, than the other one.</p>
<p>Now, then, what is the Annex but a Revised <lb/>
Version itself? Which of course it is&#x2014;Lord's <lb/>
Prayer and all. With that pair of formidable <lb/>
British precedents to proceed upon, what Con- <lb/>
gress of ours&#x2014;</p>
<p>But how short-sighted I am. Mrs. Eddy has <lb/>
thought of it long ago. She thinks of every- <lb/>
thing. She knows she has only to keep her <lb/>
copyright of 1902 alive through its first stage of <lb/>
twenty-eight years, and perpetuity is assured. <lb/>
A Christian Science Congress will reign in the <lb/>
Capitol then. She probably attaches small value <lb/>
to the first edition (1875). Although it was a <lb/>
<pb n="223"/>
Revelation from on high, it was slim, lank, in- <lb/>
complete, padded with bales of refuse rags, and <lb/>
puffs from lassoed celebrities to fill it out, an <lb/>
uncreditable book, a book easily sparable, a <lb/>
book not to be mentioned in the same year with <lb/>
the sleek, fat, concise, compact, compressed, <lb/>
and competent Annex of to-day, in its dainty <lb/>
flexible covers, gilt - edges, rounded corners, <lb/>
twin screw, spiral twist, compensation balance, <lb/>
Testament-counterfeit, and all that; a book <lb/>
just born to curl up on the hymn-book-shelf <lb/>
in church and look just too sweet and holy for <lb/>
anything. Yes, I see now what she was copy- <lb/>
righting that child for.</p>

<p>It is true&#x2014;in matters of business Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
thinks of everything. She thought of an organ, <lb/>
to disseminate the Truth as it was in Mrs. Eddy. <lb/>
Straightway she started one&#x2014;the <i>Christian <lb/>
Science Journal.</i></p>
<p>It is true&#x2014;in matters of business Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
thinks of everything. As soon as she had got <lb/>
the <i>Christian Science Journal</i> sufficiently in <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
debt to make its presence on the premises dis <lb/>
agreeable to her, it occurred to her to make <lb/>
somebody a present of it. Which she did, <lb/>
along with its debts. It was in the summer of <lb/>
1889. The victim selected was her Church&#x2014; <lb/>
called, in those days, The National Christian <lb/>
Scientist Association.</p>
<p>She delivered this sorrow to those lambs as <lb/>
a "gift" in consideration of their "loyalty to <lb/>
our great cause."</p>
<p>Also&#x2014;still thinking of everything&#x2014;she told <lb/>
them to retain Mr. Bailey in the editorship and <lb/>
make Mr. Nixon publisher. We do not know <lb/>
what it was she had against those men; neither <lb/>
do we know whether she scored on Bailey or <lb/>
not, we only know that God protected Nixon, <lb/>
and for that I am sincerely glad, although I do <lb/>
not know Nixon and have never even seen <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>Nixon took the <i>Journal</i> and the rest of the <lb/>
Publishing Society's liabilities, and demon- <lb/>
strated over them during three years, then <lb/>
brought in his report:</p>
<p>"On assuming my duties as publisher, there <lb/>
was not a dollar in the treasury; but on the con- <lb/>
<pb n="225"/>
trary the Society owed unpaid printing and <lb/>
paper bills to the amount of several hundred <lb/>
dollars, not to mention a contingent liability of <lb/>
many more hundreds"&#x2014;represented by ad- <lb/>
vance-subscriptions paid for the <i>Journal</i> and <lb/>
the "Series," the which goods Mrs. Eddy had <lb/>
not delivered. And couldn't, very well, per- <lb/>
haps, on a Metaphysical College income of but <lb/>
a few thousand dollars a day, or a week, or <lb/>
whatever it was in those magnificently flourish- <lb/>
ing times. The struggling <i>Journal</i> had swal- <lb/>
lowed up those advance - payments, but its <lb/>
"claim" was a severe one and they had failed <lb/>
to cure it. But Nixon cured it in his diligent <lb/>
three years, and joyously reported the news <lb/>
that he had cleared off all the debts and now <lb/>
had a fat six thousand dollars in the bank.</p>
<p>It made Mrs. Eddy's mouth water.</p>
<p>At the time that Mrs. Eddy had unloaded <lb/>
that dismal gift on to her National Association, <lb/>
she had followed her inveterate custom: she <lb/>
had tied a string to its hind leg, and kept one <lb/>
end of it hitched to her belt. We have seen her <lb/>
do that in the case of the Boston Mosque. <lb/>
When she deeds property, she puts in that <lb/>
<pb n="226"/>
string-clause. It provides that under certain <lb/>
conditions she can pull the string and land the <lb/>
property in the cherished home of its happy <lb/>
youth. In the present case she believed that <lb/>
she had made provision that if at any time the <lb/>
National Christian Science Association should <lb/>
dissolve itself by a formal vote, she could pull.</p>
<p>A year after Nixon's handsome report, she <lb/>
writes the Association that she has a "unique <lb/>
request to lay before it." It has dissolved, and <lb/>
she is not quite sure that the <i>Christian Science <lb/>
Journal</i> has "already fallen into her hands" by <lb/>
that act, though it "seems" to her to have met <lb/>
with that accident; so she would like to have <lb/>
the matter decided by a formal vote. But <lb/>
whether there is a doubt or not, "I see the <lb/>
wisdom," she says, "of again owning this Chris- <lb/>
tian Science waif."</p>
<p>I think that that is unassailable evidence that <lb/>
the waif was making money, hands down.</p>
<p>She pulled her gift in. A few years later she <lb/>
donated the Publishing Society, along with its <lb/>
real estate, its buildings, its plant, its publica- <lb/>
tions, and its money&#x2014;the whole worth twenty- <lb/>
two thousand dollars, and free of debt&#x2014;to&#x2014;</p>
<pb n="227"/>
<p>Well, <i>to the Mother-Church!</i></p>
<p>That is to say, to herself. There is an ac- <lb/>
count of it in the <i>Christian Science Journal</i>, and <lb/>
of how she had already made some other hand- <lb/>
some gifts&#x2014;to her Church&#x2014;and others to&#x2014;to <lb/>
her Cause&#x2014;besides "an almost countless num- <lb/>
ber of private charities" of cloudy amount and <lb/>
otherwise indefinite. This landslide of gener- <lb/>
osities overwhelmed one of her literary do- <lb/>
mestics. While he was in that condition he <lb/>
tried to express what he felt:</p>
<p>"Let us endeavor to lift up our hearts in <lb/>
thankfulness to &#x2026; our Mother in Israel for <lb/>
these evidences of generosity and self-sac- <lb/>
rifice that appeal to our deepest sense of <lb/>
gratitude, even while surpassing our compre- <lb/>
hension."</p>
<p>A year or two later, Mrs. Eddy promulgated <lb/>
some By-laws of a self-sacrificing sort which <lb/>
assuaged him, perhaps, and perhaps enabled <lb/>
his surpassed comprehension to make a sprint <lb/>
and catch up. These are to be found in Art. <lb/>

<p>The profits go semi-annually to the Treasurer <lb/>
of the Mother - Church. <i>Mrs. Eddy owns the <lb/>

<p>Editors and publishers of the <i>Christian <lb/>

the Board of Directors"&#x2014;which is surplusage, <lb/>
since Mrs. Eddy owns the Board.</p>
<p>If at any time a weekly shall be started, "<i>it <lb/>

<p><smcap>I think</smcap> that any one who will carefully ex- <lb/>
amine the By-laws (I have placed all of the <lb/>
important ones before the reader), will arrive <lb/>
at the conclusion that of late years the master- <lb/>
passion in Mrs. Eddy's heart is a hunger for <lb/>
power and glory; and that while her hunger for <lb/>
money still remains, she wants it now for the <lb/>
expansion and extension it can furnish to that <lb/>
power and glory, rather than what it can do for <lb/>
her towards satisfying minor and meaner am- <lb/>
bitions.</p>
<p>I wish to enlarge a little upon this matter. I <lb/>
think it is quite clear that the reason why Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy has concentrated in herself all powers, <lb/>
all distinctions, all revenues that are within the <lb/>
command of the Christian Science Church Uni- <lb/>
versal is that she desires and intends to devote <lb/>
them to the purpose just suggested&#x2014;the up- <lb/>
building of her personal glory&#x2014;hers, and no <lb/>
one else's; that, and the continuing of her <lb/>
<pb n="230"/>
name's glory after she shall have passed away. <lb/>
<i>If she has overlooked a single power, howsoever <lb/>
minute, I cannot discover it. If she has found <lb/>
one, large or small, which she has not seized and <lb/>
made her own, there is no record of it, no trace of <lb/>
it</i>. In her foragings and depredations she usu- <lb/>
ally puts forward the Mother - Church&#x2014;a lay <lb/>
figure&#x2014;and hides behind it. Whereas, she is in <lb/>
manifest reality the Mother-Church herself. It <lb/>
has an impressive array of officials, and com- <lb/>
mittees, and Boards of Direction, of Educa- <lb/>
tion, of Lectureship, and so on&#x2014;geldings, every <lb/>
one, shadows, spectres, apparitions, wax - fig- <lb/>
ures: she is supreme over them all, she can <lb/>
abolish them when she will; blow them out as <lb/>
she would a candle. She is herself the Mother- <lb/>
Church. Now there is one By-law which says <lb/>
that the Mother-Church</p>
<p><i>"shall be officially controlled by no other <lb/>
church."</i></p>
<p>That does not surprise us&#x2014;we know by the <lb/>
rest of the By-laws that that is a quite irrele- <lb/>
vant remark. Yet we do vaguely and hazily <lb/>
<pb n="231"/>
wonder why she takes the trouble to say it; <lb/>
why she wastes the words; what her object can <lb/>
be&#x2014;seeing that that emergency has been in so <lb/>
many, many ways, and so effectively and dras- <lb/>
tically barred off and made impossible. Then <lb/>
presently the object begins to dawn upon us. <lb/>
That is, it does after we have read the rest of <lb/>
the By-law three or four times, wondering and <lb/>
admiring to see Mrs. Eddy&#x2014;Mrs. Eddy&#x2014;Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy, of all persons&#x2014;throwing away power!&#x2014; <lb/>
making a fair exchange&#x2014;doing a fair thing for <lb/>
once&#x2014;more, an almost generous thing! Then <lb/>
we look it through yet once more&#x2014;unsatisfied, <lb/>
a little suspicious&#x2014;and find that it is nothing <lb/>
but a sly, thin make-believe, and that even the <lb/>
very title of it is a sarcasm and embodies a <lb/>
falsehood&#x2014;"self" government:</p>
<p><i>"Local Self-Government</i>. The First Church <lb/>
of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts, <lb/>
shall assume no official control of other churches <lb/>
of this denomination. It shall be officially con- <lb/>
trolled by no other church."</p>
<p>It has a most pious and deceptive give-and- <lb/>
take air of perfect fairness, unselfishness, mag- <lb/>
<pb n="232"/>
nanimity&#x2014;almost godliness, indeed. But it is <lb/>
all art.</p>
<p>In the By-laws, Mrs. Eddy, speaking by the <lb/>
mouth of her other self, the Mother - Church, <lb/>
proclaims that she will assume no official con- <lb/>
trol of other churches&#x2014;branch churches. We <lb/>
examine the other By-laws, and they answer <lb/>
some important questions for us:</p>
<list>
<item>1. What <i>is</i> a branch Church? It is a body <lb/>
of Christian Scientists, organized in the one <lb/>
and only permissible way&#x2014;by a member, in <lb/>
good standing, of the Mother - Church, and <lb/>
who is also a pupil of one of Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
accredited students. That is to say, one of <lb/>
her properties. <i>No other can do it</i>. There <lb/>
are other indispensable requisites; what are <lb/>
they?</item>
<item>2. The new Church cannot enter upon its <lb/>
functions until its members have individually <lb/>
signed, and pledged allegiance to a <i>Creed fur- <lb/>
nished by Mrs. Eddy.</i></item>
<item>3. <i>They are obliged to study her books, and <lb/>
order their lives by them</i>. And they must read <lb/>
<i>no outside religious works.</i></item>
<item>4. <i>They must sing the hymns and pray the</i> <lb/>
<pb n="233"/>
<i>prayers provided by her</i>, and use no others in <lb/>
the services, except by her permission.</item>
<item>5. They cannot have preachers and pastors. <lb/>
<i>Her law.</i></item>
<item>6. In their Church they must have two Read- <lb/>
ers&#x2014;a man and a woman.</item>
<item>7. They must read the services framed and <lb/>
appointed by <i>her.</i></item>
<item>8. <i>She</i>&#x2014;not the branch Church&#x2014;<i>appoints</i> <lb/>
those Readers.</item>
<item>9. <i>She</i>&#x2014;not the branch Church&#x2014;<i>dismisses</i> <lb/>
them and <i>fills the vacancies.</i></item>
<item>10. She can do this <i>without consulting the <lb/>
branch Church, and without explaining.</i></item>
<item>11. The branch Church can have a religious <lb/>
lecture from time to time. <i>By applying to <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy</i>. There is no other way.</item>
<item>12. But the branch Church cannot select the <lb/>
lecturer. <i>Mrs. Eddy does it.</i></item>
<item>13. The branch Church pays his fee.</item>
<item>14. The harnessing of all Christian Science <lb/>
wedding-teams, members of the branch Church, <lb/>
must be done by duly authorized and conse- <lb/>
crated Christian Science functionaries. <i>Her fac- <lb/>
tory is the only one that makes and licenses them.</i></item>
<pb n="234"/>
<item>[15. Nothing is said about christenings. It <lb/>
is inferable from this that a Christian Science <lb/>
child is born a Christian Scientist and requires <lb/>
no tinkering.</item>
<item>[16. Nothing is said about funerals. It is <lb/>
inferable, then, that a branch Church is priv- <lb/>
ileged to do in that matter as it may choose.]</item>
</list>
<p>To sum up. Are <i>any</i> important Church- <lb/>
functions absent from the list? I cannot call <lb/>
any to mind. Are there any lacking ones <lb/>
whose exercise could make the branch in any <lb/>
noticeable way independent of the Mother- <lb/>
Church?&#x2014;even in any trifling degree? I think <lb/>
of none. If the named functions were abol- <lb/>
ished would there still be a Church left? Would <lb/>
there be even a shadow of a Church left? <lb/>
Would there be anything at all left?&#x2014;even the <lb/>
bare <i>name?</i></p>
<p>Manifestly not. There isn't a single vital <lb/>
and essential Church-function of any kind, that <lb/>
is not named in the list. And over every one <lb/>
of them the Mother-Church has permanent and <lb/>
unchallengeable control, upon every one of <lb/>
them Mrs. Eddy has set her irremovable grip. <lb/>
<i>She holds, in perpetuity, autocratic and indis-</i> <lb/>
<pb n="235"/>
<i>putable sovereignty and control over every branch <lb/>
Church in the earth;</i> and yet says, in that sugary, <lb/>
na&#x00EF;ve, angel-beguiling way of hers, that the <lb/>
Mother-Church</p>
<p><i>"shall assume no official control of other <lb/>
churches of this denomination."</i></p>
<p>Whereas in truth the unmeddled-with lib- <lb/>
erties of a branch Christian Science Church are <lb/>
but very, very few in number, and are these:</p>
<list>
<item>1. It can appoint its own furnace - stoker, <lb/>
winters.</item>
<item>2. It can appoint its own fan-distributors, <lb/>
summers.</item>
<item>3. It can, in accordance with its own choice <lb/>
in the matter, burn, bury, or preserve members <lb/>
who are pretending to be dead&#x2014;whereas there <lb/>
is no such thing as death.</item>
<item>4. It can take up a collection.</item>
</list>
<p>The branch Churches have <i>no</i> important lib- <lb/>
erties, none that give them an important voice <lb/>
in their own affairs. Those are all locked up, <lb/>
and Mrs. Eddy has the key. "Local Self-Gov- <lb/>
ernment" is a large name and sounds well; but <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
the branch Churches have no more of it than <lb/>
have the privates in the King of Dahomey's <lb/>
army.</p>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>"mother-church unique"</smcap></head>
<p>Mrs. Eddy, with an envious and admiring <lb/>
eye upon the solitary and rivalless and world- <lb/>
shadowing majesty of St. Peter's, reveals in her <lb/>
By-laws her purpose to set the Mother-Church <lb/>
apart by itself in a stately seclusion and make <lb/>
it duplicate that lone sublimity under the West- <lb/>
ern sky. The By-law headed "Mother-Church <lb/>
Unique" says&#x2014;</p>
<p>"In its relation to other Christian Science <lb/>
churches, the Mother-Church stands alone.</p>
<p>"It occupies a position that no other Church <lb/>
can fill.</p>
<p>"Then for a branch Church to assume such po- <lb/>
sition would be disastrous to Christian Science.</p>
<p>"Therefore&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Therefore no branch Church is allowed to <lb/>
have branches. There shall be no Christian <lb/>
Science St. Peter's in the earth but just one&#x2014; <lb/>
the Mother-Church in Boston.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<pb n="237"/>
<head><smcap>"no first members"</smcap></head>
<p>But for the thoughtful By-law thus entitled, <lb/>
every Science branch in the earth would imi- <lb/>
tate the Mother-Church and set up an aristoc- <lb/>
racy. Every little group of ground-floor Smiths <lb/>
and Furgusons and Shadwells and Simpsons <lb/>
that organized a branch would assume that <lb/>
great title, of "First Members," along with its <lb/>
vast privileges of "discussing" the weather and <lb/>
casting blank ballots, and soon there would be <lb/>
such a locust-plague of them burdening the <lb/>
globe that the title would lose its value and <lb/>
have to be abolished.</p>
<p>But where business and glory are concerned, <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy thinks of everything, and so she did <lb/>
not fail to take care of her Aborigines, her state- <lb/>
ly and exclusive One Hundred, her college of <lb/>
functionless cardinals, her Sanhedrin of Priv- <lb/>
ileged Talkers (Limited). After taking away <lb/>
<i>all</i> the liberties of the branch Churches, and in <lb/>
the same breath disclaiming all official control <lb/>
over their affairs, she smites them on the mouth <lb/>
with this&#x2014;the very mouth that was watering <lb/>
for those nobby ground-floor honors&#x2014;</p>
<pb n="238"/>
<p>"<i>No First Members</i>. Branch Churches shall <lb/>
not organize with First Members, that special <lb/>
method of organization being adapted to the <lb/>
Mother-Church alone."</p>
<p>And so, first members being prohibited, we <lb/>
pierce through the cloud of Mrs. Eddy's Eng- <lb/>
lish and perceive that they must then necessar- <lb/>
ily organize with Subsequent Members. There <lb/>
is no other way. It will occur to them by-and- <lb/>
by to found an aristocracy of Early Subsequent <lb/>
Members. There is no By-law against it.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head>"THE"</head>
<p>I uncover to that imperial word. And to the <lb/>
mind, too, that conceived the idea of seizing <lb/>
and monopolizing it as a title. I believe it is <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy's dazzlingest invention. For show, <lb/>
and style, and grandeur, and thunder and <lb/>
lightning and fireworks it outclasses all the pre- <lb/>
vious inventions of man, and raises the limit on <lb/>
the Pope. He can never put his avid hand on <lb/>
that word of words&#x2014;it is pre-empted. And <lb/>
copyrighted, of course. It lifts the Mother- <lb/>
<pb n="239"/>
Church away up in the sky, and fellowships it <lb/>
with the rare and select and exclusive little <lb/>
company of the THE's of deathless glory&#x2014;per- <lb/>
sons and things whereof history and the ages <lb/>
could furnish only single examples, not two: <i>the</i> <lb/>
Saviour, <i>the</i> Virgin, <i>the</i> Milky Way, <i>the</i> Bible, <i>the</i> <lb/>
Earth, <i>the</i> Equator, <i>the</i> Devil, <i>the</i> Missing Link <lb/>
&#x2014;and now <i>The</i> First Church, Scientist. And <lb/>
by clamor of edict and By-law Mrs. Eddy gives <lb/>
personal notice to all branch Scientist Churches <lb/>
on this planet to leave that THE alone.</p>
<p>She has demonstrated over it and made it <lb/>
sacred to the Mother-Church:</p>
<p>"<i>The article 'The' must not be used before the <lb/>
titles of branch Churches&#x2014;</i></p>
<p>"Nor written on applications for membership <lb/>
in naming such churches."</p>
<p>Those are the terms. There can and will be <lb/>
a million First Churches of Christ, Scientist, <lb/>
scattered over the world, in a million towns and <lb/>
villages and hamlets and cities, and each may <lb/>
call itself (suppressing the article), "First <lb/>
Church of Christ, Scientist"&#x2014;it is permissible, <lb/>
<pb n="240"/>
and no harm; but there is only one <i>The</i> Church <lb/>
of Christ, Scientist, and there will never be an- <lb/>
other. And whether that great word fall in <lb/>
the middle of a sentence or at the beginning of <lb/>
it, it must always have its capital T.</p>
<p>I do not suppose that a juvenile passion for <lb/>
fussy little worldly shows and vanities can fur- <lb/>
nish a match to this, anywhere in the history <lb/>
of the nursery. Mrs. Eddy does seem to be a <lb/>
shade fonder of little special distinctions and <lb/>
pomps than is usual with human beings.</p>
<p>She instituted that immodest "The" with <lb/>
her own hand; she did not wait for somebody <lb/>
else to think of it.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>a life-term monopoly</smcap></head>
<p>There is but <i>one</i> human Pastor in the whole <lb/>
Christian Science world; she reserves that ex- <lb/>
alted place to herself.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>a perpetual one</smcap></head>
<p>There is but <i>one other</i> object in the whole <lb/>
Christian Science world honored with that title <lb/>
and holding that office: it is her <i>book</i>, the Annex <lb/>
<pb n="241"/>
&#x2014;<i>permanent Pastor of The First Church, and of <lb/>
all branch Churches</i>.</p>
<p>With her own hand she draughted the By- <lb/>
laws which make her the only really absolute <lb/>
sovereign that lives to-day in Christendom.<ref target="n34"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n34" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Even that ideal representative of irresponsible power, <lb/>
the General of the Jesuits, is not in the running with <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy. He is authentically described as follows:</p>
<p>"The Society of Jesus has really but one head, the Gen- <lb/>
eral. He must be a professed Jesuit of the four vows, and it <lb/>
is the professed Jesuits of the four vows only who take part <lb/>
in his election, which is by secret ballot. He has four 'assist- <lb/>
ants' to help him, and an 'admonisher,' elected in the same <lb/>
way as himself, to keep him in, or, if need be, to bring him <lb/>
back to the right path. The electors of the General have <lb/>
the right of <i>deposing</i> him if he is guilty of a serious fault."</p></note></p>
<p>She does not allow any objectionable pictures <lb/>
to be exhibited in the room where her book is <lb/>
sold, nor any indulgence in idle gossip there; <lb/>
and from the general look of that By - law I <lb/>
judge that a lightsome and improper person <lb/>
can be as uncomfortable in that place as he <lb/>
could be in heaven.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>the sanctum sanctorum and sacred chair</smcap></head>
<p>In a room in The First Church of Christ, <lb/>
Scientist, there is a museum of objects which <lb/>
<pb n="242"/>
have attained to holiness through contact with <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy&#x2014;among them an electrically lighted <lb/>
oil-picture of a <i>chair</i> which she used to sit in&#x2014; <lb/>
and disciples from all about the world go softly <lb/>
in there, in restricted groups, under proper <lb/>
guard, and reverently gaze upon those relics. <lb/>
It is worship. Mrs. Eddy could stop it if she <lb/>
was not fond of it, for her sovereignty over that <lb/>
temple is supreme.</p>
<p>The fitting-up of that place as a shrine is not <lb/>
an accident, nor a casual, unweighed idea; it is <lb/>
imitated from age-old religious custom. In <lb/>
Treves the pilgrim reverently gazes upon the <lb/>
Seamless Robe, and humbly worships; and does <lb/>
the same in that other continental church <lb/>
where they keep a duplicate; and does likewise <lb/>
in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in Jeru- <lb/>
salem, where memorials of the Crucifixion are <lb/>
preserved; and now, by good fortune we have <lb/>
our Holy Chair and things, and a market for our <lb/>
adorations nearer home.</p>
<p>But is there not a detail that is new, fresh, <lb/>
original? Yes, whatever old thing Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
touches gets something new by the contact&#x2014; <lb/>
something not thought of before by any one&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="243"/>
something original, all her own, and copyright- <lb/>
able. The new feature is <i>self</i> worship&#x2014;exhib- <lb/>
ited in permitting this shrine to be installed <lb/>
during her lifetime, and winking her sacred eye <lb/>
at it.</p>
<p>A prominent Christian Scientist has assured <lb/>
me that the Scientists do not worship Mrs. Eddy, <lb/>
and I think it likely that there may be five or <lb/>
six of the cult in the world who do not worship <lb/>
her; but she herself is certainly not of that com- <lb/>
pany. Any healthy-minded person who will <lb/>
examine Mrs. Eddy's little <i>Autobiography</i> and <lb/>
the Manual of By-laws written by her will be <lb/>
convinced that she worships herself; and that <lb/>
she brings to this service a fervor of devotion <lb/>
surpassing even that which she formerly laid at <lb/>
the feet of the Dollar, and equalling any which <lb/>
rises to the Throne of Grace from any quarter.</p>
<p>I think this is as good a place as any to salve <lb/>
a hurt which I was the means of inflicting upon <lb/>
a Christian Scientist lately. The first third of <lb/>
this book was written in 1899 in Vienna. Until <lb/>
last summer I had supposed that that third <lb/>
had been printed in a book which I published <lb/>
about a year later&#x2014;a hap which had not hap- <lb/>
<pb n="244"/>
pened. I then sent the chapters composing it <lb/>
to the <i>North American Review</i>, but failed, in one <lb/>
instance, to date them. And so, in an undated <lb/>
chapter I said a lady told me "last night" so <lb/>
and so. There was nothing to indicate to the <lb/>
reader that that "last night" was several years <lb/>
old, therefore the phrase seemed to refer to a <lb/>
night of very recent date. What the lady had <lb/>
told me was, that in a part of the Mother-Church <lb/>
in Boston she had seen Scientists worshipping a <lb/>
portrait of Mrs. Eddy before which a light was <lb/>
kept constantly burning.</p>
<p>A Scientist came to me and wished me to re- <lb/>
tract that "untruth." He said there was no <lb/>
such portrait, and that if I wanted to be sure of <lb/>
it I could go to Boston and see for myself. I <lb/>
explained that my "last night" meant a good <lb/>
while ago; that I did not doubt his assertion <lb/>
that there was no such portrait there now, but <lb/>
that I should continue to believe it had been <lb/>
there at the time of the lady's visit until she <lb/>
should retract her statement herself. I was at <lb/>
no time vouching for the truth of the remark, <lb/>
nevertheless I considered it worth par.</p>
<p>And yet I am sorry the lady told me, since a <lb/>
<pb n="245"/>
wound which brings me no happiness has re- <lb/>
sulted. I am most willing to apply such salve <lb/>
as I can. The best way to set the matter right <lb/>
and make everything pleasant and agreeable all <lb/>
around will be to print in this place a descrip- <lb/>
tion of the shrine as it appeared to a recent vis- <lb/>
itor, Mr. Frederick W. Peabody, of Boston. I <lb/>
will copy his newspaper account, and the reader <lb/>
will see that Mrs. Eddy's portrait is not there <lb/>
now:</p>
<p>"We lately stood on the threshold of the <lb/>
Holy of Holies of the Mother-Church, and with <lb/>
a crowd of worshippers patiently waited for ad- <lb/>
mittance to the hallowed precincts of the <lb/>
'Mother's Room.' Over the doorway was a <lb/>
sign informing us that but four persons at a <lb/>
time would be admitted; that they would be <lb/>
permitted to remain but five minutes only, and <lb/>
would please retire from the 'Mother's Room' <lb/>
at the ringing of the bell. Entering with three <lb/>
of the faithful, we looked with profane eyes <lb/>
upon the consecrated furnishings. A show- <lb/>
woman in attendance monotonously announced <lb/>
the character of the different appointments. <lb/>
Set in a recess of the wall and illumined with <lb/>
<pb n="246"/>
electric light was an oil-painting the show- <lb/>
woman seriously declared to be a lifelike and <lb/>
realistic picture of the Chair in which the <lb/>
Mother sat when she composed her 'inspired' <lb/>
work. It was a picture of an old-fashioned, <lb/>
country, hair-cloth rocking-chair, and an ex- <lb/>
ceedingly commonplace-looking table with a <lb/>
pile of manuscript, an ink-bottle, and pen con- <lb/>
spicuously upon it. On the floor were sheets <lb/>
of manuscript. 'The mantel-piece is of pure <lb/>
onyx,' continued the show-woman, 'and the <lb/>
beehive upon the window-sill is made from one <lb/>
solid block of onyx; the rug is made of a hun- <lb/>
dred breasts of eider-down ducks, and the toilet- <lb/>
room you see in the corner is of the latest de- <lb/>
sign, with gold-plated drain-pipes; the painted <lb/>
windows are from the Mother's poem, "Christ <lb/>
and Christmas," and that case contains com- <lb/>
plete copies of all the Mother's books.' The <lb/>
chairs upon which the sacred person of the <lb/>
Mother had reposed were protected from sacri- <lb/>
legious touch by a broad band of satin ribbon. <lb/>
My companions expressed their admiration in <lb/>
subdued and reverent tones, and at the tinkling <lb/>
of the bell we reverently tiptoed out of the <lb/>

<p>Now, then, I hope the wound is healed. I <lb/>
am willing to relinquish the portrait, and com- <lb/>
promise on the Chair. At the same time, if I <lb/>
were going to worship either, I should not <lb/>
choose the Chair.</p>
<p>As a picturesquely and persistently interest- <lb/>
ing personage, there is no mate to Mrs. Eddy, <lb/>
the accepted Equal of the Saviour. But some <lb/>
of her tastes are so different from His! I find <lb/>
it quite impossible to imagine Him, in life, <lb/>
standing sponsor for that museum there, and <lb/>
taking pleasure in its sumptuous shows. I be- <lb/>
lieve He would put that Chair in the fire, and <lb/>
the bell along with it; and I think He would <lb/>
make the show-woman go away. I think He <lb/>
would break those electric bulbs, and the "man- <lb/>
tel-piece of pure onyx," and say reproachful <lb/>
things about the golden drain-pipes of the lava- <lb/>
tory, and give the costly rug of duck-breasts to <lb/>
the poor, and sever the satin ribbon and invite <lb/>
the weary to rest and ease their aches in the con- <lb/>
secrated chairs. What He would do with the <lb/>
painted windows we can better conjecture when <lb/>
we come presently to examine their peculiar- <lb/>
ities.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Eddy turned the pastors out of <lb/>
all the Christian Science churches and abolished <lb/>
the office for all time&#x2014;as far as human occu- <lb/>
pancy is concerned&#x2014;she appointed the Holy <lb/>
Ghost to fill their place. If this language be <lb/>
blasphemous, I did not invent the blasphemy, <lb/>
I am merely stating a fact. I will quote from <lb/>
page 227 of <i>Science and Health</i> (edition 1899), <lb/>
as a first step towards an explanation of this <lb/>
startling matter&#x2014;a passage which sets forth <lb/>
and classifies the Christian Science Trinity:</p>
<p>"Life, Truth, and Love constitute the triune <lb/>
God, or triply divine Principle. They repre- <lb/>
sent a trinity in unity, three in one&#x2014;the same <lb/>
in essence, though multiform in office: God the <lb/>
Father; Christ the type of Sonship; Divine <lb/>
Science, or the Holy Comforter&#x2026;.</p>
<p>"The <i>Holy Ghost</i>, or Spirit, <i>reveals</i> this triune <lb/>
Principle, and (<i>the Holy Ghost</i>) is expressed in <lb/>
<i>Divine Science</i>, which is <i>the Comforter</i>, leading <lb/>
into all Truth, and revealing the divine Prin- <lb/>
ciple of the universe&#x2014;universal and perpetual <lb/>
harmony."</p>
<pb n="249"/>
<p>I will cite another passage. Speaking of <lb/>
Jesus&#x2014;</p>
<p>"His students then <i>received the Holy Ghost.</i> <lb/>
By this is meant, that by all they had witnessed <lb/>
and suffered they were roused to an enlarged <lb/>
<i>understanding of Divine Science</i>, even to the <lb/>
<i>spiritual interpretation &#x2026; of His teachings</i>," etc.</p>
<p>Also, page 579, in the chapter called the <lb/>
Glossary:</p>
<p>"<smcap>Holy Ghost</smcap>. <i>Divine Science</i>; the devel- <lb/>
opments of Life, Truth, and Love."</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost <i>reveals</i> the massed spirit of <lb/>
the fused trinity; this massed spirit is <i>expressed</i> <lb/>
in Divine Science, and is the <i>Comforter;</i> Divine <lb/>
Science <i>conveys</i> to men the "<i>spiritual interpre- <lb/>
tation</i>" of the Saviour's teachings. That seems <lb/>
to be the meaning of the quoted passages.</p>
<p><i>Divine Science</i> is Christian Science; the book <lb/>
<i>Science and Health</i> is a "<i>revelation</i>" of the whole <lb/>
spirit of the Trinity, and is therefore "<i>The Holy <lb/>
Ghost</i>"; it conveys to men the "<i>spiritual inter- <lb/>
<pb n="250"/>
pretation</i>" of the Bible's teachings, and there- <lb/>
fore is "the <i>Comforter</i>."</p>
<p>I do not find this analyzing work easy, I <lb/>
would rather saw wood; and a person can never <lb/>
tell whether he has added up a <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i> sum right or not, anyway, after all his <lb/>
trouble. Neither can he easily find out whether <lb/>
the texts are still on the market or have been <lb/>
discarded from the Book; for two hundred and <lb/>
fifty-eight editions of it have been issued, and <lb/>
no two editions seem to be alike. The annual <lb/>
changes&#x2014;in technical terminology; in matter <lb/>
and wording; in transpositions of chapters and <lb/>
verses; in leaving out old chapters and verses <lb/>
and putting in new ones&#x2014;seem to be next to <lb/>
innumerable, and as there is no index, there is <lb/>
no way to find a thing one wants without read- <lb/>
ing the book through. If ever I inspire a Bible- <lb/>
Annex I will not rush at it in a half-digested, <lb/>
helter-skelter way and have to put in thirty- <lb/>
eight years trying to get some of it the way I <lb/>
want it, I will sit down and think it out and <lb/>
know what it is I want to say before I begin. <lb/>
An inspirer cannot inspire for Mrs. Eddy and <lb/>
keep his reputation. I have never seen such <lb/>
<pb n="251"/>
slipshod work, bar the ten that interpreted for <lb/>
the home market the "sell all thou hast." I <lb/>
have quoted one "spiritual" rendering of the <lb/>
Lord's Prayer, I have seen one other one, and <lb/>
am told there are five more.<ref target="n35"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n35" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>See a second rendering in Appendix. (Lord's Prayer.) <lb/>
&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> Yet the inspirer <lb/>
of Mrs. Eddy the new Infallible casts a compla- <lb/>
cent critical stone at the other Infallible for being <lb/>
unable to make up its mind about such things. <lb/>
<i>Science and Health</i>, edition 1899, page 33:</p>
<p>"The decisions, by vote of Church Councils, <lb/>
as to what should and should not be considered <lb/>
Holy Writ, the manifest mistakes in the ancient <lb/>
versions: the thirty thousand different readings <lb/>
in the Old Testament and the three hundred <lb/>
thousand in the New&#x2014;these facts show how a <lb/>
mortal and material sense stole into the divine <lb/>
record, darkening, to some extent, the inspired <lb/>
pages with its own hue."</p>
<p>To some extent, yes&#x2014;speaking cautiously. <lb/>
But it is nothing, really nothing; Mrs. Eddy is <lb/>
only a little way behind, and if her inspirer <lb/>
lives to get her Annex to suit him that Catholic <lb/>
<pb n="252"/>
record will have to "go 'way back and set <lb/>
down," as the ballad says. Listen to the boast- <lb/>
ful song of Mrs. Eddy's organ, the <i>Christian <lb/>
Science Journal</i> for March, 1902, about that <lb/>
year's revamping and half-soling of <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i>, whose official name is the Holy Ghost, <lb/>
the Comforter, and who is now the Official <lb/>
Pastor and Infallible and Unerring Guide of <lb/>
every Christian Science church in the two <lb/>
hemispheres, hear Simple Simon that met the <lb/>
pieman brag of the Infallible's fallibility:</p>
<p>"Throughout the entire book the verbal <lb/>
changes are so numerous as to indicate the vast <lb/>
amount of time and labor Mrs. Eddy has de- <lb/>
voted to this revision. The time and labor <lb/>
thus bestowed is relatively as great as that of <lb/>
the committee who revised the Bible&#x2026;. Thus <lb/>
we have additional evidence of the herculean ef- <lb/>
forts our beloved Leader has made and is con- <lb/>
stantly making for the promulgation of Truth <lb/>
and the furtherance of her divinely bestowed <lb/>
mission," etc.</p>
<p>It is a steady job. I could help inspire if de- <lb/>
sired; I am not doing much now, and would <lb/>

<p>The price of the Pastor-Universal, <i>Science <lb/>
and Health</i>, called in Science literature the Com- <lb/>
forter and by that other sacred Name&#x2014;is <lb/>
three dollars in cloth, as heretofore, six when it <lb/>
is finely bound, and shaped to imitate the Testa- <lb/>
ment, and is broken into verses. Margin of <lb/>
profit above cost of manufacture, from five <lb/>
hundred to seven hundred per cent., as already <lb/>
noted. In the profane subscription-trade, it <lb/>
costs the publisher heavily to canvass a three- <lb/>
dollar book; he must pay the general agent <i>sixty <lb/>
per cent</i>. commission&#x2014;that is to say, one dollar <lb/>
and eighty cents. Mrs. Eddy escapes this blister- <lb/>
ing tax, because she owns the Christian Science <lb/>
canvasser, and can compel him to work for noth- <lb/>
ing. Read the following <i>command</i>&#x2014;not request <lb/>
&#x2014;fulminated by Mrs. Eddy, over her signature, <lb/>
in the <i>Christian Science Journal</i> for March, 1897, <lb/>
and quoted by Mr. Peabody in his book. The <lb/>
book referred to is <i>Science and Health:</i></p>
<pb n="254"/>
<p><i>"It shall be the duty of all Christian Scientists <lb/>
to circulate and to sell as many of these books as <lb/>
they can."</i></p>
<p>That is flung at all the elect, everywhere <lb/>
that the sun shines, but no penalty is shaken <lb/>
over their heads to scare them. The same <lb/>
command was issued to the members (num- <lb/>
bering to - day twenty - five thousand) of The <lb/>
Mother-Church, also, but with it went a <i>threat</i>, <lb/>
of the infliction, in case of disobedience, of <lb/>
the most dreaded punishment that has a place <lb/>
in the Church's list of penalties for trans- <lb/>
gressions of Mrs. Eddy's edicts&#x2014;excommuni- <lb/>
cation:</p>
<quotedLetter>
<p><i>"If a member of The First Church of Christ, <lb/>

<p>It is the spirit of the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
<p>None but accepted and well-established <i>gods</i> <lb/>
can venture an affront like that and do it with <lb/>
confidence. But the human race will take any- <lb/>
<pb n="255"/>
thing from that class. Mrs. Eddy knows the <lb/>
human race; knows it better than any mere <lb/>
human being has known it in a thousand cen- <lb/>
turies. My confidence in her human-beingship <lb/>
is getting shaken, my confidence in her godship <lb/>
is stiffening.</p>

<p>A Scientist out West has visited a book- <lb/>
seller&#x2014;with intent to find fault with me&#x2014;and <lb/>
has brought away the information that the <lb/>
price at which Mrs. Eddy sells <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i> is not an unusually high one for the size <lb/>
and make of the book. That is true. But in <lb/>
the book-trade&#x2014;that profit-devourer unknown <lb/>
to Mrs. Eddy's book&#x2014;a three-dollar book that <lb/>
is made for thirty-five or forty cents in large <lb/>
editions is put at three dollars because the pub- <lb/>
lisher has to pay author, middleman, and ad- <lb/>
vertising, and if the price were much below three <lb/>
the profit accruing would not pay him fairly <lb/>
for his time and labor. At the same time, if he <lb/>
could get ten dollars for the book he would take <lb/>
it, and his morals would not fall under criticism.</p>
<pb n="256"/>
<p>But if he were an inspired person commis- <lb/>
sioned by the Deity to receive and print and <lb/>
spread broadcast among sorrowing and suffer- <lb/>
ing and poor men a precious message of heal- <lb/>
ing and cheer and salvation, he would have to <lb/>
do as Bible Societies do&#x2014;sell the book at a <lb/>
pinched margin above cost to such as could <lb/>
pay, and give it free to all that couldn't; and <lb/>
his name would be praised. But if he sold it <lb/>
at seven hundred per cent. profit and put the <lb/>
money in his pocket, his name would be mocked <lb/>
and derided. Just as Mrs. Eddy's is. And most <lb/>
justifiably, as it seems to me.</p>
<p>The complete Bible contains one million <lb/>
words. The New Testament by itself contains <lb/>
two hundred and forty thousand words.</p>
<p>My '84 edition of <i>Science and Health</i> con- <lb/>
tains one hundred and twenty thousand <lb/>
words&#x2014;just half as many as the New Testa- <lb/>
ment.</p>
<p><i>Science and Health</i> has since been so inflated <lb/>
by later inspirations that the 1902 edition con- <lb/>
tains one hundred and eighty thousand words&#x2014; <lb/>
not counting the thirty thousand at the back, <lb/>
devoted by Mrs. Eddy to advertising the book's <lb/>
<pb n="257"/>
healing abilities&#x2014;and the inspiring continues <lb/>
right along.</p>
<p>If you have a book whose market is so sure <lb/>
and so great that you can give a printer an <lb/>
everlasting order for thirty or forty or fifty <lb/>
thousand copies a year he will furnish them at <lb/>
a cheap rate, because whenever there is a slack <lb/>
time in his press-room and bindery he can fill <lb/>
the idle intervals on your book and be making <lb/>
something instead of losing. That is the kind <lb/>
of contract that can be let on <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i> every year. I am obliged to doubt <lb/>
that the three-dollar <i>Science and Health</i> costs <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy above fifteen cents, or that the six- <lb/>
dollar copy costs her above eighty cents. I <lb/>
feel quite sure that the average profit to her on <lb/>
these books, above cost of manufacture, is all <lb/>
of seven hundred per cent.</p>
<p>Every proper Christian Scientist has to buy <lb/>
and own (and canvass for) <i>Science and Health</i> <lb/>
(one hundred and eighty thousand words), and <lb/>
he must also own a Bible (one million words). <lb/>
He can buy the one for from three to six dollars, <lb/>
and the other for fifteen cents. Or, if three <lb/>
dollars is all the money he has, he can get his <lb/>
<pb n="258"/>
Bible for <i>nothing</i>. When the Supreme Being <lb/>
disseminates a saving Message through unin- <lb/>
spired agents&#x2014;the New Testament, for instance <lb/>
&#x2014;it can be done for five cents a copy; but when <lb/>
He sends one containing only two-thirds as <lb/>
many words through the shop of a Divine Per- <lb/>
sonage, it costs <i>sixty times as much</i>. I think <lb/>
that in matters of such importance it is bad <lb/>
economy to employ a wild-cat agency.</p>
<p>Here are some figures which are perfect- <lb/>
ly authentic, and which seem to justify my <lb/>
opinion:</p>
<p>"These [Bible] societies, inspired only by a <lb/>
sense of religious duty, are issuing the Bible at <lb/>
a price so small that they have made it <i>the <lb/>
cheapest book printed</i>. For example, the Amer- <lb/>
ican Bible Society offers an edition of <i>the whole <lb/>
Bible as low as fifteen cents</i> and the <i>New Testa- <lb/>
ment at five cents</i>, and the British Society at <i>six- <lb/>
pence and one penny, respectively</i>. These low <lb/>
prices, made possible by their policy of selling <lb/>
the books <i>at cost or below cost</i>," etc.&#x2014;New York <lb/>

<p><smcap>There</smcap> she stands&#x2014;painted by herself. No <lb/>
witness but herself has been allowed to testify. <lb/>
She stands there painted by her <i>acts</i>, and deco- <lb/>
rated by her words. When she talks, she has <lb/>
only a decorative value as a witness, either for <lb/>
or against herself, for she deals mainly in unsup- <lb/>
ported assertion; and in the rare cases where <lb/>
she puts forward a verifiable fact she gets out <lb/>
of it a meaning which it refuses to furnish to <lb/>
anybody else. Also, when she talks, she is un- <lb/>
stable; she wanders, she is incurably inconsist- <lb/>
ent; what she says to-day she contradicts to- <lb/>
morrow.</p>
<p>But her <i>acts</i> are consistent. They are al- <lb/>
ways faithful to her, they never misinterpret <lb/>
her, they are a mirror which always reflects her <lb/>
exactly, precisely, minutely, unerringly, and <lb/>
always the same, to date, with only those pro- <lb/>
gressive little natural changes in stature, dress, <lb/>
complexion, mood, and carriage that mark&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="262"/>
exteriorly&#x2014;the march of the years and record <lb/>
the accumulations of experience, while&#x2014;in- <lb/>
teriorly&#x2014;through all this steady drift of evo- <lb/>
lution the one essential detail, the commanding <lb/>
detail, the master detail of the make-up re- <lb/>
mains as it was in the beginning, suffers no <lb/>
change and <i>can</i> suffer none; the <i>basis</i> of the <lb/>
character; the temperament, the disposition, <lb/>
that indestructible iron framework upon which <lb/>
the character is <i>built</i>, and whose shape it must <lb/>
take, and keep, throughout life. We call it a <lb/>
person's <i>nature</i>.</p>
<p>The man who is born stingy can be taught <lb/>
to give liberally&#x2014;with his hands; but not with <lb/>
his heart. The man born kind and compas- <lb/>
sionate can have that disposition crushed down <lb/>
out of sight by embittering experience; but if it <lb/>
were an organ the post-mortem would find it <lb/>
still in his corpse. The man born ambitious of <lb/>
power and glory may live long without finding <lb/>
it out, but when the opportunity comes he will <lb/>
know, will strike for the largest thing within <lb/>
the limit of his chances at the time&#x2014;constable, <lb/>
perhaps&#x2014;and will be glad and proud when he <lb/>
gets it, and will write home about it. But he <lb/>
<pb n="263"/>
will not stop with that start; his appetite will <lb/>
come again; and by-and-by again, and yet <lb/>
again; and when he has climbed to police com- <lb/>
missioner it will at last begin to dawn upon <lb/>
him that what his Napoleon soul wants and <lb/>
was born for is something away higher up&#x2014; <lb/>
he does not quite know what, but Circumstance <lb/>
and Opportunity will indicate the direction and <lb/>
he will cut a road through and find out.</p>
<p>I think Mrs. Eddy was born with a far-seeing <lb/>
business-eye, but did not know it; and with a <lb/>
great organizing and executive talent, and did <lb/>
not know it; and with a large appetite for <lb/>
power and distinction, and did not know it. I <lb/>
think the reason that her make did not show <lb/>
up until middle life was that she had General <lb/>
Grant's luck&#x2014;Circumstance and Opportunity <lb/>
did not come her way when she was younger. <lb/>
The qualities that were born in her had to wait <lb/>
for circumstance and opportunity&#x2014;but they <lb/>
were there: they were there to stay, whether <lb/>
they ever got a chance to fructify or not. If <lb/>
they had come early, they would have found <lb/>
her ready and competent. And they&#x2014;not she <lb/>
&#x2014;would have determined what they would set <lb/>
<pb n="264"/>
her at and what they would make of her. If <lb/>
they had elected to commission her as second- <lb/>
assistant cook in a bankrupt boarding-house, I <lb/>
know the rest of it&#x2014;I know what would have <lb/>
happened. She would have owned the board- <lb/>
ing-house within six months; she would have <lb/>
had the late proprietor on salary and hump- <lb/>
ing himself, as the worldly say: she would have <lb/>
had that boarding-house spewing money like a <lb/>
mint; she would have worked the servants and <lb/>
the late landlord up to the limit; she would have <lb/>
squeezed the boarders till they wailed, and by <lb/>
some mysterious quality born in her she would <lb/>
have kept the affections of certain of the lot <lb/>
whose love and esteem she valued, and flung <lb/>
the others down the back area; in two years she <lb/>
would own all the boarding-houses in the town <lb/>
in five all the boarding-houses in the State, in <lb/>
twenty all the hotels in America, in forty all the <lb/>
hotels on the planet, and would sit at home with <lb/>
her finger on a button and govern the whole <lb/>
combination as easily as a bench-manager gov- <lb/>
erns a dog-show.</p>
<p>It would be a grand thing to see, and I feel a <lb/>
kind of disappointment&#x2014;but never mind, a <lb/>
<pb n="265"/>
religion is better and larger; and there is more <lb/>
<i>to</i> it. And I have not been steeping myself in <lb/>
Christian Science all these weeks without find- <lb/>
ing out that the one sensible thing to do with a <lb/>
disappointment is to put it out of your mind <lb/>
and think of something cheerfuler.</p>
<p>We outsiders cannot conceive of Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
Christian Science Religion as being a sudden <lb/>
and miraculous birth, but only as a growth from <lb/>
a seed planted by circumstances, and developed <lb/>
stage by stage by command and compulsion of <lb/>
the same force. What the stages were we can- <lb/>
not know, but are privileged to guess. She <lb/>
may have gotten the mental-healing idea from <lb/>
Quimby&#x2014;it had been experimented with for <lb/>
ages, and was no one's special property. [For <lb/>
the present, for convenience' sake, let us pro- <lb/>
ceed upon the hypothesis that that was <i>all</i> she <lb/>
got of him, and that she put up the rest of the <lb/>
assets herself. This will strain us, but let us <lb/>
try it.] In each and all its forms and under all <lb/>
its many names, mental healing had had lim- <lb/>
its, always, and they were rather narrow ones&#x2014; <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy, let us imagine, removed the fence, <lb/>
abolished the frontiers. Not by expanding <lb/>
<pb n="266"/>
mental-healing, but by absorbing its small bulk <lb/>
into the vaster bulk of Christian Science&#x2014; <lb/>
Divine Science, The Holy Ghost, the Comforter <lb/>
&#x2014;which was a quite different and sublimer <lb/>
force, and one which had long lain dormant and <lb/>
unemployed.</p>
<p>The Christian Scientist believes that the <lb/>
Spirit of God (life and love) pervades the uni- <lb/>
verse like an atmosphere; that whoso will study <lb/>
<i>Science and Health</i> can get from it the secret of <lb/>
how to inhale that transforming air; that to <lb/>
breathe it is to be made new; that from the <lb/>
new man all sorrow, all care, all miseries of the <lb/>
mind vanish away, for that only peace, content- <lb/>
ment and measureless joy can live in that divine <lb/>
fluid; that it purifies the body from disease, <lb/>
which is a vicious creation of the gross human <lb/>
mind, and cannot continue to exist in the pres- <lb/>
ence of the Immortal Mind, the renewing Spirit <lb/>
of God.</p>
<p>The Scientist finds this reasonable, natural, <lb/>
and not harder to believe than that the disease- <lb/>
germ, a creature of darkness, perishes when ex- <lb/>
posed to the light of the great sun&#x2014;a new rev- <lb/>
elation of profane science which no one doubts. <lb/>
<pb n="267"/>
He reminds us that the actinic ray, shining <lb/>
upon lupus, cures it&#x2014;a horrible disease which <lb/>
was incurable fifteen years ago, and had been <lb/>
incurable for ten million years before; that this <lb/>
wonder, unbelievable by the physicians at first, <lb/>
is believed by them now; and so he is tranquilly <lb/>
confident that the time is coming when the <lb/>
world will be educated up to a point where it <lb/>
will comprehend and grant that the light of the <lb/>
Spirit of God, shining unobstructed upon the <lb/>
soul, is an actinic ray which can purge both <lb/>
mind and body from disease and set them free <lb/>
and make them whole.</p>
<p>It is apparent, then, that in Christian Science <lb/>
it is not one man's mind acting upon another <lb/>
man's mind that heals; that it is solely the <lb/>
Spirit of God that heals; that the healer's mind <lb/>
performs no office but to convey that force to <lb/>
the patient; that it is merely the wire which <lb/>
carries the electric fluid, so to speak, and de- <lb/>
livers the message. Therefore, if these things <lb/>
be true, mental-healing and Science-healing are <lb/>
separate and distinct processes, and no kinship <lb/>
exists between them.</p>
<p>To heal the body of its ills and pains is a <lb/>
<pb n="268"/>
mighty benefaction, but in our day our physi- <lb/>
cians and surgeons work a thousand miracles&#x2014; <lb/>
prodigies which would have ranked as miracles <lb/>
fifty years ago&#x2014;and they have so greatly ex- <lb/>
tended their domination over disease that we <lb/>
feel so well protected that we are able to look <lb/>
with a good deal of composure and absence of <lb/>
hysterics upon the claims of new competitors <lb/>
in that field.</p>
<p>But there is a mightier benefaction than the <lb/>
healing of the body, and that is the healing of <lb/>
the spirit&#x2014;which is Christian Science's other <lb/>
claim. So far as I know, so far as I can find <lb/>
out, it makes it good. Personally I have not <lb/>
known a Scientist who did not seem serene, <lb/>
contented, unharassed. I have not found an <lb/>
outsider whose observation of Scientists fur- <lb/>
nished him a view that differed from my own. <lb/>
Buoyant spirits, comfort of mind, freedom <lb/>
from care&#x2014;these happinesses we all have, at <lb/>
intervals; but in the spaces between, dear me, <lb/>
the black hours! They have put a curse upon <lb/>
the life of every human being I have ever known, <lb/>
young or old. I concede not a single excep- <lb/>
tion. Unless it might be those Scientists just <lb/>
<pb n="269"/>
referred to. They may have been playing a <lb/>
part with me; I hope they were not, and I be- <lb/>
lieve they were not.</p>
<p>Time will test the Science's claim. If time <lb/>
shall make it good; if time shall prove that the <lb/>
Science can heal the persecuted spirit of man <lb/>
and banish its troubles and keep it serene and <lb/>
sunny and content&#x2014;why, then Mrs. Eddy will <lb/>
have a monument that will reach above the <lb/>
clouds. For if she did not hit upon that im- <lb/>
perial idea and evolve it and deliver it, its dis- <lb/>
coverer can never be identified with certainty, <lb/>
now, I think. It is the giant feature, it is the <lb/>
sun that rides in the zenith of Christian Science, <lb/>
the auxiliary features are of minor consequence <lb/>
[Let us still leave the large "if" aside, for the <lb/>
present, and proceed as if it had no existence.]</p>
<p>It is not supposable that Mrs. Eddy realized, <lb/>
at first, the size of her plunder. (No, <i>find</i>&#x2014; <lb/>
that is the word; she did not realize the size of <lb/>
her find, at first.) It had to grow upon her, by <lb/>
degrees, in accordance with the inalterable cus- <lb/>
tom of Circumstance, which works by stages, and <lb/>
by stages only, and never furnishes any mind <lb/>
with all the materials for a large idea at one time.</p>
<pb n="270"/>
<p>In the beginning, Mrs. Eddy was probably <lb/>
interested merely in the mental-healing detail. <lb/>
And perhaps mainly interested in it pecuniarily, <lb/>
for she was poor.</p>
<p>She would succeed in anything she under- <lb/>
took. She would attract pupils, and her com- <lb/>
merce would grow. She would inspire in pa- <lb/>
tient and pupil confidence in her earnestness; <lb/>
her history is evidence that she would not fail <lb/>
of that.</p>
<p>There probably came a time, in due course, <lb/>
when her students began to think there was <lb/>
something deeper in her teachings than they had <lb/>
been suspecting&#x2014;a mystery beyond mental- <lb/>
healing, and higher. It is conceivable that by <lb/>
consequence their manner towards her changed <lb/>
little by little, and from respectful became rev- <lb/>
erent. It is conceivable that this would have <lb/>
an influence upon her; that it would incline <lb/>
her to wonder if their secret thought&#x2014;that she <lb/>
was inspired&#x2014;might not be a well-grounded <lb/>
guess. It is conceivable that as time went on <lb/>
the thought in their minds and its reflection <lb/>
in hers might solidify into conviction.</p>
<p>She would remember, then, that as a child <lb/>
<pb n="271"/>
she had been called, more than once, by a mys- <lb/>
terious voice&#x2014;just as had happened to little <lb/>
Samuel. (Mentioned in her <i>Autobiography</i>.) <lb/>
She would be impressed by that ancient remi- <lb/>
niscence, now, and it could have a prophetic <lb/>
meaning for her.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the persuasive influ- <lb/>
ences around her and within her would give a <lb/>
new and powerful impulse to her philosophiz- <lb/>
ings, and that from this, in time, would result <lb/>
that great birth, the healing of body and mind <lb/>
by the inpouring of the Spirit of God&#x2014;the cen- <lb/>
tral and dominant idea of Christian Science&#x2014; <lb/>
and that when this idea came she would not <lb/>
doubt that it was an inspiration direct from <lb/>
Heaven.</p>

<p>[<smcap>I must</smcap> rest a little, now. To sit here and <lb/>

Mrs. Eddy, of all people, working her mind on <lb/>
a plane above commercialism; imagines her <lb/>

with it.]</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="XII">
<pb/>
<head><b><smcap>chapter xii</smcap></b></head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> is evident that she made disciples fast, and <lb/>
that their belief in her and in the authenticity <lb/>
of her heavenly ambassadorship was not of the <lb/>
lukewarm and half - way sort, but was pro- <lb/>
foundly earnest and sincere. Her book was is- <lb/>
sued from the press in 1875, it began its work <lb/>
of convert-making, and within six years she had <lb/>
successfully launched a new Religion and a new <lb/>
system of healing, and was teaching them to <lb/>
crowds of eager students in a College of her <lb/>
own, at prices so extraordinary that we are al- <lb/>
most compelled to accept her statement (no, <lb/>
her guarded intimation) that the rates were ar- <lb/>
ranged on high, since a mere human being un- <lb/>
acquainted with commerce and accustomed to <lb/>
think in pennies could hardly put up such a <lb/>
hand as that without supernatural help.</p>
<p>From this stage onward&#x2014;Mrs. Eddy being <lb/>
what she was&#x2014;the rest of the development- <lb/>
stages would follow naturally and inevitably. <lb/>
<pb n="274"/>
But if she had been anybody else, there would <lb/>
have been a different arrangement of them, <lb/>
with different results. Being the extraordi- <lb/>
nary person she was, she realized her position <lb/>
and its possibilities; realized the possibilities, <lb/>
and had the daring to use them for all they <lb/>
were worth.</p>
<p>We have seen what her methods were after <lb/>
she passed the stage where her divine ambassa- <lb/>
dorship was granted its exequatur in the hearts <lb/>
and minds of her followers; we have seen how <lb/>
steady and fearless and calculated and orderly <lb/>
was her march thenceforth from conquest to <lb/>
conquest; we have seen her strike dead, without <lb/>
hesitancy, any hostile or questionable force that <lb/>
rose in her path: first, the horde of pretenders <lb/>
that sprang up and tried to take her Science <lb/>
and its market away from her&#x2014;she crushed <lb/>
them, she obliterated them: when her own Na- <lb/>
tional Christian Science Association became <lb/>
great in numbers and influence, and loosely and <lb/>
dangerously garrulous, and began to expound <lb/>
the doctrines according to its own uninspired <lb/>
notions, she took up her sponge without a tre- <lb/>
mor of fear and wiped that Association out; <lb/>
<pb n="275"/>
when she perceived that the preachers in her <lb/>
pulpits were becoming afflicted with doctrine- <lb/>
tinkering, she recognized the danger of it, and <lb/>
did not hesitate nor temporize, but promptly <lb/>
dismissed the whole of them in a day, and abol- <lb/>
ished their office permanently; we have seen <lb/>
that, as fast as her power grew, she was compe- <lb/>
tent to take the measure of it, and that as fast <lb/>
as its expansion suggested to her gradually <lb/>
awakening native ambition a higher step she <lb/>
took it; and so, by this evolutionary process, <lb/>
we have seen the gross money-lust relegated <lb/>
to second place, and the lust of empire and <lb/>
glory rise above it. A splendid dream; and <lb/>
by force of the qualities born in her she is <lb/>
making it come true.</p>
<p>These qualities&#x2014;and the capacities growing <lb/>
out of them by the nurturing influences of <lb/>
training, observation, and experience&#x2014;seem <lb/>
to be clearly indicated by the character of her <lb/>
career and its achievements. They seem to <lb/>
be:</p>
<list>
<item>A clear head for business, and a phenom- <lb/>
enally long one;</item>
<item>Clear understanding of business situations;</item>
<pb n="276"/>
<item>Accuracy in estimating the opportunities they <lb/>
offer;</item>
<item>Intelligence in planning a business move;</item>
<item>Firmness in sticking to it after it has been <lb/>
decided upon;</item>
<item>Extraordinary daring;</item>
<item>Indestructible persistency;</item>
<item>Devouring ambition;</item>
<item>Limitless selfishness;</item>
</list>
<p>A knowledge of the weaknesses and poverties <lb/>
and docilities of human nature and how to turn <lb/>
them to account which has never been sur- <lb/>
passed, if ever equalled;</p>
<p>And&#x2014;necessarily&#x2014;the foundation-stone of <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy's character is a never - wavering <lb/>
confidence in herself.</p>
<p>It is a granite character. And&#x2014;quite nat- <lb/>
urally&#x2014;a measure of the talc of smallnesses <lb/>
common to human nature is mixed up in it <lb/>
and distributed through it. When Mrs. Eddy is <lb/>
not dictating servilities from her throne in the <lb/>
clouds to her official domestics in Boston or to <lb/>
her far-spread subjects round about the planet, <lb/>
but is down on the ground, she is kin to us and <lb/>
one of us: sentimental as a girl, garrulous, un- <lb/>
<pb n="277"/>
grammatical, incomprehensible, affected, vain <lb/>
of her little human ancestry, unstable, incon- <lb/>
sistent, unreliable in statement, and na&#x00EF;vely <lb/>
and everlastingly self-contradictory&#x2014;oh, triv- <lb/>
ial and common and commonplace as the com- <lb/>
monest of <unclear>us</unclear> just a Napoleon as Madame de <lb/>
R&#x00E9;musat saw him, a brass god with clay legs.</p>

<p><smcap>In</smcap> drawing Mrs. Eddy's portrait it has been <lb/>
my purpose to restrict myself to materials fur- <lb/>
nished by <i>herself</i>, and I believe I have done that. <lb/>
If I have misinterpreted any of her acts, it was <lb/>
not done intentionally.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that in skeletonizing a list <lb/>
of the qualities which have carried her to the <lb/>
dizzy summit which she occupies, I have not <lb/>
mentioned the power which was the command- <lb/>
ing force employed in achieving that lofty flight. <lb/>
It did not belong in that list; it was a force that <lb/>
was not a detail of her character, but was an <lb/>
outside one. It was the power which proceed- <lb/>
ed from her people's recognition of her as a su- <lb/>
pernatural personage, conveyer of the Latest <lb/>
Word, and divinely commissioned to deliver it <lb/>
to the world. The form which such a recog- <lb/>
nition takes, consciously or unconsciously, is <lb/>
<i>worship;</i> and worship does not question nor <lb/>
criticise, it obeys. The object of it does not <lb/>
<pb n="279"/>
need to coddle it, bribe it, beguile it, reason with <lb/>
it, convince it&#x2014;it commands it; that is suffi- <lb/>
cient; the obedience rendered is not reluctant, <lb/>
but prompt and whole-hearted. Admiration <lb/>
for a Napoleon, confidence in him, pride in him, <lb/>
affection for him, can lift him high and carry <lb/>
him far; and these are forms of worship, and are <lb/>
strong forces, but they are worship of a mere <lb/>
human being, after all, and are infinitely feeble, <lb/>
as compared with those that are generated by <lb/>
that other worship, the worship of a divine <lb/>
personage. Mrs. Eddy has this efficient wor- <lb/>
ship, this massed and centralized force, this <lb/>
force which is indifferent to opposition, un- <lb/>
troubled by fear, and goes to battle singing, <lb/>
like Cromwell's soldiers; and while she has it <lb/>
she can command and it will obey, and main- <lb/>
tain her on her throne, and extend her empire.</p>
<p>She will have it until she dies; and then we <lb/>
shall see a curious and interesting further de- <lb/>
velopment of her revolutionary work begin.</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> President and Board of Directors will <lb/>
succeed her, and the government will go on with- <lb/>
out a hitch. The By-laws will bear that inter- <lb/>
pretation. All the Mother-Church's vast powers <lb/>
are concentrated in that Board. Mrs. Eddy's un- <lb/>
limited personal reservations make the Board's <lb/>
ostensible supremacy, during her life, a sham, <lb/>
and the Board itself a shadow. But Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
has not made those reservations for any one <lb/>
but herself&#x2014;they are distinctly personal, they <lb/>
bear her name, they are not usable by another <lb/>
individual. When she dies her reservations die, <lb/>
and the Board's shadow-powers become real <lb/>
powers, without the change of any important <lb/>
By - law, and the Board sits in her place as <lb/>
absolute and irresponsible a sovereign as she <lb/>
was.</p>
<p>It consists of but five persons, a much more <lb/>
manageable Cardinalate than the Roman <lb/>
<pb n="281"/>
Pope's. I think it will elect its Pope from its <lb/>
own body, and that it will fill its own vacan- <lb/>

<p><smcap>We</smcap> may take that up now.</p>
<p>It is not a single if, but a several-jointed one; <lb/>
not an oyster, but a vertebrate.</p>
<list>
<item>1. Did Mrs. Eddy borrow from Quimby the <lb/>
Great Idea, or only the little one, the old-timer, <lb/>
the ordinary mental-healing&#x2014;healing by "mor- <lb/>
tal" mind?</item>
<item>2. If she borrowed the Great Idea, did she <lb/>
carry it away in her head, or in manuscript?</item>
<item>3. Did she hit upon the Great Idea herself?</item>
<item>By the Great Idea I mean, of course, the con- <lb/>
viction that the Force involved was still exist- <lb/>
ent, and could be applied now just as it was <lb/>
applied by Christ's Disciples and their con- <lb/>
verts, and as successfully.</item>
<item>4. Did she philosophize it, systematize it, <lb/>
and write it down in a book?</item>
<item>5. Was it she, and not another, that built a <lb/>
new Religion upon the book and organized it?</item>
</list>
<p>I think No. 5 can be answered with a Yes, <lb/>
<pb n="283"/>
and dismissed from the controversy. And I <lb/>
think that the Great Idea, great as it was, <lb/>
would have enjoyed but a brief activity, and <lb/>
would then have gone to sleep again for some <lb/>
more centuries, but for the perpetuating im- <lb/>
pulse it got from that organized and tremen- <lb/>
dous force.</p>
<p>As for Nos. 1, 2, and 4, the hostiles contend <lb/>
that Mrs. Eddy got the Great Idea from Quim- <lb/>
by and carried it off in manuscript. But their <lb/>
testimony, while of consequence, lacks the most <lb/>
important detail; so far as my information goes, <lb/>
the Quimby manuscript has not been produced. <lb/>
I think we cannot discuss No. 1 and No. 2 prof- <lb/>
itably. Let them go.</p>
<p>For me, No. 3 has a mild interest, and No. 4 <lb/>
a violent one.</p>
<p>As regards No. 3, Mrs. Eddy was brought up, <lb/>
from the cradle, an old-time, boiler-iron, West- <lb/>
minster - Catechism Christian, and knew her <lb/>
Bible as well as Captain Kydd knew his, "when <lb/>
he sailed, when he sailed," and perhaps as <lb/>
sympathetically. The Great Idea had struck a <lb/>
million Bible-readers before her as being pos- <lb/>
sible of resurrection and application&#x2014;it must <lb/>
<pb n="284"/>
have struck as many as that, and been cogi- <lb/>
tated, indolently, doubtingly, then dropped and <lb/>
forgotten&#x2014;and it could have struck <i>her</i>, in due <lb/>
course. But how it could <i>interest</i> her, how it <lb/>
could appeal to her&#x2014;with her make&#x2014;is a <lb/>
thing that is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>For the thing back of it is wholly gracious and <lb/>
beautiful: the power, through loving merciful- <lb/>
ness and compassion, to heal fleshly ills and <lb/>
pains and griefs&#x2014;<i>all</i>&#x2014;with a word, with a <lb/>
touch of the hand! This power was given by <lb/>
the Saviour to the Disciples, and to <i>all</i> the con- <lb/>
verted. All&#x2014;every one. It was <i>exercised</i> for <lb/>
generations afterwards. Any Christian who <lb/>
was in earnest and not a make-believe, not a <lb/>
policy-Christian, not a Christian for revenue <lb/>
only, had that healing power, and could cure <lb/>
with it <i>any disease or any hurt or damage possi- <lb/>
ble to human flesh and bone</i>. These things are <lb/>
true, or they are not. If they were true sev- <lb/>
enteen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago <lb/>
it would be difficult to satisfactorily explain why <lb/>
or how or by what argument that power should <lb/>
be non-existent in Christians now.<ref target="n36"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n36" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>See Appendix.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note></p>
<pb n="285"/>
<p>To wish to exercise it could occur to Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy&#x2014;but would it?</p>
<p>Grasping, sordid, penurious, famishing for <lb/>
everything she sees&#x2014;money, power, glory&#x2014; <lb/>
vain, untruthful, jealous, despotic, arrogant, <lb/>
insolent, pitiless where thinkers and hypnotists <lb/>
are concerned, illiterate, shallow, incapable of <lb/>
reasoning outside of commercial lines, immeas- <lb/>
urably selfish&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of course the Great Idea <i>could</i> strike her, we <lb/>
have to grant that, but why it should <i>interest</i> <lb/>
her is a question which can easily overstrain <lb/>
the imagination and bring on nervous prostra- <lb/>
tion, or something like that, and is better left <lb/>
alone by the judicious, it seems to me&#x2014;</p>
<p>Unless we call to our help the alleged other <lb/>
side of Mrs. Eddy's make and character&#x2014;the <lb/>
side which her multitude of followers see, and <lb/>
sincerely believe in. Fairness requires that <lb/>
their view be stated here. It is the opposite of <lb/>
the one which I have drawn from Mrs. Eddy's <lb/>
history and from her By-laws. To her fol- <lb/>
lowers she is this:</p>
<p>Patient, gentle, loving, compassionate, noble- <lb/>
hearted, unselfish, sinless, widely cultured, <lb/>
<pb n="286"/>
splendidly equipped mentally, a profound <lb/>
thinker, an able writer, a divine personage, an <lb/>
inspired messenger whose acts are dictated <lb/>
from the Throne, and whose every utterance is <lb/>
the Voice of God.</p>
<p>She has delivered to them a religion which has <lb/>
revolutionized their lives, banished the glooms <lb/>
that shadowed them, and filled them and flooded <lb/>
them with sunshine and gladness and peace; a <lb/>
religion which has no hell; a religion whose <lb/>
heaven is not put off to another time, with a <lb/>
break and a gulf between, but begins here and <lb/>
now, and melts into eternity as fancies of the <lb/>
waking day melt into the dreams of sleep.</p>
<p>They believe it is a Christianity that is in the <lb/>
New Testament; that it has always been there; <lb/>
that in the drift of ages it was lost through dis- <lb/>
use and neglect, and that this benefactor has <lb/>
found it and given it back to men, turning the <lb/>
night of life into day, its terrors into myths, its <lb/>
lamentations into songs of emancipation and <lb/>
rejoicing.<ref target="n37"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n37" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>For a clear understanding of the two claims of Chris- <lb/>
tian Science, read the novel <i>The Life Within</i>, published by <lb/>

<pb n="287"/>
<p>There we have Mrs. Eddy as her followers <lb/>
see her. She has lifted them out of grief and <lb/>
care and doubt and fear, and made their lives <lb/>
beautiful; she found them wandering forlorn in <lb/>
a wintry wilderness, and has led them to a trop- <lb/>
ic paradise like that of which the poet sings: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"O, islands there are on the face of the deep</l>
<l>Where the leaves never fade and the skies never <lb/>
weep."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>To ask them to examine with a microscope <lb/>
the character of such a benefactor; to ask them <lb/>
to examine it at all; to ask them to look at a <lb/>
blemish which another person believes he has <lb/>
found in it&#x2014;well, in their place could you do <lb/>
it? Would you do it? Wouldn't you be <lb/>
ashamed to do it? If a tramp had rescued <lb/>
your child from fire and death, and saved its <lb/>
mother's heart from breaking, could you see <lb/>
his rags? Could you smell his breath? Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy has done more than that for these people.</p>
<p>They are prejudiced witnesses. To the credit <lb/>
of human nature it is not possible that they <lb/>
should be otherwise. They sincerely believe <lb/>
that Mrs. Eddy's character is pure and perfect <lb/>
<pb n="288"/>
and beautiful, and her history without stain or <lb/>
blot or blemish. But that does not settle it. <lb/>
They sincerely believe she did not borrow the <lb/>
Great Idea from Quimby, but hit upon it her- <lb/>
self. It may be so, and it could be so. Let it <lb/>
go&#x2014;there is no way to settle it. They believe <lb/>
she carried away no Quimby manuscripts. Let <lb/>
that go, too&#x2014;there is no way to settle it. They <lb/>
believe that she, and not another, built the Re- <lb/>
ligion upon the book, and organized it. I be- <lb/>
lieve it, too.</p>
<p>Finally, they believe that she philosophized <lb/>
Christian Science, explained it, systematized it, <lb/>
and wrote it all out with her own hand in the <lb/>
book <i>Science and Health</i>.</p>
<p>I am not able to believe that. Let us draw <lb/>
the line there. The known and undisputed <lb/>
products of her pen are a formidable witness <lb/>
against her. They do seem to me to prove, <lb/>
quite clearly and conclusively, that writing, <lb/>
upon even simple subjects, is a difficult labor <lb/>
for her; that she has never been able to write <lb/>
anything above third-rate English; that she is <lb/>
weak in the matter of grammar; that she has <lb/>
but a rude and dull sense of the values of <lb/>
<pb n="289"/>
words; that she so lacks in the matter of liter <lb/>
ary precision that she can seldom put a thought <lb/>
into words that express it lucidly to the reader <lb/>
and leave no doubts in his mind as to whether <lb/>
he has rightly understood or not; that she can- <lb/>
not even draught a Preface that a person can <lb/>
fully comprehend, nor one which can by any art <lb/>
be translated <i>into</i> a fully understandable form; <lb/>
that she can seldom inject into a Preface even <lb/>
single sentences whose meaning is uncompro- <lb/>
misingly clear&#x2014;yet Prefaces are her specialty, <lb/>
if she has one.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy's known and undisputed writings <lb/>
are very limited in bulk; they exhibit no depth, <lb/>
no analytical quality, no thought above school- <lb/>
composition size, and but juvenile ability in <lb/>
handling thoughts of even that modest magni- <lb/>
tude. She has a fine commercial ability, and <lb/>
could govern a vast railway system in great <lb/>
style; she could draught a set of rules that Satan <lb/>
himself would say could not be improved on&#x2014; <lb/>
for devilish effectiveness&#x2014;by his staff; but we <lb/>
know, by our excursions among the Mother- <lb/>
Church's By - laws, that their English would <lb/>
discredit the deputy baggage-smasher. I am <lb/>
<pb n="290"/>
quite sure that Mrs. Eddy cannot write well <lb/>
upon any subject, even a commercial one.</p>
<p>In the very first revision of <i>Science and <lb/>
Health</i> (1883), Mrs. Eddy wrote a Preface which <lb/>
is an unimpeachable witness that the rest of <lb/>
the book was written by somebody else. I <lb/>
have put it in the Appendix<ref target="n38"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n38" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>See Appendix A.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> along with a page <lb/>

will ask the reader to compare the labored and <lb/>
lumbering and confused gropings of this Preface <lb/>
with the easy and flowing and direct English of <lb/>
the other exhibit, and see if he can believe that <lb/>

a dozen sentences whose meanings he is so sure <lb/>
of that he can rephrase them&#x2014;in words of his <lb/>

(last year's edition of <i>Science and Health</i>), and <lb/>
compare that wise and sane and elevated and <lb/>
lucid and compact piece of work with the afore- <lb/>
said Preface, and with Mrs. Eddy's poetry con- <lb/>
cerning the gymnastic trees, and Minerva's not <lb/>

from Erudition's bower for the decoration of <lb/>
Plymouth Rock, and the Plague-spot and Ba- <lb/>

affirmation, or anybody's sworn testimony, or <lb/>
any other testimony of any imaginable kind, <lb/>
would ever be likely to convince him that Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy wrote that chapter on Prayer.</p>
<p>I do not wish to impose my opinion on any <lb/>
one who will not permit it, but such as it is I <lb/>
offer it here for what it is worth. I cannot <lb/>
believe, and I do not believe, that Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
originated any of the thoughts and reasonings <lb/>
out of which the book <i>Science and Health</i> is con- <lb/>
<pb n="292"/>
structed; and I cannot believe, and do not be- <lb/>
lieve that she ever wrote any part of that book.</p>
<p>I think that if anything in the world stands <lb/>
proven, and well and solidly proven, by unim- <lb/>
peachable testimony&#x2014;the treacherous testi- <lb/>
mony of her own pen in her known and undis- <lb/>
puted literary productions&#x2014;it is that Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy is not capable of thinking upon high <lb/>
planes, nor of reasoning clearly nor writing in- <lb/>
telligently upon low ones.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as&#x2014;in my belief&#x2014;the very first <lb/>
editions of the book <i>Science and Health</i> were <lb/>
far above the reach of Mrs. Eddy's mental and <lb/>
literary abilities, I think she has from the very <lb/>
beginning been claiming as her own another <lb/>
person's book, and wearing as her own property <lb/>
laurels rightfully belonging to that person&#x2014; <lb/>
the <i>real</i> author of <i>Science and Health</i>. And I <lb/>
think the reason&#x2014;and the only reason&#x2014;that <lb/>
he has not protested is because his work was <lb/>
not exposed to print until after he was safely <lb/>
dead.</p>
<p>That with an eye to business, and by grace of <lb/>
her business talent, she has restored to the <lb/>
world neglected and abandoned features of the <lb/>
<pb n="293"/>
Christian religion which her thousands of fol- <lb/>
lowers find gracious and blessed and contenting, <lb/>
I recognize and confess; but I am convinced <lb/>
that every single detail of the work except <lb/>
just that one&#x2014;the delivery of the product to <lb/>
the world&#x2014;was conceived and performed by <lb/>
another.</p>

<head><b>APPENDIX A</b></head>
<div2 type="chapter">
<head><smcap>original first preface to <i>science and health</i></smcap></head>
<p><smcap>There</smcap> seems a Christian necessity of learn- <lb/>
ing God's power and purpose to heal both mind <lb/>
and body. This thought grew out of our early <lb/>
seeking Him in all our ways, and a hopeless as <lb/>
singular invalidism that drugs increased instead <lb/>
of diminished, and hygiene benefited only for a <lb/>
season. By degrees we have drifted into more <lb/>
spiritual latitudes of thought, and experimented <lb/>
as we advanced until demonstrating fully the <lb/>
power of mind over the body. About the year <lb/>
1862, having heard of a mesmerist in Portland <lb/>
who was treating the sick by manipulation, we <lb/>
visited him; he helped us for a time, then we <lb/>
relapsed somewhat. After his decease, and a <lb/>
severe casualty deemed fatal by skilful physi- <lb/>
cians, we discovered that the Principle of all <lb/>
healing and the law that governs it is God, a <lb/>
divine Principle, and a spiritual not material <lb/>
law, and regained health.</p>
<pb n="295"/>
<p>It was not an individual or mortal mind act- <lb/>
ing upon another so-called mind that healed <lb/>
us. It was the glorious truths of Christian <lb/>
Science that we discovered as we neared that <lb/>
verge of so-called material life named death; <lb/>
yea, it was the great Shekinah, the spirit of <lb/>
Life, Truth, and Love illuminating our under- <lb/>
standing of the action and might of Omnipo- <lb/>
tence! The old gentleman to whom we have <lb/>
referred had some very advanced views on heal- <lb/>
ing, but he was not avowedly religious neither <lb/>
scholarly. We interchanged thoughts on the <lb/>
subject of healing the sick. I restored some <lb/>
patients of his that he failed to heal, and left <lb/>
in his possession some manuscripts of mine <lb/>
containing corrections of his desultory pen- <lb/>
nings, which I am informed at his decease <lb/>
passed into the hands of a patient of his, now <lb/>
residing in Scotland. He died in 1865 and <lb/>
left no published works. The only manuscript <lb/>
that we ever held of his, longer than to cor- <lb/>
rect it, was one of perhaps a dozen pages, <lb/>
most of which we had composed. He manip- <lb/>
ulated the sick; hence his ostensible method <lb/>
of healing was physical instead of <i>mental</i>. <lb/>
<pb n="296"/>
We helped him in the esteem of the public by <lb/>
our writings, but never knew of his stating orally <lb/>
or in writing that he treated his patients <i>men- <lb/>
tally;</i> never heard him give any directions to <lb/>
that effect; and have it from one of his patients, <lb/>
who now asserts that he was the founder of men- <lb/>
tal healing, that he never revealed to anyone <lb/>
his method. We refer to these facts simply to <lb/>
refute the calumnies and false claims of our en- <lb/>
emies, that we are preferring dishonest claims <lb/>
to the discovery and founding at this period of <lb/>
Metaphysical Healing or Christian Science.</p>
<p>The Science and laws of a purely mental heal- <lb/>
ing and their method of application through <lb/>
spiritual power alone, else a mental argument <lb/>
against disease, are our own discovery at this <lb/>
date. True, the Principle is divine and eternal; <lb/>
but the application of it to heal the sick had <lb/>
been lost sight of, and required to be again <lb/>
spiritually discerned and its science discovered, <lb/>
that man might retain it through the under- <lb/>
standing. Since our discovery in 1866 of the <lb/>
divine science of Christian Healing, we have <lb/>
labored with tongue and pen to found this sys- <lb/>
tem. In this endeavor every obstacle has been <lb/>
<pb n="297"/>
thrown in our path that the envy and revenge <lb/>
of a few disaffected students could devise. The <lb/>
superstition and ignorance of even this period <lb/>
have not failed to contribute their mite tow- <lb/>
ards misjudging us, while its Christian advance- <lb/>
ment and scientific research have helped sus- <lb/>
tain our feeble efforts.</p>
<p>Since our first Edition of <i>Science and Health</i>, <lb/>
published in 1875, two of the aforesaid students <lb/>
have plagiarized and pirated our works. In the <lb/>
issues of E. J. A., almost exclusively ours, were <lb/>
thirteen paragraphs, without credit, taken ver- <lb/>
batim from our books.</p>
<p>Not one of our printed works was ever cop- <lb/>
ied or abstracted from the published or from <lb/>
the unpublished writings of anyone. Through- <lb/>
out our publications of Metaphysical Healing <lb/>
or Christian Science, when writing or dictating <lb/>
them, we have given ourselves to contempla- <lb/>
tion wholly apart from the observation of the <lb/>
material senses: to look upon a copy would have <lb/>
distracted our thoughts from the subject before <lb/>
us. We were seldom able to copy our own com- <lb/>
positions, and have employed an amanuensis <lb/>
for the last six years. Every work that we <lb/>
<pb n="298"/>
have had published has been extemporaneously <lb/>
written; and out of fifty lectures and sermons <lb/>
that we have delivered the last year, forty-four <lb/>
have been extemporaneous. We have distrib- <lb/>
uted many of our unpublished manuscripts; <lb/>
loaned to one of our youngest students, R. <lb/>
K &#x2026;.. y, between three and four hundred <lb/>
pages, of which we were sole author&#x2014;giving <lb/>
him liberty to copy but not to publish them.</p>
<p>Leaning on the sustaining Infinite with lov- <lb/>
ing trust, the trials of to-day grow brief, and <lb/>
to-morrow is big with blessings.</p>
<p>The wakeful shepherd, tending his flocks, <lb/>
beholds from the mountain's top the first faint <lb/>
morning beam ere cometh the risen day. So <lb/>
from Soul's loftier summits shines the pale star <lb/>
to prophet-shepherd, and it traverses night, <lb/>
over to where the young child lies, in cradled <lb/>
obscurity, that shall waken a world. Over the <lb/>
night of error dawn the morning beams and <lb/>
guiding star of Truth, and "the wise men" are <lb/>
led by it to Science, which repeats the eternal <lb/>
harmony that it reproduced, in proof of im- <lb/>
mortality. The time for thinkers has come; <lb/>
and the time for revolutions, ecclesiastical and <lb/>
<pb n="299"/>
civil, must come. Truth, independent of doc- <lb/>
trines or time-honored systems, stands at the <lb/>
threshold of history. Contentment with the <lb/>
past, or the cold conventionality of custom, <lb/>
may no longer shut the door on science; though <lb/>
empires fall, "He whose right it is shall reign." <lb/>
Ignorance of God should no longer be the <lb/>
stepping-stone to faith; understanding Him, <lb/>
"whom to know aright is Life eternal," is the <lb/>
only guaranty of obedience.</p>
<p>This volume may not open a new thought, <lb/>
and make it at once familiar. It has the sturdy <lb/>
task of a pioneer, to hack away at the tall oaks <lb/>
and cut the rough granite, leaving future ages <lb/>
to declare what it has done. We made our <lb/>
first discovery of the adaptation of metaphys- <lb/>
ics to the treatment of disease in the winter of <lb/>
1866; since then we have tested the Principle <lb/>
on ourselves and others, and never found it to <lb/>
fail to prove the statements herein made of it. <lb/>
We must learn the science of Life, to reach the <lb/>
perfection of man. To understand God as the <lb/>
Principle of all being, and to live in accordance <lb/>
with this Principle, is the Science of Life. But <lb/>
to reproduce this harmony of being, the error <lb/>
<pb n="300"/>
of personal sense must yield to science, even as <lb/>
the science of music corrects tones caught from <lb/>
the ear, and gives the sweet concord of sound. <lb/>
There are many theories of physic and theology, <lb/>
and many calls in each of their directions for <lb/>
the right way; but we propose to settle the <lb/>
question of "What is Truth?" on the ground of <lb/>
proof, and let that method of healing the sick <lb/>
and establishing Christianity be adopted that <lb/>
is found to give the most health and to make <lb/>
the best Christians; science will then have a <lb/>
fair field, in which case we are assured of its tri- <lb/>
umph over all opinions and beliefs. Sickness <lb/>
and sin have ever had their doctors; but the <lb/>
question is, Have they become less because of <lb/>
them? The longevity of our antediluvians <lb/>
would say, No! and the criminal records of to- <lb/>
day utter their voices little in favor of such a <lb/>
conclusion. Not that we would deny to C&#x00E6;sar <lb/>
the things that are his, but that we ask for the <lb/>
things that belong to Truth; and safely affirm, <lb/>
from the demonstrations we have been able to <lb/>
make, that the science of man understood <lb/>
would have eradicated sin, sickness, and death, <lb/>
in a less period than six thousand years. We <lb/>
<pb n="301"/>
find great difficulties in starting this work right. <lb/>
Some shockingly false claims are already made <lb/>
to a metaphysical practice; mesmerism, its very <lb/>
antipodes, is one of them. Hitherto we have <lb/>
never, in a single instance of our discovery, <lb/>
found the slightest resemblance between mes- <lb/>
merism and metaphysics. No especial idiosyn- <lb/>
crasy is requisite to acquire a knowledge of <lb/>
metaphysical healing; spiritual sense is more <lb/>
important to its discernment than the intellect; <lb/>
and those who would learn this science without <lb/>
a high moral standard of thought and action, <lb/>
will fail to understand it until they go up higher. <lb/>
Owing to our explanations constantly vibrat- <lb/>
ing between the same points, an irksome repe- <lb/>
tition of words must occur; also the use of cap- <lb/>
ital letters, genders, and technicalities peculiar <lb/>
to the science. Variety of language, or beauty <lb/>
of diction, must give place to close analysis and <lb/>
unembellished thought. "Hoping all things, <lb/>
enduring all things," to do good to our enemies, <lb/>
to bless them that curse us, and to bear to the <lb/>
sorrowing and the sick consolation and healing, <lb/>
we commit these pages to posterity.</p>

<head><b>APPENDIX B</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> Gospel narratives bear brief testimony <lb/>
even to the life of our great Master. His spir- <lb/>
itual noumenon and phenomenon, silenced por- <lb/>
traiture. Writers, less wise than the Apostles, <lb/>
essayed in the Apocryphal New Testament, a <lb/>
legendary and traditional history of the early <lb/>
life of Jesus. But Saint Paul summarized the <lb/>
character of Jesus as the model of Christianity, <lb/>
in these words: "Consider Him who endured <lb/>
such contradictions of sinners against Himself. <lb/>
Who for the joy that was set before Him, en- <lb/>
dured the cross, despising the shame, and is <lb/>
set down at the right hand of the throne of <lb/>
God."</p>
<p>It may be that the mortal life battle still <lb/>
wages, and must continue till its involved <lb/>
errors are vanquished by victory - bringing <lb/>
Science; but this triumph will come! God is <lb/>
over all. He alone is our origin, aim, and Be- <lb/>
ing. The real man is not of the dust, nor is he <lb/>
<pb n="303"/>
ever created through the flesh; for his father <lb/>
and mother are the one Spirit, and his brethren <lb/>
are all the children of one parent, the eternal <lb/>
Good.</p>
<p>Any kind of literary composition was exces- <lb/>
sively difficult for Mrs. Eddy. She found it <lb/>
grinding hard work to dig out anything to say. <lb/>
She realized, at the above stage in her life, that <lb/>
with all her trouble she had not been able to <lb/>
scratch together even material enough for a <lb/>
child's Autobiography, and also that what she <lb/>
had secured was in the main not valuable, not <lb/>
important, considering the age and the fame of <lb/>
the person she was writing about; and so it oc- <lb/>
curred to her to attempt, in that paragraph, to <lb/>
excuse the meagreness and poor quality of the <lb/>
feast she was spreading, by letting on that she <lb/>
could do ever so much better if she wanted to, <lb/>
but was under constraint of Divine etiquette. <lb/>
To feed with more than a few indifferent crumbs <lb/>
a plebeian appetite for personal details about <lb/>
Personages in her class was not the correct <lb/>
thing, and she blandly points out that there is <lb/>
Precedent for this reserve. When Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
<pb n="304"/>
tries to be artful&#x2014;in literature&#x2014;it is generally <lb/>
after the manner of the ostrich; and with the <lb/>
ostrich's luck. Please try to find the connec- <lb/>
tion between the two paragraphs.&#x2014;M. T.</p>

<p><smcap>The</smcap> following is the spiritual signification of <lb/>
the Lord's Prayer:</p>
<q><lg>
<l>Principle, eternal and harmonious,</l>
<l>Nameless and adorable Intelligence,</l>
<l>Thou art ever present and supreme.</l>
<l rend="hang">And when this supremacy of Spirit shall appear, <lb/>
the dream of matter will disappear.</l>
<l>Give us the understanding of Truth and Love.</l>
<l rend="hang">And loving we shall learn God, and Truth will <lb/>
destroy all error.</l>
<l rend="hang">And lead us unto the Life that is Soul, and de- <lb/>
liver us from the errors of sense, sin, sick- <lb/>
ness, and death,</l>
<l>For God is Life, Truth, and Love for ever.</l>
<l rend="indent">&#x2014;<i>Science and Health</i>, edition of 1881.</l>
</lg></q>
<p>It seems to me that this one is distinctly <lb/>
superior to the one that was inspired for last <lb/>
year's edition. It is strange, but to my mind <lb/>
plain, that inspiring is an art which does not <lb/>
improve with practice.&#x2014;M. T.</p>

<q>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say <lb/>
unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast <lb/>
into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall <lb/>
believe that those things which he saith shall come to <lb/>
pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I <lb/>
say unto you, What things soever ye desire when ye <lb/>
pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have <lb/>
them.</q>
<q>Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, <lb/>
before ye ask Him.&#x2014;<smcap>Christ Jesus</smcap>.</q>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> prayer that reclaims the sinner and heals <lb/>
the sick, is an absolute faith that all things are <lb/>
possible to God&#x2014;a spiritual understanding of <lb/>
Him&#x2014;an unselfed love. Regardless of what <lb/>
another may say or think on this subject, I <lb/>
speak from experience. This prayer, com- <lb/>
bined with self-sacrifice and toil, is the means <lb/>
whereby God has enabled me to do what I have <lb/>
done for the religion and health of mankind.</p>
<p>Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the <lb/>
divine Mind. Desire is prayer; and no less can <lb/>
occur from trusting God with our desires, that <lb/>
<pb n="307"/>
they may be moulded and exalted before they <lb/>
take form in audible word, and in deeds.</p>
<p>What are the motives for prayer? Do we <lb/>
pray to make ourselves better, or to benefit <lb/>
those that hear us; to enlighten the Infinite, <lb/>
or to be heard of men? Are we benefited by <lb/>
praying? Yes, the desire which goes forth <lb/>
hungering after righteousness is blessed of <lb/>
our Father, and it does not return unto us <lb/>
void.</p>
<p>God is not moved by the breath of praise to <lb/>
do more than He has already done; nor can the <lb/>
Infinite do less than bestow all good, since He <lb/>
is unchanging Wisdom and Love. We can do <lb/>
more for ourselves by humble fervent petitions; <lb/>
but the All-loving does not grant them simply <lb/>
on the ground of lip-service, for He already <lb/>
knows all.</p>
<p>Prayer cannot change the Science of Being, <lb/>
but it does bring us into harmony with it. <lb/>
Goodness reaches the demonstration of Truth. <lb/>
A request that another may work for us never <lb/>
does our work. The habit of pleading with the <lb/>
divine Mind, as one pleads with a human being, <lb/>
perpetuates the belief in God as humanly cir- <lb/>
<pb n="308"/>
cumscribed&#x2014;an error which impedes spiritual <lb/>
growth.</p>
<p>God is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? <lb/>
God is Intelligence. Can we inform the infinite <lb/>
Mind, or tell Him anything He does not already <lb/>
comprehend? Do we hope to change perfec- <lb/>
tion? Shall we plead for more at the open <lb/>
fount, which always pours forth more than we <lb/>
receive? The unspoken prayer does bring us <lb/>
nearer the Source of all existence and blessed- <lb/>
ness.</p>
<p>Asking God to <i>be</i> God is a "vain repetition." <lb/>
God is "the same yesterday, and to-day, and <lb/>
forever"; and He who is immutably right will <lb/>
do right, without being reminded of His prov- <lb/>
ince. The wisdom of man is not sufficient to <lb/>
warrant him in advising God.</p>
<p>Who would stand before a blackboard, and <lb/>
pray the principle of mathematics to work out <lb/>
the problem? The rule is already established, <lb/>
and it is our task to work out the solution. <lb/>
Shall we ask the divine Principle of all good- <lb/>
ness to do His own work? His work is done; <lb/>
and we have only to avail ourselves of God's <lb/>
rule, in order to receive the blessing thereof.</p>
<pb n="309"/>
<p>The divine Being must be reflected by man&#x2014; <lb/>
else man is not the image and likeness of the pa- <lb/>
tient, tender, and true, the one "altogether <lb/>
lovely"; but to understand God is the work of <lb/>
eternity, and demands absolute concentration <lb/>
of thought and energy.</p>
<p>How empty are our conceptions of Deity! <lb/>
We admit theoretically that God is good, om- <lb/>
nipotent, omnipresent, infinite, and then we <lb/>
try to give information to this infinite Mind; <lb/>
and plead for unmerited pardon, and a liberal <lb/>
outpouring of benefactions. Are we really <lb/>
grateful for the good already received? Then <lb/>
we shall avail ourselves of the blessings we <lb/>
have, and thus be fitted to receive more. Grat- <lb/>
itude is much more than a verbal expression of <lb/>
thanks. Action expresses more gratitude than <lb/>
speech.</p>
<p>If we are ungrateful for Life, Truth, and <lb/>
Love, and yet return thanks to God for all <lb/>
blessings, we are insincere; and incur the sharp <lb/>
censure our Master pronounces on hypocrites. <lb/>
In such a case the only acceptable prayer is to <lb/>
put the finger on the lips and remember our <lb/>
blessings. While the heart is far from divine <lb/>
<pb n="310"/>
Truth and Love, we cannot conceal the ingrat- <lb/>
itude of barren lives, for God knoweth all <lb/>
things.</p>
<p>What we most need is the prayer of fervent <lb/>
desire for growth in grace, expressed in pa- <lb/>
tience, meekness, love, and good deeds. To <lb/>
keep the commandments of our Master and <lb/>
follow his example, is our proper debt to Him, <lb/>
and the only worthy evidence of our gratitude <lb/>
for all He has done. Outward worship is not <lb/>
of itself sufficient to express loyal and heartfelt <lb/>
gratitude, since He has said: "If ye love Me, <lb/>
keep My Commandments."</p>
<p>The habitual struggle to be always good, is <lb/>
unceasing prayer. Its motives are made mani- <lb/>
fest in the blessings they bring&#x2014;which, if not <lb/>
acknowledged in audible words, attest our <lb/>
worthiness to be made partakers of Love.</p>
<p>Simply asking that we may love God will <lb/>
never make us love Him; but the longing to be <lb/>
better and holier&#x2014;expressed in daily watch- <lb/>
fulness, and in striving to assimilate more of <lb/>
the divine character&#x2014;this will mould and <lb/>
fashion us anew, until we awake in His likeness. <lb/>
We reach the Science of Christianity through <lb/>
<pb n="311"/>
demonstration of the divine nature; but in this <lb/>
wicked world goodness will "be evil spoken of," <lb/>
and patience must work experience.</p>
<p>Audible prayer can never do the works <lb/>
of spiritual understanding, which regenerates; <lb/>
but silent prayer, watchfulness, and devout <lb/>
obedience, enable us to follow Jesus' example. <lb/>
Long prayers, ecclesiasticism, and creeds, have <lb/>
clipped the divine pinions of Love, and clad <lb/>
religion in human robes. They materialize <lb/>
worship, hinder the Spirit, and keep man from <lb/>
demonstrating his power over error.</p>
<p>Sorrow for wrong-doing is but one step tow- <lb/>
ards reform, and the very easiest step. The <lb/>
next and great step required by Wisdom is <lb/>
the test of our sincerity&#x2014;namely, reformation. <lb/>
To this end we are placed under the stress of <lb/>
circumstances. Temptation bids us repeat the <lb/>
offence, and woe comes in return for what is <lb/>
done. So it will ever be, till we learn that <lb/>
there is no discount in the law of justice, and <lb/>
that we must pay "the uttermost farthing." <lb/>
The measure ye mete "shall be measured to <lb/>
you again," and it will be full "and running <lb/>
over."</p>
<pb n="312"/>
<p>Saints and sinners get their full award, but <lb/>
not always in this world. The followers of <lb/>
Christ drank His cup. Ingratitude and perse- <lb/>
cution filled it to the brim; but God pours the <lb/>
riches of His love into the understanding and <lb/>
affections, giving us strength according to our <lb/>
day. Sinners flourish "like a green bay-tree"; <lb/>
but, looking farther, the Psalmist could see <lb/>
their end&#x2014;namely, the destruction of sin <lb/>
through suffering.</p>
<p>Prayer is sometimes used, as a confessional, <lb/>
to cancel sin. This error impedes true religion. <lb/>
Sin is forgiven, only as it is destroyed by Christ <lb/>
&#x2014;Truth and Life. If prayer nourishes the be- <lb/>
lief that sin is cancelled, and that man is made <lb/>
better by merely praying, it is an evil. He <lb/>
grows worse who continues in sin because he <lb/>
thinks himself forgiven.</p>
<p>An apostle says that the Son of God (Christ) <lb/>
came to "destroy the works of the devil." We <lb/>
should follow our divine Exemplar, and seek <lb/>
the destruction of all evil works, error and dis- <lb/>
ease included. We cannot escape the penalty <lb/>
due for sin. The Scriptures say, that if we <lb/>
deny Christ, "He also will deny us."</p>
<pb n="313"/>
<p>The divine Love corrects and governs man. <lb/>
Men may pardon, but this divine Principle <lb/>
alone reforms the sinner. God is not separate <lb/>
from the wisdom He bestows. The talents He <lb/>
gives we must improve. Calling on Him to <lb/>
forgive our work, badly done or left undone, <lb/>
implies the vain supposition that we have noth- <lb/>
ing to do but to ask pardon, and that after- <lb/>
wards we shall be free to repeat the offence.</p>
<p>To cause suffering, as the result of sin, is the <lb/>
means of destroying sin. Every supposed pleas- <lb/>
ure in sin will furnish more than its equiv- <lb/>
alent of pain, until belief in material life and <lb/>
sin is destroyed. To reach heaven, the har- <lb/>
mony of Being, we must understand the divine <lb/>
Principle of Being.</p>
<p>"God is Love." More than this we cannot <lb/>
ask; higher we cannot look; farther we cannot <lb/>
go. To suppose that God forgives or punishes <lb/>
sin, according as His mercy is sought or un- <lb/>
sought, is to misunderstand Love and make <lb/>
prayer the safety-valve for wrong-doing.</p>
<p>Jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before He <lb/>
cast it out. Of a sick woman He said that <lb/>
Satan had bound her; and to Peter He said, <lb/>
<pb n="314"/>
"Thou art an offence unto me. He came <lb/>
teaching and showing men how to destroy sin, <lb/>
sickness, and death. He said of the fruitless <lb/>
tree, "It is hewn down."</p>
<p>It is believed by many that a certain magis- <lb/>
trate, who lived in the time of Jesus, left this <lb/>
record: "His rebuke is fearful." The strong <lb/>
language of our Master confirms this descrip- <lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>The only civil sentence which He had for <lb/>
error was, "Get thee behind Me, Satan." Still <lb/>
stronger evidence that Jesus' reproof was <lb/>
pointed and pungent is in His own words&#x2014; <lb/>
showing the necessity for such forcible utter- <lb/>
ance, when He cast out devils and healed the <lb/>
sick and sinful. The relinquishment of error <lb/>
deprives material sense of its false claims.</p>
<p>Audible prayer is impressive; it gives mo- <lb/>
mentary solemnity and elevation to thought; <lb/>
but does it produce any lasting benefit? Look- <lb/>
ing deeply into these things, we find that "a <lb/>
zeal &#x2026; not according to knowledge," gives oc- <lb/>
casion for reaction unfavorable to spiritual <lb/>
growth, sober resolve, and wholesome per- <lb/>
ception of God's requirements. The motives <lb/>
<pb n="315"/>
for verbal prayer may embrace too much love <lb/>
of applause to induce or encourage Christian <lb/>
sentiment.</p>
<p>Physical sensation, not Soul, produces ma- <lb/>
terial ecstasy, and emotions. If spiritual sense <lb/>
always guided men at such times, there would <lb/>
grow out of those ecstatic moments a higher <lb/>
experience and a better life, with more devout <lb/>
self-abnegation, and purity. A self-satisfied <lb/>
ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes <lb/>
a Christian. God is not influenced by man. <lb/>
The "divine ear" is not an auditorial nerve. It <lb/>
is the all-hearing and all - knowing Mind, to <lb/>
whom each want of man is always known, and <lb/>
by whom it will be supplied.</p>
<p>The danger from audible prayer is, that it <lb/>
may lead us into temptation. By it we may <lb/>
become involuntary hypocrites, uttering de- <lb/>
sires which are not real, and consoling our- <lb/>
selves in the midst of sin, with the recollection <lb/>
that we have prayed over it&#x2014;or mean to ask <lb/>
forgiveness at some later day. Hypocrisy is <lb/>
fatal to religion.</p>
<p>A wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of <lb/>
self-justification, though it makes the sinner a <lb/>
<pb n="316"/>
hypocrite. We never need despair of an hon- <lb/>
est heart; but there is little hope for those who <lb/>
only come spasmodically face to face with their <lb/>
wickedness, and then seek to hide it. Their <lb/>
prayers are indexes which do not correspond <lb/>
with their character. They hold secret fellow- <lb/>
ship with sin; and such externals are spoken of <lb/>
by Jesus as "like unto whited sepulchres &#x2026; <lb/>
full of all uncleanness."</p>
<p>If a man, though apparently fervent and <lb/>
prayerful, is impure, and therefore insincere, <lb/>
what must be the comment upon him? If he <lb/>
had reached the loftiness of his prayer, there <lb/>
would be no occasion for such comment. If <lb/>
we feel the aspiration, humility, gratitude, and <lb/>
love which our words express&#x2014;this God ac- <lb/>
cepts; and it is wise not to try to deceive our- <lb/>
selves or others, for "there is nothing covered <lb/>
that shall not be revealed." Professions and <lb/>
audible prayers are like charity in one respect <lb/>
&#x2014;they "cover a multitude of sins." Praying <lb/>
for humility, with whatever fervency of ex- <lb/>
pression, does not always mean a desire for it. <lb/>
If we turn away from the poor, we are not <lb/>
ready to receive the reward of Him who blesses <lb/>
<pb n="317"/>
the poor. We confess to having a very wicked <lb/>
heart, and ask that it may be laid bare before <lb/>
us, but do we not already know more of this <lb/>
heart than we are willing to have our neighbor <lb/>
see?</p>
<p>We ought to examine ourselves, and learn <lb/>
what is the affection and purpose of the heart; <lb/>
for this alone can show us what we honestly <lb/>
are. If a friend informs us of a fault, do we <lb/>
listen to the rebuke patiently, and credit what <lb/>
is said? Do we not rather give thanks that we <lb/>
are "not as other men?" During many years <lb/>
the author has been most grateful for merited <lb/>
rebuke. The sting lies in unmerited censure&#x2014; <lb/>
in the falsehood which does no one any good.</p>
<p>The test of all prayer lies in the answer to <lb/>
these questions: Do we love our neighbor better <lb/>
because of this asking? Do we pursue the old <lb/>
selfishness, satisfied with having prayed for <lb/>
something better, though we give no evidence <lb/>
of the sincerity of our requests by living con- <lb/>
sistently with our prayer? If selfishness has <lb/>
given place to kindness, we shall regard our <lb/>
neighbor unselfishly, and bless them that curse <lb/>
us; but we shall never meet this great duty by <lb/>
<pb n="318"/>
simply asking that it may be done. There is a <lb/>
cross to be taken up, before we can enjoy the <lb/>
fruition of our hope and faith.</p>
<p>Dost thou "love the Lord thy God with all <lb/>
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all <lb/>
thy mind?" This command includes much&#x2014; <lb/>
even the surrender of all merely material sen- <lb/>
sation, affection, and worship. This is the El <lb/>
Dorado of Christianity. It involves the Sci- <lb/>
ence of Life, and recognizes only the divine <lb/>
control of Spirit, wherein Soul is our master, <lb/>
and material sense and human will have no <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>Are you willing to leave all for Christ, for <lb/>
Truth, and so be counted among sinners? No! <lb/>
Do you really desire to attain this point? No! <lb/>
Then why make long prayers about it, and ask <lb/>
to be Christians, since you care not to tread in <lb/>
the footsteps of our dear Master? If unwilling <lb/>
to follow His example, wherefore pray with <lb/>
the lips that you may be partakers of His nat- <lb/>
ure? Consistent prayer is the desire to do <lb/>
right. Prayer means that we desire to, and <lb/>
will, walk in the light so far as we receive it, <lb/>
even though with bleeding footsteps, and wait- <lb/>
<pb n="319"/>
ing patiently on the Lord, will leave our real <lb/>
desires to be rewarded by Him.</p>
<p>The world must grow to the spiritual un- <lb/>
derstanding of prayer. If good enough to <lb/>
profit by Jesus' cup of earthly sorrows, God <lb/>
will sustain us under these sorrows. Until we <lb/>
are thus divinely qualified, and willing to drink <lb/>
His cup, millions of vain repetitions will never <lb/>
pour into prayer the unction of Spirit, in dem- <lb/>
onstration of power, and "with signs follow- <lb/>
ing." Christian Science reveals a necessity for <lb/>
overcoming the world, the flesh and evil, and <lb/>
thus destroying all error.</p>
<p>Seeking is not sufficient. It is striving which <lb/>
enables us to enter. Spiritual attainments open <lb/>
the door to a higher understanding of the di- <lb/>
vine Life.</p>
<p>One of the forms of worship in Thibet is to <lb/>
carry a praying-machine through the streets, <lb/>
and stop at the doors to earn a penny by grind- <lb/>
ing out a prayer; whereas civilization pays for <lb/>
clerical prayers, in lofty edifices. Is the differ- <lb/>
ence very great, after all?</p>
<p>Experience teaches us that we do not al- <lb/>
ways receive the blessings we ask for in prayer. <lb/>
<pb n="320"/>
There is some misapprehension of the source <lb/>
and means of all goodness and blessedness, or <lb/>
we should certainly receive what we ask for, <lb/>
The Scriptures say: "Ye ask, and receive not, <lb/>
because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it <lb/>
upon your lusts." What we desire and ask for <lb/>
it is not always best for us to receive. In this <lb/>
case infinite Love will not grant the request. <lb/>
Do you ask Wisdom to be merciful, and not <lb/>
punish sin? Then "ye ask amiss." Without <lb/>
punishment, sin would multiply. Jesus' prayer, <lb/>
"forgive us our debts," specified also the terms <lb/>
of forgiveness. When forgiving the adulterous <lb/>
woman He said, "Go, and sin no more."</p>
<p>A magistrate sometimes remits the penalty, <lb/>
but this may be no moral benefit to the crim- <lb/>
inal; and at best, it only saves him from one <lb/>
form of punishment. The moral law, which <lb/>
has the right to acquit or condemn, always de- <lb/>
mands restitution, before mortals can "go up <lb/>
higher." Broken law brings penalty, in order <lb/>
to compel this progress.</p>
<p>Mere legal pardon (and there is no other, for <lb/>
divine Principle never pardons our sins or mis- <lb/>
takes till they are corrected) leaves the offender <lb/>
<pb n="321"/>
free to repeat the offence; if, indeed, he has not <lb/>
already suffered sufficiently from vice to make <lb/>
him turn from it with loathing. Truth be- <lb/>
stows no pardon upon error, but wipes it out in <lb/>
the most effectual manner. Jesus suffered for <lb/>
our sins, not to annul the divine sentence <lb/>
against an individual's sin, but to show that sin <lb/>
must bring inevitable suffering.</p>
<p>Petitions only bring to mortals the results of <lb/>
their own faith. We know that a desire for <lb/>
holiness is requisite in order to gain it; but if we <lb/>
desire holiness above all else, we shall sacrifice <lb/>
everything for it. We must be willing to do <lb/>
this, that we may walk securely in the only <lb/>
practical road to holiness. Prayer alone can- <lb/>
not change the unalterable Truth, or give us an <lb/>
understanding of it; but prayer coupled with a <lb/>
fervent habitual desire to know and do the will <lb/>
of God will bring us into all Truth. Such a de- <lb/>
sire has little need of audible expression. It is <lb/>
best expressed in thought and life.</p>

<head><b>APPENDIX E</b></head>
<p>Reverend Heber Newton on Christian Science:</p>
<p>To begin, then, at the beginning, Christian <lb/>
Science accepts the work of healing sickness as <lb/>
an integral part of the discipleship of Jesus <lb/>
Christ. In Christ it finds, what the Church has <lb/>
always recognized, theoretically, though it has <lb/>
practically ignored the fact&#x2014;the Great Physi- <lb/>
cian. That Christ healed the sick, we none of <lb/>
us question. It stands plainly upon the record. <lb/>
This ministry of healing was too large a part of <lb/>
His work to be left out from any picture of that <lb/>
life. Such service was not an incident of His <lb/>
career&#x2014;it was an essential element of that ca- <lb/>
reer. It was an integral factor in His mission. <lb/>
The Evangelists leave us no possibility of con- <lb/>
fusion on this point. Co-equal with his work of <lb/>
instruction and inspiration was His work of <lb/>
healing.</p>
<p>The records make it equally clear that the <lb/>
<pb n="323"/>
Master laid His charge upon His disciples to do <lb/>
as He had done. "When He had called unto <lb/>
Him His twelve disciples, He gave them power <lb/>
over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to <lb/>
heal all manner of sickness and all manner of <lb/>
disease."<ref target="n42"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n42" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Matt. x., 11.</p></note> In sending them forth, "He com- <lb/>
manded them, saying, &#x2026; As ye go, preach, <lb/>
saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. <lb/>
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, <lb/>
cast out demons."<ref target="n43"><sup>2</sup></ref><note id="n43" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>2</sup></seg><p><i>Ib</i>., x., 5, 7, 8.</p></note></p>
<p>That the twelve disciples undertook to do <lb/>
the Master's work of healing, and that they, in <lb/>
their measure, succeeded, seems beyond ques- <lb/>
tion. They found in themselves the same pow- <lb/>
er that the Master found in Himself, and they <lb/>
used it as He had used His power. The record <lb/>
of The Acts of the Apostles, if at all trustworthy <lb/>
history, shows that they, too, healed the sick.</p>
<p>Beyond the circle of the original twelve, it is <lb/>
equally clear that the early disciples believed <lb/>
themselves charged with the same mission, and <lb/>
that they sought to fulfil it. The records of the <lb/>
early Church make it indisputable that powers <lb/>
of healing were recognized as among the gifts of <lb/>
<pb n="324"/>
the Spirit. St. Paul's letters render it certain <lb/>
that these gifts were not a privilege of the origi- <lb/>
nal twelve, merely, but that they were the her- <lb/>
itage into which all the disciples entered.</p>
<p>Beyond the era of the primitive Church, <lb/>
through several generations, the early Chris- <lb/>
tians felt themselves called to the same ministry <lb/>
of healing, and enabled with the same secret of <lb/>
power. Through wellnigh three centuries, the <lb/>
gifts of healing appear to have been, more or <lb/>
less, recognized and exercised in the Church. <lb/>
Through those generations, however, there was <lb/>
a gradual disuse of this power, following upon <lb/>
a failing recognition of its possession. That <lb/>
which was originally the rule became the ex- <lb/>
ception. By degrees, the sense of authority <lb/>
and power to heal passed out from the con- <lb/>
sciousness of the Church. It ceased to be a <lb/>
sign of the indwelling Spirit. For fifteen cen- <lb/>
turies, the recognition of this authority and <lb/>
power has been altogether exceptional. Here <lb/>
and there, through the history of these cen- <lb/>
turies, there have been those who have entered <lb/>
into this belief of their own privilege and duty, <lb/>
and have used the gift which they recognized. <lb/>
<pb n="325"/>
The Church has never been left without a line <lb/>
of witnesses to this aspect of the discipleship of <lb/>
Christ. But she has come to accept it as the <lb/>
normal order of things that what was once the <lb/>
rule in the Christian Church should be now <lb/>
only the exception. Orthodoxy has framed a <lb/>
theory of the words of Jesus to account for this <lb/>
strange departure of His Church from them. It <lb/>
teaches us to believe that His example was not <lb/>
meant to be followed, in this respect, by all His <lb/>
disciples. The power of healing which was in <lb/>
Him was a purely exceptional power. It was <lb/>
used as an evidence of His divine mission. It <lb/>
was a miraculous gift. The gift of working <lb/>
miracles was not bestowed upon His Church at <lb/>
large. His original disciples, the twelve apos- <lb/>
tles, received this gift, as a necessity of the <lb/>
critical epoch of Christianity&#x2014;the founding of <lb/>
the Church. Traces of the power lingered on, <lb/>
in weakening activity, until they gradually <lb/>
ceased, and the normal condition of the Church <lb/>
was entered upon, in which miracles are no <lb/>
longer possible.</p>
<p>We accept this, unconsciously, as the true <lb/>
state of things in Christianity. But it is a con- <lb/>
<pb n="326"/>
ception which will not bear a moment's ex- <lb/>
amination. There is not the slightest sugges- <lb/>
tion upon record that Christ set any limit to <lb/>
this charge which He gave His disciples. On <lb/>
the contrary, there are not lacking hints that <lb/>
He looked for the possession and exercise of <lb/>
this power wherever His spirit breathed in men.</p>
<p>Even if the concluding paragraph of St. <lb/>
Mark's Gospel were a later appendix, it may <lb/>
none the less have been a faithful echo of words <lb/>
of the Master, as it certainly is a trustworthy <lb/>
record of the belief of the early Christians as to <lb/>
the thought of Jesus concerning His followers. <lb/>
In that interesting passage, Jesus, after His <lb/>
death, appeared to the eleven, and formally <lb/>
commissioned them, again, to take up His <lb/>
work in the world; bidding them, "Go ye into <lb/>
all the world and preach the gospel to every <lb/>
creature." "And these signs," He tells them, <lb/>
"shall follow them that believe"&#x2014;not the apos- <lb/>
tles only, but "them that believe," without <lb/>
limit of time; "in My name they shall cast out <lb/>
devils &#x2026; they shall lay hands on the sick and <lb/>
they shall recover."<ref target="n44"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n44" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Mark xvi., 15, 17, 18.</p></note> The concluding discourse <lb/>
<pb n="327"/>
to the disciples, recorded in the Gospel accord- <lb/>
ing to St. John, affirms the same expectation <lb/>
on the part of Jesus; emphasizing it in His <lb/>
solemn way: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, <lb/>
He that believeth on Me, the works that I do <lb/>
shall he do also; and greater works than these <lb/>
shall he do."<ref target="n45"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n45" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>John xiv., 12.</p></note></p>

<head><b>APPENDIX F</b></head>
<p><smcap>Few</smcap> will deny that an intelligence apart <lb/>
from man formed and governs the spiritual uni- <lb/>
verse and man; and this intelligence is the eternal <lb/>
Mind, and neither matter nor man created this <lb/>
intelligence and divine Principle; nor can this <lb/>
Principle produce aught unlike itself. All that <lb/>
we term sin, sickness, and death is comprised <lb/>
in the belief of matter. The realm of the real <lb/>
is spiritual; the opposite of Spirit is matter; and <lb/>
the opposite of the real is unreal or material. <lb/>
Matter is an error of statement, for there is no <lb/>
matter. This error of premises leads to error <lb/>
of conclusion in every statement of matter as a <lb/>
basis. Nothing we can say or believe regard- <lb/>
ing matter is true, except that matter is unreal, <lb/>
simply a belief that has its beginning and end- <lb/>
ing.</p>
<p>The conservative firm called matter and <lb/>
mind God never formed. The unerring and <lb/>
eternal Mind destroys this imaginary copartner- <lb/>
<pb n="329"/>
ship, formed only to be dissolved in a manner <lb/>
and at a period unknown. This copartner- <lb/>
ship is obsolete. Placed under the microscope <lb/>
of metaphysics matter disappears. Only by <lb/>
understanding there are not two, matter and <lb/>
mind, is a logical and correct conclusion ob- <lb/>
tained by either one. Science gathers not <lb/>
grapes of thorns or figs of thistles. Intelligence <lb/>
never produced non-intelligence, such as mat- <lb/>
ter: the immortal never produced mortality, <lb/>
good never resulted in evil. The science of <lb/>
Mind shows conclusively that matter is a myth. <lb/>
Metaphysics are above physics, and drag not <lb/>
matter, or what is termed that, into one of its <lb/>
premises or conclusions. Metaphysics resolves <lb/>
things into thoughts, and exchanges the ob- <lb/>
jects of sense for the ideas of Soul. These <lb/>
ideas are perfectly tangible and real to con- <lb/>
sciousness, and they have this advantage&#x2014; <lb/>
they are eternal. Mind and its thoughts com- <lb/>
prise the whole of God, the universe, and of man. <lb/>
Reason and revelation coincide with this state- <lb/>
ment, and support its proof every hour, for <lb/>
nothing is harmonious or eternal that is not <lb/>
spiritual: the realization of this will bring out <lb/>
<pb n="330"/>
objects from a higher source of thought; hence <lb/>
more beautiful and immortal.</p>
<p>The fact of spiritualization produces results <lb/>
in striking contrast to the farce of materializa- <lb/>
tion: the one produces the results of chastity <lb/>
and purity, the other the downward tendencies <lb/>
and earthward gravitation of sensualism and <lb/>
impurity.</p>
<p>The exalting and healing effects of metaphys- <lb/>
ics show their fountain. Nothing in pathology <lb/>
has exceeded the application of metaphysics. <lb/>
Through mind alone we have prevented dis- <lb/>
ease and preserved health. In cases of chronic <lb/>
and acute diseases, in their severest forms, we <lb/>
have changed the secretions, renewed structure, <lb/>
and restored health; have elongated shortened <lb/>
limbs, relaxed rigid muscles, made cicatrized <lb/>
joints supple; restored carious bones to healthy <lb/>
conditions, renewed that which is termed the <lb/>
lost substance of the lungs; and restored healthy <lb/>
organizations where disease was organic instead <lb/>
of functional.</p>

<head><b>MRS. EDDY IN ERROR</b></head>
<p><smcap>I feel</smcap> almost sure that Mrs. Eddy's inspira- <lb/>
tion-works are getting out of repair. I think <lb/>
so because they made some errors in a state- <lb/>
ment which she uttered through the press on <lb/>
the 17th of January. Not large ones, perhaps, <lb/>
still it is a friend's duty to straighten such <lb/>
things out and get them right when he can. <lb/>
Therefore I will put my other duties aside for a <lb/>
moment and undertake this helpful service. <lb/>
She said as follows:</p>
<p>"In view of the circulation of certain criti- <lb/>
cisms from the pen of Mark Twain, I submit <lb/>
the following statement:</p>
<p>"It is a fact, well understood, that I begged <lb/>
the students who first gave me the endearing <lb/>
appellative 'mother' not to name me thus. <lb/>
But, without my consent, that word spread like <lb/>
wildfire. I still must think the name is not ap- <lb/>
plicable to me. I stand in relation to this cen- <lb/>
tury as a Christian discoverer, founder, and <lb/>
<pb n="332"/>
leader. I regard self-deification as blasphe- <lb/>
mous; I may be more loved, but I am less <lb/>
lauded, pampered, provided for, and cheered <lb/>
than others before me&#x2014;and wherefore? Be- <lb/>
cause Christian Science is not yet popular, and <lb/>
I refuse adulation.</p>
<p>"My visit to the Mother-Church after it was <lb/>
built and dedicated pleased me, and the situa- <lb/>
tion was satisfactory. The dear members <lb/>
wanted to greet me with escort and the ringing <lb/>
of bells, but I declined, and went alone in my <lb/>
carriage to the church, entered it, and knelt in <lb/>
thanks upon the steps of its altar. There the <lb/>
foresplendor of the beginnings of truth fell mys- <lb/>
teriously upon my spirit. I believe in one <lb/>
Christ, teach one Christ, know of but one Christ. <lb/>
I believe in but one incarnation, one Mother <lb/>
Mary, and know I am not that one, and never <lb/>
claimed to be. It suffices me to learn the Sci- <lb/>
ence of the Scriptures relative to this subject.</p>
<p>"Christian Scientists have no quarrel with <lb/>
Protestants, Catholics, or any other sect. They <lb/>
need to be understood as following the divine <lb/>
Principle&#x2014;God, Love&#x2014;and not imagined to be <lb/>
unscientific worshippers of a human being.</p>
<p>"In the aforesaid article, of which I have <lb/>
seen only extracts, Mark Twain's wit was not <lb/>
<pb n="333"/>
wasted in certain directions. Christian Science <lb/>
eschews divine rights in human beings. If the <lb/>
individual governed human consciousness, my <lb/>
statement of Christian Science would be dis- <lb/>
proved, but to understand the spiritual idea is <lb/>
essential to demonstrate Science and its pure <lb/>
monotheism&#x2014;one God, one Christ, no idolatry, <lb/>
no human propaganda. Jesus taught and <lb/>
proved that what feeds a few feeds all. His <lb/>
life-work subordinated the material to the spir- <lb/>
itual, and He left this legacy of truth to man- <lb/>
kind. His metaphysics is not the sport of phi- <lb/>
losophy, religion, or Science; rather it is the <lb/>
pith and finale of them all.</p>
<p>"I have not the inspiration or aspiration to <lb/>
be a first or second Virgin-Mother&#x2014;her dupli- <lb/>
cate, antecedent, or subsequent. What I am <lb/>
remains to be proved by the good I do. We <lb/>
need much humility, wisdom, and love to per- <lb/>
form the functions of foreshadowing and fore- <lb/>
tasting heaven within us. This glory is molten <lb/>
in the furnace of affliction."</p>
<p>She still thinks the name of Our Mother not <lb/>
applicable to her; and she is also able to remem- <lb/>
ber that it distressed her when it was conferred <lb/>
upon her, and that she begged to have it sup- <lb/>
<pb n="334"/>
pressed. Her memory is at fault here. If she <lb/>
will take her By-laws, and refer to Section 1 <lb/>
of Article XXII., written with her own hand&#x2014; <lb/>
she will find that she has reserved that title to <lb/>
herself, and is so pleased with it, and so&#x2014;may <lb/>
we say jealous?&#x2014;about it, that she threatens <lb/>
with excommunication any sister Scientist who <lb/>
shall call herself by it. This is that Section 1:</p>
<p>"<i>The Title of Mother</i>. In the year 1895 loyal <lb/>
Christian Scientists had given to the author <lb/>
of their text-book, the Founder of Christian <lb/>
Science, the individual, endearing term of <lb/>
Mother. Therefore, if a student of Christian <lb/>
Science shall apply this title, either to herself <lb/>
or to others, except as the term for kinship ac- <lb/>
cording to the flesh, it shall be regarded by the <lb/>
Church as an indication of disrespect for their <lb/>
Pastor Emeritus, and unfitness to be a member <lb/>
of the Mother-Church."</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is herself the Mother-Church&#x2014;its <lb/>
powers and authorities are in her possession <lb/>
solely&#x2014;and she can abolish that title whenever <lb/>
it may please her to do so. She has only to <lb/>
command her people, wherever they may be in <lb/>
<pb n="335"/>
the earth, to use it no more, and it will <lb/>
never be uttered again. She is aware of <lb/>
this.</p>
<p>It may be that she "refuses adulation" when <lb/>
she is not awake, but when she is awake she <lb/>
encourages it and propagates it in that museum <lb/>
called "Our Mother's Room," in her Church <lb/>
in Boston. She could abolish that institution <lb/>
with a word, if she wanted to. She is aware of <lb/>
that. I will say a further word about the mu- <lb/>
seum presently.</p>
<p>Further down the column, her memory is un- <lb/>
faithful again:</p>
<p>"I believe in &#x2026; but one Mother Mary, and <lb/>
know I am not that one, and never claimed to <lb/>
be."</p>
<p>At a session of the National Christian <lb/>
Science Association, held in the city of New <lb/>
York on the 27th of May, 1890, the secretary <lb/>
was "instructed to send to our Mother greetings <lb/>
and words of affection from her assembled chil- <lb/>
dren."<ref target="n46"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n46" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Page 24, Official Report.</p></note></p>
<pb n="336"/>
<p>Her telegraphic response was read to the As- <lb/>
sociation at next day's meeting:</p>
<p>"All hail! He hath filled the hungry with <lb/>
good things and the sick hath He not sent <lb/>
empty away.&#x2014;<smcap>Mother Mary</smcap>."<ref target="n47"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n47" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Page 24, Official Report.</p></note></p>
<p>Which Mother Mary is this one? Are there <lb/>
two? If so, she is both of them; for, when she <lb/>
signed this telegram in this satisfied and unpro- <lb/>
testing way, the Mother-title which she was <lb/>
going to so strenuously object to, and put from <lb/>
her with humility, and seize with both hands, <lb/>
and reserve as her sole property, and protect <lb/>
her monopoly of it with a stern By-law, while <lb/>
recognizing with diffidence that it was "not <lb/>
applicable" to her (then and to-day)&#x2014;<i>that</i> <lb/>
Mother-title was not yet born, and would not be <lb/>
offered to her until five years later. The date <lb/>
of the above "Mother Mary" is 1890; the "in- <lb/>
dividual, endearing title of Mother" was given <lb/>
her "in 1895"&#x2014;according to her own testi- <lb/>
mony. See her By-law quoted above.</p>
<p>In his opening Address to that Convention of <lb/>
<pb n="337"/>
1890, the President recognized this Mary&#x2014;our <lb/>
Mary&#x2014;and abolished all previous ones. He <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"There is but one Moses, one Jesus; and there <lb/>
is but one Mary."<ref target="n48"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n48" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Page 13, Official Report.</p></note></p>
<p>The confusions being now dispersed, we <lb/>
have this clarified result:</p>
<p>There had <i>been</i> a Moses at one time, and only <lb/>
one; there had <i>been</i> a Jesus at one time, and <lb/>
only one; there <i>is</i> a Mary and "only one." She <lb/>
is not a Has Been, she is an Is&#x2014;the "Author of <lb/>
<i>Science and Health;</i> and we cannot ignore <lb/>
her."<ref target="n49"><sup>2</sup></ref><note id="n49" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>2</sup></seg><p><i>Ibid.</i></p></note></p>
<list>
<item>1. In 1890, there was but one Mother Mary. <lb/>
The President said so.</item>
<item>2. Mrs. Eddy was that one. She said so, in <lb/>
signing the telegram.</item>
<item>3. Mrs. Eddy was not that one&#x2014;for she says <lb/>
so, in her Associated Press utterance of Jan- <lb/>
uary 17th.</item>
<item>4. And has "never claimed to be" that one&#x2014; <lb/>
unless the signature to the telegram is a claim</item>
</list>
<pb n="338"/>
<p>Thus it stands proven and established that <lb/>
she is that Mary and isn't, and thought she was <lb/>
and knows she wasn't. That much is clear.</p>
<p>She is also "The Mother," by the election of <lb/>
1895, and did not want the title, and thinks it <lb/>
is not applicable to her, and will excommunicate <lb/>
any one that tries to take it away from her. <lb/>
So that is clear.</p>
<p>I think that the only really troublesome con- <lb/>
fusion connected with these particular matters <lb/>
has arisen from the name&#x2014;Mary. Much vex- <lb/>
ation, much misunderstanding, could have been <lb/>
avoided if Mrs. Eddy had used some of her <lb/>
other names in place of that one. "Mother <lb/>
Mary" was certain to stir up discussion. It <lb/>
would have been much better if she had sign- <lb/>
ed the telegram "Mother Baker"; then there <lb/>
would have been no Biblical competition, and, <lb/>
of course, that is a thing to avoid. But it is <lb/>
not too late, yet.</p>
<p>I wish to break in here with a parenthesis, <lb/>
and then take up this examination of Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy's Claim<ref target="n50"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n50" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>"<i>Claim</i>." In Christian Science terminology, "Claims" <lb/>
are errors of mortal mind, fictions of the imagination.</p></note> of January 17th again.</p>
<pb n="339"/>
<p>The history of her "Mother Mary" telegram <lb/>
&#x2014;as told to me by one who ought to be a very <lb/>
good authority&#x2014;is curious and interesting. <lb/>
The telegram ostensibly quotes verse 53 from <lb/>
the "Magnificat," but really makes some pretty <lb/>
formidable changes in it. This is St. Luke's <lb/>
version:</p>
<p>"He hath filled the hungry with good things, <lb/>
and the <i>rich</i> He hath sent empty away."</p>
<p>This is "Mother Mary's" telegraphed ver- <lb/>
sion:</p>
<p>"He hath filled the hungry with good things, <lb/>
and the <i>sick</i> hath He <i>not</i> sent empty away."<ref target="n51"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n51" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Page 24, Official Report.</p></note></p>
<p>To judge by the Official Report, the bursting <lb/>
of this bombshell in that massed convention of <lb/>
trained Christians created no astonishment, <lb/>
since it caused no remark, and the business of <lb/>
the convention went tranquilly on, thereafter, <lb/>
as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Did those people detect those changes? We <lb/>
<pb n="340"/>
cannot know. I think they must have noticed <lb/>
them, the wording of St. Luke's verse being as <lb/>
familiar to all Christians as is the wording of <lb/>
the Beatitudes; and I think that the reason <lb/>
the new version provoked no surprise and no <lb/>
comment was, that the assemblage took it for a <lb/>
"Key"&#x2014;a spiritualized explanation of verse <lb/>
53, newly sent down from heaven through Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy. For all Scientists study their Bibles <lb/>
diligently, and they know their Magnificat. I <lb/>
believe that their confidence in the authenticity <lb/>
of Mrs. Eddy's inspirations is so limitless and <lb/>
so firmly established that no change, however <lb/>
violent, which she might make in a Bible text <lb/>
could disturb their composure or provoke from <lb/>
them a protest.</p>
<p>Her improved rendition of verse 53 went into <lb/>
the convention's report and appeared in a New <lb/>
York paper the next day. The (at that time) <lb/>
Scientist whom I mentioned a minute ago, and <lb/>
who had not been present at the convention, <lb/>
saw it and marvelled; marvelled and was in- <lb/>
dignant&#x2014;indignant with the printer or the <lb/>
telegrapher, for making so careless and so <lb/>
dreadful an error. And greatly distressed, too; <lb/>
<pb n="341"/>
for, of course, the newspaper people would fall <lb/>
foul of it, and be sarcastic, and make fun of it, <lb/>
and have a blithe time over it, and be properly <lb/>
thankful for the chance. It shows how inno- <lb/>
cent he was; it shows that he did not know the <lb/>
limitations of newspaper men in the matter of <lb/>
Biblical knowledge. The new verse 53 raised <lb/>
no insurrection in the press; in fact, it was not <lb/>
even remarked upon; I could have told him the <lb/>
boys would not know there was anything the <lb/>
matter with it. I have been a newspaper man <lb/>
myself, and in those days I had my limitations <lb/>
like the others.</p>
<p>The Scientist hastened to Concord and told <lb/>
Mrs. Eddy what a disastrous mistake had been <lb/>
made, but he found to his bewilderment that <lb/>
she was tranquil about it, and was not propos- <lb/>
ing to correct it. He was not able to get her <lb/>
to promise to make a correction. He asked her <lb/>
secretary if he had heard aright when the tele- <lb/>
gram was dictated to him; the secretary said he <lb/>
had, and took the filed copy of it and verified <lb/>
its authenticity by comparing it with the sten- <lb/>
ographic notes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy did make the correction, two <lb/>
<pb n="342"/>
months later, in her official organ. It attracted <lb/>
no attention among the Scientists; and, naturally, <lb/>
none elsewhere, for that periodical's circulation <lb/>
was practically confined to disciples of the cult.</p>
<p>That is the tale as it was told to me by an <lb/>
ex-Scientist. Verse 53&#x2014;renovated and spirit- <lb/>
ualized&#x2014;had a narrow escape from a tremen- <lb/>
dous celebrity. The newspaper men would <lb/>
have made it as famous as the assassination <lb/>
of C&#x00E6;sar, but for their limitations.</p>
<p>To return to the Claim. I find myself greatly <lb/>
embarrassed by Mrs. Eddy's remark: "I regard <lb/>
self-deification as blasphemous." If she is <lb/>
right about that, I have written a half-ream of <lb/>
manuscript this past week which I must not <lb/>
print, either in the book which I am writing, or <lb/>
elsewhere: for it goes into that very matter with <lb/>
extensive elaboration, citing, in detail, words <lb/>
and acts of Mrs. Eddy's which seem to me to <lb/>
prove that she is a faithful and untiring wor- <lb/>
shipper of herself, and has carried self-deifica- <lb/>
tion to a length which has not been before vent- <lb/>
ured in ages. If ever. There is not room <lb/>
enough in this chapter for that Survey, but I <lb/>
can epitomize a portion of it here.</p>
<pb n="343"/>
<p>With her own untaught and untrained mind, <lb/>
and without outside help, she has erected upon <lb/>
a firm and lasting foundation the most minutely <lb/>
perfect, and wonderful, and smoothly and ex- <lb/>
actly working, and best safe-guarded system of <lb/>
government that has yet been devised in the <lb/>
world, as I believe, and as I am sure I could <lb/>
prove if I had room for my documentary evi- <lb/>
dences here.</p>
<p>It is a despotism (on this democratic soil); a <lb/>
sovereignty more absolute than the Roman <lb/>
Papacy, more absolute than the Russian Czar- <lb/>
ship; it has not a single power, not a shred of <lb/>
authority, legislative or executive, which is not <lb/>
lodged solely in the sovereign; all its dreams, <lb/>
its functions, its energies, have a single object, <lb/>
a single reason for existing, and only the <lb/>
one&#x2014;to build to the sky the glory of the <lb/>
sovereign, and keep it bright to the end of <lb/>
time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is the sovereign; she devised that <lb/>
great place for herself, she occupies that throne.</p>
<p>In 1895, she wrote a little primer, a little <lb/>
body of autocratic laws, called the <i>Manual of <lb/>
The First Church of Christ, Scientist</i>, and put <lb/>
<pb n="344"/>
those laws in force, in permanence. Her gov- <lb/>
ernment is all there; all in that deceptively in- <lb/>
nocent-looking little book, that cunning little <lb/>
devilish book, that slumbering little brown vol- <lb/>
cano, with hell in its bowels. In that book she <lb/>
has planned out her system, and classified and <lb/>
defined its purposes and powers.</p>

<p>It looks fair, it looks real, but it is all a fiction. <lb/>
<pb n="346"/>
Even the little "Pastor Emeritus" is a fiction. <lb/>
Instead of being merely an honorary and orna- <lb/>
mental official, Mrs. Eddy is the only official in <lb/>
the entire body that has the slightest power. <lb/>
In her Manual, she has provided a prodigality <lb/>
of ways and forms whereby she can rid herself <lb/>
of any functionary in the government when- <lb/>
ever she wants to. The officials are all shadows, <lb/>
save herself; she is the only reality. She al- <lb/>
lows no one to hold office more than a year&#x2014; <lb/>
no one gets a chance to become over-popular <lb/>
or over-useful, and dangerous. "Excommuni- <lb/>
cation" is the favorite penalty&#x2014;it is threat- <lb/>
ened at every turn. It is evidently the pet <lb/>
dread and terror of the Church's membership.</p>
<p>The member who <i>thinks</i>, without getting his <lb/>
thought from Mrs. Eddy before uttering it, is <lb/>
banished <i>permanently</i>. One or two kinds of sin- <lb/>
ners can plead their way back into the fold, but <lb/>
this one, never. To <i>think</i>&#x2014;in the Supreme <lb/>
Church&#x2014;is the New Unpardonable Sin.</p>
<p>To nearly every severe and fierce rule, Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy adds this rivet: "<i>This By-law shall not <lb/>
be changed without the consent of the Pastor <lb/>
Emeritus</i>."</p>
<pb n="347"/>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is the entire Supreme Church, in <lb/>
her own person, in the matter of powers and <lb/>
authorities.</p>
<p>Although she has provided so many ways of <lb/>
getting rid of unsatisfactory members and offi- <lb/>
cials, she was still afraid she might have left a <lb/>
life-preserver lying around somewhere, there- <lb/>
fore she devised a rule to cover that defect. By <lb/>
applying it, she can excommunicate (and <i>this</i> <lb/>
is perpetual again) every functionary connect- <lb/>
ed with the Supreme Church, and every one of <lb/>
the twenty-five thousand members of that <lb/>
Church, at an hour's notice&#x2014;and <i>do it all by <lb/>
herself without anybody's help</i>.</p>
<p>By authority of this astonishing By-law, <lb/>
she has only to <i>say</i> a person connected with <lb/>
that Church is secretly practising hypnotism <lb/>
or mesmerism; whereupon, immediate excom- <lb/>
munication, without a hearing, is his portion! <lb/>
She does not have to order a trial and produce <lb/>
evidence&#x2014;her <i>accusation</i> is all that is necessary.</p>
<p>Where is the Pope? and where the Czar? As <lb/>
the ballad says: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Ask of the winds that far away</l>
<l>With fragments strewed the sea!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="348"/>
<p>The Branch Church's pulpit is occupied by <lb/>
two "Readers." Without them the Branch <lb/>
Church is as dead as if its throat had been cut. <lb/>
To have control, then, of the Readers, is to <lb/>
have control of the Branch Churches. Mrs. <lb/>
Eddy has that control&#x2014;a control wholly with- <lb/>
out limit, a control shared with no one.</p>
<list>
<item>1. No Reader can be appointed to any <lb/>
Church in the Christian Science world without <lb/>
her <i>express</i> approval.</item>
<item>2. She can summarily expel from his or her <lb/>
place any Reader, at home or abroad, by a <lb/>
mere <i>letter</i> of dismissal, over her signature, and <lb/>
without furnishing any reason for it, to either <lb/>
the congregation or the Reader.</item>
</list>
<p>Thus she has as absolute control over all <lb/>
Branch Churches as she has over the Supreme <lb/>
Church. This power exceeds the Pope's.</p>
<p>In simple truth, <i>she is the only absolute sov- <lb/>
ereign in all Christendom</i>. The authority of the <lb/>
other sovereigns has limits, hers has none. <lb/>
None whatever. And her yoke does not fret, <lb/>
does not offend. Many of the subjects of the <lb/>
other monarchs feel their yoke, and are restive <lb/>
under it; their loyalty is insincere. It is not so <lb/>
<pb n="349"/>
with this one's human property; their loyalty <lb/>
is genuine, earnest, sincere, enthusiastic. The <lb/>
sentiment which they feel for her is one which <lb/>
goes out in sheer perfection to no other occu- <lb/>
pant of a throne; for it is love, pure from doubt, <lb/>
envy, exaction, fault-seeking, a love whose sun <lb/>
has no spot&#x2014;that form of love, strong, great, <lb/>
uplifting, limitless, whose vast proportions are <lb/>
compassable by no word but one, the prodig- <lb/>
ious word, <i>Worship</i>. And it is not as a human <lb/>
being that her subjects worship her, but as a <lb/>
supernatural one, a divine one, one who has <lb/>
comradeship with God, and speaks by His voice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy has herself created all these per- <lb/>
sonal grandeurs and autocracies&#x2014;with others <lb/>
which I have not (in this article) mentioned. <lb/>
They place her upon an Alpine solitude and <lb/>
supremacy of power and spectacular show not <lb/>
hitherto attained by any other self-seeking en- <lb/>
slaver disguised in the Christian name, and they <lb/>
persuade me that, although she may regard <lb/>
"self-deification as blasphemous," she is as fond <lb/>
of it as I am of pie.</p>
<p>She knows about "Our Mother's Room" in <lb/>
the Supreme Church in Boston&#x2014;above referred <lb/>
<pb n="350"/>
to&#x2014;for she has been in it. In a recently <lb/>
published <i>North American Review</i> article,<ref target="n52"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n52" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>1902.</p></note> I <lb/>
quoted a lady as saying Mrs. Eddy's por- <lb/>
trait could be seen there in a shrine, lit by <lb/>
always-burning lights, and that C. S. disciples <lb/>
came there and worshipped it. That remark <lb/>
hurt the feelings of more than one Scientist. <lb/>
They said it was not true, and asked me to <lb/>
correct it. I comply with pleasure. Whether <lb/>
the portrait was there four years ago or not, it <lb/>
is not there now, for I have inquired. The <lb/>
only object in the shrine now, and lit by elec- <lb/>
trics&#x2014;and worshipped&#x2014;is an oil-portrait of the <lb/>
horse-hair <i>chair</i> Mrs. Eddy used to sit in when <lb/>
she was writing <i>Science and Health!</i> It seems <lb/>
to me that adulation has struck bottom, here.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy knows about that. She has been <lb/>
there, she has seen it, she has seen the worship- <lb/>
pers. She could abolish that sarcasm with a <lb/>
word. She withholds the word. Once more I <lb/>
seem to recognize in her exactly the same appe- <lb/>
tite for self-deification that I have for pie. We <lb/>
seem to be curiously alike; for the love of self- <lb/>
deification is really only the spiritual form of <lb/>
<pb n="351"/>
the material appetite for pie, and nothing could <lb/>
be more strikingly Christian-Scientifically "har- <lb/>
monious."</p>
<p>I note this phrase:</p>
<p>"Christian Science eschews divine rights in <lb/>
human beings."</p>
<p>"Rights" is vague; I do not know what it <lb/>
means there. Mrs. Eddy is not well acquainted <lb/>
with the English language, and she is seldom <lb/>
able to say in it what she is trying to say. She <lb/>
has no ear for the exact word, and does not <lb/>
often get it. "Rights." Does it mean "hon- <lb/>
ors?" "attributes?"</p>
<p>"Eschews." This is another umbrella where <lb/>
there should be a torch; it does not illumine the <lb/>
sentence, it only deepens the shadows. Does <lb/>
she mean "denies?" "refuses?" "forbids?" or <lb/>
something in that line? Does she mean:</p>
<p>"Christian Science denies divine honors to <lb/>
human beings?" Or:</p>
<p>"Christian Science refuses to recognize divine <lb/>
attributes in human beings?" Or:</p>
<p>"Christian Science forbids the worship of hu- <lb/>
man beings?"</p>
<pb n="352"/>
<p>The bulk of the succeeding sentence is to me <lb/>
a tunnel, but, when I emerge at this end of it, I <lb/>
seem to come into daylight. Then I seem to <lb/>
understand both sentences&#x2014;with this result:</p>
<p>"Christian Science recognizes but one God, <lb/>
forbids the worship of human beings, and re- <lb/>
fuses to recognize the possession of divine attri- <lb/>
butes by any member of the race."</p>
<p>I am subject to correction, but I think that <lb/>
that is about what Mrs. Eddy was intending to <lb/>
convey. Has her English&#x2014;which is always <lb/>
difficult to me&#x2014;beguiled me into misunder- <lb/>
standing the following remark, which she makes <lb/>
(calling herself "we," after an old regal fashion <lb/>
of hers) in her preface to her <i>Miscellaneous <lb/>
Writings</i>?<ref target="n53"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n53" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Page 3.</p></note></p>
<p>"While we entertain decided views as to the <lb/>
best method for elevating the race physically, <lb/>
morally, and spiritually, and shall express these <lb/>
views as duty demands, we shall claim no espe- <lb/>
cial gift from our divine origin, no supernat- <lb/>
ural power."</p>
<p>Was she meaning to say:</p>
<pb n="353"/>
<p>"Although I am of divine origin and gifted <lb/>
with supernatural power, I shall not draw upon <lb/>
these resources in determining the best method <lb/>
of elevating the race?"</p>
<p>If she had left out the word "our," she might <lb/>
then seem to say:</p>
<p>"I claim no especial or unusual degree of di- <lb/>
vine origin&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Which is awkward&#x2014;most awkward; for one <lb/>
either has <i>a</i> divine origin or hasn't; shares in it, <lb/>
degrees of it, are surely impossible. The idea of <lb/>
crossed breeds in cattle is a thing we can en- <lb/>
tertain, for we are used to it, and it is possible; <lb/>
but the idea of a divine mongrel is unthink- <lb/>
able.</p>
<p>Well, then, what does she mean? I am sure <lb/>
I do not know, for certain. It is the word <lb/>
"our" that makes all the trouble. With the <lb/>
"our" in, she is plainly saying "<i>my</i> divine <lb/>
origin." The word "from" seems to be in- <lb/>
tended to mean "on account of." It has to <lb/>
mean that or nothing, if "our" is allowed to <lb/>
stay. The clause then says:</p>
<p>"I shall claim no especial gift on account of <lb/>
my divine origin."</p>
<pb n="354"/>
<p>And I think that the full sentence was in- <lb/>
tended to mean what I have already suggested:</p>
<p>"Although I am of divine origin, and gifted <lb/>
with supernatural power, I shall not draw upon <lb/>
these resources in determining the best method <lb/>
of elevating the race."</p>
<p>When Mrs. Eddy copyrighted that Preface <lb/>
seven years ago, she had long been used to re- <lb/>
garding herself as a divine personage. I quote <lb/>
from Mr. F. W. Peabody's book:<ref target="n54"><sup>1</sup></ref><note id="n54" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>1</sup></seg><p>Boston: 15 Court Square.</p></note></p>
<p>"In the <i>Christian Science Journal</i> for April, <lb/>
1889, when it was her property, and published <lb/>
by her, it was claimed for her, and <i>with her <lb/>
sanction</i>, that she was equal with Jesus, and <lb/>
elaborate effort was made to establish the <lb/>
claim."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Eddy has distinctly <i>authorized</i> the <lb/>
claim in her behalf, that she herself was the <lb/>
chosen successor to and equal of Jesus."</p>
<p>The following remark in that April number, <lb/>
quoted by Mr. Peabody, indicates that her <lb/>
claim had been previously made, and had ex- <lb/>
cited "horror" among some "good people":</p>
<pb n="355"/>
<p>"Now, a word about the horror many good <lb/>
people have of our making the Author of <i>Science <lb/>
and Health</i> 'equal with Jesus.'"</p>
<p>Surely, if it had excited horror in Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
also, she would have published a disclaimer. <lb/>
She owned the paper; she could say what she <lb/>
pleased in its columns. Instead of rebuking <lb/>
her editor, she lets him rebuke those "good <lb/>
people" for objecting to the claim.</p>
<p>These things seem to throw light upon those <lb/>
words, "our [my] divine origin."</p>
<p>It may be that "Christian Science eschews <lb/>
divine rights in human beings," and forbids <lb/>
worship of any but "one God, one Christ"; <lb/>
but, if that is the case, it looks as if Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
is a very unsound Christian Scientist, and needs <lb/>
disciplining. I believe she has a serious mal- <lb/>
ady&#x2014;"self-deification"; and that it will be well <lb/>
to have one of the experts demonstrate over it.</p>
<p>Meantime, let her go on living&#x2014;for my sake. <lb/>
Closely examined, painstakingly studied, she is <lb/>
easily the most interesting person on the planet, <lb/>
and, in several ways, as easily the most ex- <lb/>
traordinary woman that was ever born upon it.</p>
<pb n="356"/>
<p>P. S.&#x2014;Since I wrote the foregoing, Mr. Mc- <lb/>
Crackan's article appeared (in the March num- <lb/>
ber of the <i>North American Review</i>). Before his <lb/>
article appeared&#x2014;that is to say, during De- <lb/>
cember, January, and February&#x2014;I had written <lb/>
a new book, a character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, <lb/>
drawn from her own acts and words, and it was <lb/>
then&#x2014;together with the three brief articles pre- <lb/>
viously published in the <i>North American Re- <lb/>
view</i>&#x2014;ready to be delivered to the printer for <lb/>
issue in book form. In that book, by accident <lb/>
and good luck, I have answered the objections <lb/>
made by Mr. McCrackan to my views, and <lb/>
therefore do not need to add an answer here. <lb/>
Also, in it I have corrected certain misstate- <lb/>
ments of mine which he has noticed, and sev- <lb/>
eral others which he has not referred to. There <lb/>
are one or two important matters of opinion <lb/>
upon which he and I are not in disagreement; <lb/>
but there are others upon which we must con- <lb/>
tinue to disagree, I suppose; indeed, I know <lb/>
we must; for instance, he believes Mrs. Eddy <lb/>
wrote <i>Science and Health</i>, whereas I am quite <lb/>
sure I can convince a person unhampered by <lb/>
predilections that she did not.</p>
<pb n="357"/>
<p>As concerns one considerable matter I hope <lb/>
to convert him. He believes Mrs. Eddy's word; <lb/>
in his article he cites her as a witness, and takes <lb/>
her testimony at par; but if he will make an <lb/>
excursion through my book when it comes out, <lb/>
and will dispassionately examine her testimo- <lb/>
nies as there accumulated, I think he will in <lb/>
candor concede that she is by a large percentage <lb/>
the most erratic and contradictory and un- <lb/>
trustworthy witness that has occupied the <lb/>
stand since the days of the lamented Ananias.</p>

<head><b>CONCLUSION</b></head>
<p><smcap>Broadly</smcap> speaking, the hostiles reject and <lb/>
repudiate all the pretensions of Christian <lb/>
Science Christianity. They affirm that it has <lb/>
added nothing new to Christianity; that it can <lb/>
do nothing that Christianity could not do and <lb/>
was not doing before Christian Science was born.</p>
<p>In that case is there no field for the new <lb/>
Christianity, no opportunity for usefulness, <lb/>
precious usefulness, great and distinguished <lb/>
usefulness? I think there is. I am far from <lb/>
being confident that it can fill it, but I will in- <lb/>
dicate that unoccupied field&#x2014;without charge <lb/>
&#x2014;and if it can conquer it, it will deserve the <lb/>
praise and gratitude of the Christian world, <lb/>
and will get it, I am sure.</p>
<p>The present Christianity makes an excellent <lb/>
private Christian, but its endeavors to make <lb/>
an excellent public one go for nothing, sub- <lb/>
stantially.</p>
<p>This is an honest nation&#x2014;in private life. <lb/>
<pb n="359"/>
The American Christian is a straight and clean <lb/>
and honest man, and in his private commerce <lb/>
with his fellows can be trusted to stand faith- <lb/>
fully by the principles of honor and honesty <lb/>
imposed upon him by his religion. But the <lb/>
moment he comes forward to exercise a public <lb/>
trust he can be confidently counted upon to <lb/>
betray that trust in nine cases out of ten, if <lb/>
"party loyalty" shall require it.</p>
<p>If there are two tickets in the field in his <lb/>
city, one composed of honest men and the <lb/>
other of notorious blatherskites and criminals, <lb/>
he will not hesitate to lay his private Christian <lb/>
honor aside and vote for the blatherskites if <lb/>
his "party honor" shall exact it. His Chris- <lb/>
tianity is of no use to him and has no influence <lb/>
upon him when he is acting in a public capac- <lb/>
ity. He has sound and sturdy private morals, <lb/>
but he has no public ones. In the last great <lb/>
municipal election in New York, almost a <lb/>
complete one-half of the votes representing <lb/>
3,500,000 Christians were cast for a ticket <lb/>
that had hardly a man on it whose earned and <lb/>
proper place was outside of a jail. But that <lb/>
vote was present at church next Sunday the <lb/>
<pb n="360"/>
same as ever, and as unconscious of its perfidy <lb/>
as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Our Congresses consist of Christians. In <lb/>
their private life they are true to every obli- <lb/>
gation of honor; yet in every session they <lb/>
violate them all, and do it without shame; <lb/>
because honor to party is above honor to <lb/>
themselves. It is an accepted law of public <lb/>
life that in it a man may soil his honor in the <lb/>
interest of party expediency&#x2014;<i>must</i> do it when <lb/>
party expediency requires it. In private life <lb/>
those men would bitterly resent&#x2014;and justly <lb/>
&#x2014;any insinuation that it would not be safe <lb/>
to leave unwatched money within their reach; <lb/>
yet you could not wound their feelings by <lb/>
reminding them that every time they vote <lb/>
ten dollars to the pension appropriation nine <lb/>
of it is stolen money and they the marauders. <lb/>
They have filched the money to take care of <lb/>
the party; they believe it was right to do it; <lb/>
they do not see how their private honor is <lb/>
affected; therefore their consciences are clear <lb/>
and at rest. By vote they do wrongful things <lb/>
every day, in the party interest, which they <lb/>
could not be persuaded to do in private life. <lb/>
<pb n="361"/>
In the interest of party expediency they give <lb/>
solemn pledges, they make solemn compacts; <lb/>
in the interest of party expediency they re- <lb/>
pudiate them without a blush. They would <lb/>
not dream of committing these strange crimes <lb/>
in private life.</p>
<p>Now then, can Christian Science introduce <lb/>
the Congressional Blush? There are Christian <lb/>
Private Morals, but there are no Christian <lb/>
Public Morals, at the polls, or in Congress or <lb/>
anywhere else&#x2014;except here and there and <lb/>
scattered around like lost comets in the solar <lb/>
system. Can Christian Science persuade the <lb/>
nation and Congress to throw away their pub- <lb/>
lic morals and use none but their private ones <lb/>
henceforth in all their activities, both public <lb/>
and private?</p>
<p>I do not think so; but no matter about me: <lb/>
there is the field&#x2014;a grand one, a splendid one, <lb/>
a sublime one, and absolutely unoccupied. <lb/>
Has Christian Science confidence enough in <lb/>
itself to undertake to enter in and try to <lb/>
possess it?</p>
<p>Make the effort, Christian Science; it is a <lb/>
most noble cause, and it might succeed. It <lb/>
<pb n="362"/>
could succeed. Then we should have a new <lb/>
literature, with romances entitled, How To Be <lb/>
an Honest Congressman Though a Christian; <lb/>
How To Be a Creditable Citizen Though a <lb/>
Christian.</p>
