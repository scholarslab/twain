<head><b>MY D&#x00C9;BUT AS A LITERARY PERSON</b></head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> those early days I had already published one <lb/>
little thing ("The Jumping Frog") in an East- <lb/>
ern paper, but I did not consider that that counted. <lb/>
In my view, a person who published things in a <lb/>
mere newspaper could not properly claim recog- <lb/>
nition as a Literary Person: he must rise away <lb/>
above that; he must appear in a magazine. He <lb/>
would then be a Literary Person; also, he would be <lb/>
famous&#x2014;right away. These two ambitions were <lb/>
strong upon me. This was in 1866. I prepared <lb/>
my contribution, and then looked around for the <lb/>
best magazine to go up to glory in. I selected the <lb/>
most important one in New York. The contribu- <lb/>
tion was accepted. I signed it "<smcap>Mark Twain</smcap>"; <lb/>
for that name had some currency on the Pacific <lb/>
coast, and it was my idea to spread it all over the <lb/>
world, now, at this one jump. The article appeared <lb/>
in the December number, and I sat up a month <lb/>
waiting for the January number; for that one would <lb/>
contain the year's list of contributors, my name <lb/>
would be in it, and I should be famous and could <lb/>
give the banquet I was meditating.</p>
<pb n="12"/>
<p>I did not give the banquet. I had not written the <lb/>
"<smcap>Mark Twain</smcap>" distinctly; it was a fresh name to <lb/>
Eastern printers, and they put it "Mike Swain" or <lb/>
"MacSwain," I do not remember which. At any <lb/>
rate, I was not celebrated, and I did not give the <lb/>
banquet. I was a Literary Person, but that was all <lb/>
&#x2014;a buried one; buried alive.</p>
<p>My article was about the burning of the clipper- <lb/>
ship <i>Hornet</i> on the line, May 3, 1866. There were <lb/>
thirty-one men on board at the time, and I was in <lb/>
Honolulu when the fifteen lean and ghostly sur- <lb/>
vivors arrived there after a voyage of forty-three <lb/>
days in an open boat, through the blazing tropics, <lb/>
on <i>ten days' rations</i> of food. A very remarkable <lb/>
trip; but it was conducted by a captain who was a <lb/>
remarkable man, otherwise there would have been <lb/>
no survivors. He was a New-Englander of the best <lb/>
sea-going stock of the old capable times&#x2014;Captain <lb/>
Josiah Mitchell.</p>
<p>I was in the islands to write letters for the weekly <lb/>
edition of the Sacramento <i>Union</i>, a rich and in- <lb/>
fluential daily journal which hadn't any use for <lb/>
them, but could afford to spend twenty dollars a <lb/>
week for nothing. The proprietors were lovable <lb/>
and well-beloved men: long ago dead, no doubt, <lb/>
but in me there is at least one person who still holds <lb/>
them in grateful remembrance; for I dearly wanted <lb/>
to see the islands, and they listened to me and gave <lb/>
me the opportunity when there was but slender <lb/>
likelihood that it could profit them in any way.</p>
<pb n="13"/>
<p>I had been in the islands several months when the <lb/>
survivors arrived. I was laid up in my room at the <lb/>
time, and unable to walk. Here was a great occa- <lb/>
sion to serve my journal, and I not able to take <lb/>
advantage of it. Necessarily I was in deep trouble. <lb/>
But by good luck his Excellency Anson Burlingame <lb/>
was there at the time, on his way to take up his post <lb/>
in China, where he did such good work for the <lb/>
United States. He came and put me on a stretcher <lb/>
and had me carried to the hospital where the ship- <lb/>
wrecked men were, and I never needed to ask a <lb/>
question. He attended to all of that himself, and I <lb/>
had nothing to do but make the notes. It was like <lb/>
him to take that trouble. He was a great man and <lb/>
a great American, and it was in his fine nature to <lb/>
come down from his high office and do a friendly <lb/>
turn whenever he could.</p>
<p>We got through with this work at six in the even- <lb/>
ing. I took no dinner, for there was no time to <lb/>
spare if I would beat the other correspondents. I <lb/>
spent four hours arranging the notes in their proper <lb/>
order, then wrote all night and beyond it; with this <lb/>
result: that I had a very long and detailed account <lb/>
of the <i>Hornet</i> episode ready at nine in the morning, <lb/>
while the correspondents of the San Francisco <lb/>
journals had nothing but a brief outline report&#x2014;for <lb/>
they did n't sit up. The now-and-then schooner was <lb/>
to sail for San Francisco about nine; when I reached <lb/>
the dock she was free forward and was just casting <lb/>
off her stern-line. My fat envelope was thrown by <lb/>
<pb n="14"/>
a strong hand, and fell on board all right, and my <lb/>
victory was a safe thing. All in due time the ship <lb/>
reached San Francisco, but it was my complete re- <lb/>
port which made the stir and was telegraphed to the <lb/>
New York papers, by Mr. Cash; he was in charge <lb/>
of the Pacific bureau of the New York <i>Herald</i> at <lb/>
the time.</p>
<p>When I returned to California by and by, I went <lb/>
up to Sacramento and presented a bill for general <lb/>
correspondence at twenty dollars a week. It was <lb/>
paid. Then I presented a bill for "special" service <lb/>
on the <i>Hornet</i> matter of three columns of solid non- <lb/>
pareil at <i>a hundred dollars a column</i>. The cashier <lb/>
didn't faint, but he came rather near it. He sent <lb/>
for the proprietors, and they came and never uttered <lb/>
a protest. They only laughed in their jolly fashion, <lb/>
and said it was robbery, but no matter; it was a <lb/>
grand "scoop" (the bill or my <i>Hornet</i> report, I <lb/>
didn't know which); "pay it. It's all right." <lb/>
The best men that ever owned a newspaper.</p>
<p>The <i>Hornet</i> survivors reached the Sandwich <lb/>
Islands the 15th of June. They were mere skinny <lb/>
skeletons; their clothes hung limp about them and <lb/>
fitted them no better than a flag fits the flagstaff in <lb/>
a calm. But they were well nursed in the hospital; <lb/>
the people of Honolulu kept them supplied with all <lb/>
the dainties they could need; they gathered strength <lb/>
fast, and were presently nearly as good as new. <lb/>
Within a fortnight the most of them took ship for <lb/>
San Francisco; that is, if my dates have not gone <lb/>
<pb n="15"/>
astray in my memory. I went in the same ship, a <lb/>
sailing-vessel. Captain Mitchell of the <i>Hornet</i> was <lb/>
along; also the only passengers the <i>Hornet</i> had <lb/>
carried. These were two young gentlemen from <lb/>
Stamford, Connecticut&#x2014;brothers: Samuel Fergu- <lb/>
son, aged twenty-eight, a graduate of Trinity Col- <lb/>
lege, Hartford, and Henry Ferguson, aged eighteen, <lb/>
a student of the same college. The elder brother <lb/>
had had some trouble with his lungs, which induced <lb/>
his physician to prescribe a long sea-voyage. This <lb/>
terrible disaster, however, developed the disease <lb/>
which later ended fatally. The younger brother is <lb/>
still living, and is fifty years old this year (1898). <lb/>
The <i>Hornet</i> was a clipper of the first class and <lb/>
a fast sailer; the young men's quarters were roomy <lb/>
and comfortable, and were well stocked with books, <lb/>
and also with canned meats and fruits to help <lb/>
out the ship-fare with; and when the ship cleared <lb/>
from New York harbor in the first week of Janu- <lb/>
ary, there was promise that she would make quick <lb/>
and pleasant work of the fourteen or fifteen thou- <lb/>
sand miles in front of her. As soon as the cold <lb/>
latitudes were left behind and the vessel entered <lb/>
summer weather, the voyage became a holiday <lb/>
picnic. The ship flew southward under a cloud of <lb/>
sail which needed no attention, no modifying or <lb/>
change of any kind, for days together. The young <lb/>
men read, strolled the ample deck, rested and <lb/>
drowsed in the shade of the canvas, took their meals <lb/>
with the captain, and when the day was done they <lb/>
<pb n="16"/>
played dummy whist with him till bedtime. After <lb/>
the snow and ice and tempests of the Horn, the ship <lb/>
bowled northward into summer weather again, and <lb/>
the trip was a picnic once more.</p>
<p>Until the early morning of the 3d of May. Com- <lb/>
puted position of the ship 112&#x00B0; 10&#x2032; west longitude; <lb/>
latitude 2&#x00B0; above the equator; no wind, no sea&#x2014; <lb/>
dead calm; temperature of the atmosphere, tropical, <lb/>
blistering, unimaginable by one who has not been <lb/>
roasted in it. There was a cry of fire. An un- <lb/>
faithful sailor had disobeyed the rules and gone into <lb/>
the booby-hatch with an open light to draw some <lb/>
varnish from a cask. The proper result followed, <lb/>
and the vessel's hours were numbered.</p>
<p>There was not much time to spare, but the cap- <lb/>
tain made the most of it. The three boats were <lb/>
launched&#x2014;long-boat and two quarter-boats. That <lb/>
the time was very short and the hurry and excite- <lb/>
ment considerable is indicated by the fact that in <lb/>
launching the boats a hole was stove in the side of <lb/>
one of them by some sort of collision, and an oar <lb/>
driven through the side of another. The captain's <lb/>
first care was to have four sick sailors brought up <lb/>
and placed on deck out of harm's way&#x2014;among <lb/>
them a "Portyghee." This man had not done a <lb/>
day's work on the voyage, but had lain in his ham- <lb/>
mock four months nursing an abscess. When we <lb/>
were taking notes in the Honolulu hospital and a <lb/>
sailor told this to Mr. Burlingame, the third mate, <lb/>
who was lying near, raised his head with an effort, <lb/>
<pb n="17"/>
and in a weak voice made this correction&#x2014;with <lb/>
solemnity and feeling:</p>
<p>"<i>Raising</i> abscesses! He had a family of them. <lb/>
He done it to keep from standing his watch."</p>
<p>Any provisions that lay handy were gathered up <lb/>
by the men and the two passengers and brought and <lb/>
dumped on the deck where the "Portyghee" lay; <lb/>
then they ran for more. The sailor who was telling <lb/>
this to Mr. Burlingame added:</p>
<p>"We pulled together thirty-two days' rations for <lb/>
the thirty-one men that way."</p>
<p>The third mate lifted his head again and made <lb/>
another correction&#x2014;with bitterness:</p>
<p>"The Portyghee et twenty-two of them while he <lb/>
was soldiering there and nobody noticing. A <lb/>
damned hound."</p>
<p>The fire spread with great rapidity. The smoke <lb/>
and flame drove the men back, and they had to stop <lb/>
their incomplete work of fetching provisions, and <lb/>
take to the boats with only ten days' rations <lb/>
secured.</p>
<p>Each boat had a compass, a quadrant, a copy <lb/>
of Bowditch's <foreign lang="ger"><i>Navigator</i>,</foreign> and a nautical almanac, <lb/>
and the captain's and chief mate's boats had chro- <lb/>
nometers. There were thirty-one men all told. <lb/>
The captain took an account of stock, with the <lb/>
following result: four hams, nearly thirty pounds <lb/>
of salt pork, half-box of raisins, one hundred <lb/>
pounds of bread, twelve two-pound cans of oysters, <lb/>
clams, and assorted meats, a keg containing four <lb/>
<pb n="18"/>
pounds of butter, twelve gallons of water in a forty- <lb/>
gallon "scuttle-butt," four one-gallon demijohns <lb/>
full of water, three bottles of brandy (the property <lb/>
of passengers), some pipes, matches, and a hundred <lb/>
pounds of tobacco. No medicines. Of course the <lb/>
whole party had to go on short rations at once.</p>
<p>The captain and the two passengers kept diaries. <lb/>
On our voyage to San Francisco we ran into a calm <lb/>
in the middle of the Pacific, and did not move a rod <lb/>
during fourteen days; this gave me a chance to <lb/>
copy the diaries. Samuel Ferguson's is the fullest; <lb/>
I will draw upon it now. When the following para- <lb/>
graph was written the ship was about one hundred <lb/>
and twenty days out from port, and all hands were <lb/>
putting in the lazy time about as usual, as no one <lb/>
was forecasting disaster.</p>
<q>May 2. Latitude 1&#x00B0; 28&#x2032; N., longitude 111&#x00B0; 38&#x2032; W. Another hot <lb/>
and sluggish day; at one time, however, the clouds promised wind, and <lb/>
there came a slight breeze&#x2014;just enough to keep us going. The only <lb/>
thing to chronicle to-day is the quantities of fish about; nine bonitos were <lb/>
caught this forenoon, and some large albacores seen. After dinner the <lb/>
first mate hooked a fellow which he could not hold, so he let the line go <lb/>
to the captain, who was on the bow. He, holding on, brought the fish <lb/>
to with a jerk, and snap went the line, hook and all. We also saw <lb/>
astern, swimming lazily after us, an enormous shark, which must have <lb/>
been nine or ten feet long. We tried him with all sorts of lines and a <lb/>
piece of pork, but he declined to take hold. I suppose he had ap- <lb/>
peased his appetite on the heads and other remains of the bonitos we <lb/>
had thrown overboard.</q>
<p>Next day's entry records the disaster. The three <lb/>
boats got away, retired to a short distance, and <lb/>
stopped. The two injured ones were leaking badly; <lb/>
<pb n="19"/>
some of the men were kept busy bailing, others <lb/>
patched the holes as well as they could. The cap- <lb/>
tain, the two passengers, and eleven men were in the <lb/>
long-boat, with a share of the provisions and water, <lb/>
and with no room to spare, for the boat was only <lb/>
twenty-one feet long, six wide, and three deep. <lb/>
The chief mate and eight men were in one of the <lb/>
small boats, the second mate and seven men in the <lb/>
other. The passengers had saved no clothing but <lb/>
what they had on, excepting their overcoats. The <lb/>
ship, clothed in flame and sending up a vast column <lb/>
of black smoke into the sky, made a grand picture <lb/>
in the solitudes of the sea, and hour after hour the <lb/>
outcasts sat and watched it. Meantime the captain <lb/>
ciphered on the immensity of the distance that <lb/>
stretched between him and the nearest available land, <lb/>
and then scaled the rations down to meet the emer- <lb/>
gency: half a biscuit for breakfast; one biscuit and <lb/>
some canned meat for dinner; half a biscuit for <lb/>
tea; a few swallows of water for each meal. And <lb/>
so hunger began to gnaw while the ship was still <lb/>
burning.</p>
<q>May 4. The ship burned all night very brightly, and hopes are that <lb/>
some ship has seen the light and is bearing down upon us. None seen, <lb/>
however, this forenoon, so we have determined to go together north and a <lb/>
little west to some islands in 18&#x00B0; or 19&#x00B0; north latitude and 114&#x00B0; to 115&#x00B0; <lb/>
west longitude, hoping in the meantime to be picked up by some ship. <lb/>
The ship sank suddenly at about 5 <smcap>a. m.</smcap> We find the sun very hot and <lb/>
scorching, but all try to keep out of it as much as we can.</q>
<p>They did a quite natural thing now: waited <lb/>
several hours for that possible ship that might have <lb/>
<pb n="20"/>
seen the light to work her slow way to them through <lb/>
the nearly dead calm. Then they gave it up and <lb/>
set about their plans. If you will look at the map <lb/>
you will say that their course could be easily de- <lb/>
cided. Albemarle Island (Galapagos group) lies <lb/>
straight eastward nearly a thousand miles; the islands <lb/>
referred to in the diary indefinitely as "some <lb/>
islands" (Revillagigedo Islands) lie, as they think, <lb/>
in some widely uncertain region northward about <lb/>
one thousand miles and westward one hundred or <lb/>
one hundred and fifty miles. Acapulco, on the <lb/>
Mexican coast, lies about northeast something <lb/>
short of one thousand miles. You will say random <lb/>
rocks in the ocean are not what is wanted; let them <lb/>
strike for Acapulco and the solid continent. That <lb/>
does look like the rational course, but one presently <lb/>
guesses from the diaries that the thing would have <lb/>
been wholly irrational&#x2014;indeed, suicidal. If the <lb/>
boats struck for Albemarle they would be in the <lb/>
doldrums all the way; and that means a watery per- <lb/>
dition, with winds which are wholly crazy, and blow <lb/>
from all points of the compass at once and also per- <lb/>
pendicularly. If the boats tried for Acapulco they <lb/>
would get out of the doldrums when half-way there, <lb/>
&#x2014;in case they ever got half-way,&#x2014;and then they <lb/>
would be in a lamentable case, for there they would <lb/>
meet the northeast trades coming down in their <lb/>
teeth, and these boats were so rigged that they <lb/>
could not sail within eight points of the wind. So <lb/>
they wisely started northward, with a slight slant to <lb/>
<pb n="21"/>
the west. They had but ten days' short allowance <lb/>
of food; the long-boat was towing the others; they <lb/>
could not depend on making any sort of definite <lb/>
progress in the doldrums, and they had four or five <lb/>
hundred miles of doldrums in front of them yet. <lb/>
<i>They</i> are the real equator, a tossing, roaring, rainy <lb/>
belt, ten or twelve hundred miles broad, which <lb/>
girdles the globe.</p>
<p>It rained hard the first night, and all got drenched, <lb/>
but they filled up their water-butt. The brothers <lb/>
were in the stern with the captain, who steered. <lb/>
The quarters were cramped; no one got much <lb/>
sleep. "Kept on our course till squalls headed us <lb/>
off."</p>
<p>Stormy and squally the next morning, with <lb/>
drenching rains. A heavy and dangerous "cob- <lb/>
bling" sea. One marvels how such boats could <lb/>
live in it. It is called a feat of desperate daring <lb/>
when one man and a dog cross the Atlantic in a <lb/>
boat the size of a long-boat, and indeed it is; but <lb/>
this long-boat was overloaded with men and other <lb/>
plunder, and was only three feet deep. "We <lb/>
naturally thought often of all at home, and were <lb/>
glad to remember that it was Sacrament Sunday, <lb/>
and that prayers would go up from our friends for <lb/>
us, although they know not our peril."</p>
<p>The captain got not even a cat-nap during the <lb/>
first three days and nights, but he got a few winks <lb/>
of sleep the fourth night. "The worst sea yet." <lb/>
About ten at night the captain changed his course <lb/>
<pb n="22"/>
and headed east-northeast, hoping to make Clipper- <lb/>
ton Rock. If he failed, no matter; he would be in <lb/>
a better position to make those other islands. I will <lb/>
mention here that he did not find that rock.</p>
<p>On the 8th of May no wind all day; sun blister- <lb/>
ing hot; they take to the oars. Plenty of dolphins, <lb/>
but they could n't catch any. "I think we are all <lb/>
beginning to realize more and more the awful situa- <lb/>
tion we are in." "It often takes a ship a week to <lb/>
get through the doldrums; how much longer, then, <lb/>
such a craft as ours." "We are so crowded that <lb/>
we cannot stretch ourselves out for a good sleep, <lb/>
but have to take it any way we can get it."</p>
<p>Of course this feature will grow more and more <lb/>
trying, but it will be human nature to cease to set it <lb/>
down; there will be five weeks of it yet&#x2014;we must <lb/>
try to remember that for the diarist; it will make <lb/>
our beds the softer.</p>
<p>The 9th of May the sun gives him a warning: <lb/>
"Looking with both eyes, the horizon crossed <lb/>
thus +." "Henry keeps well, but broods over our <lb/>
troubles more than I wish he did." They caught <lb/>
two dolphins; they tasted well. "The captain <lb/>
believed the compass out of the way, but the long- <lb/>
invisible north star came out&#x2014;a welcome sight&#x2014; <lb/>
and indorsed the compass."</p>
<p>May 10, "latitude 7&#x00B0; 0&#x2032; 3&#x2033; N., longitude 111&#x00B0; <lb/>
32&#x2032; W." So they have made about three hundred <lb/>
miles of northing in the six days since they left the <lb/>
region of the lost ship. "Drifting in calms all <lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
day." And baking hot, of course; I have been <lb/>
down there, and I remember that detail. "Even as <lb/>
the captain says, all romance has long since van- <lb/>
ished, and I think the most of us are beginning to <lb/>
look the fact of our awful situation full in the face."</p>
<p>"We are making but little headway on our <lb/>
course." Bad news from the rearmost boat: the <lb/>
men are improvident; "they have eaten up all of <lb/>
the canned meats brought from the ship, and are <lb/>
now growing discontented." Not so with the chief <lb/>
mate's people&#x2014;they are evidently under the eye of <lb/>
a <i>man</i>.</p>
<p>Under date of May 11: "Standing still! or <lb/>
worse; we lost more last night than we made yes- <lb/>
terday." In fact, they have lost three miles of the <lb/>
three hundred of northing they had so laboriously <lb/>
made. "The cock that was rescued and pitched <lb/>
into the boat while the ship was on fire still lives, <lb/>
and crows with the breaking of dawn, cheering us a <lb/>
good deal." What has he been living on for a <lb/>
week? Did the starving men feed him from their <lb/>
dire poverty? "The second mate's boat out of <lb/>
water again, showing that they overdrink their allow- <lb/>
ance. The captain spoke pretty sharply to them." <lb/>
It is true: I have the remark in my old notebook; <lb/>
I got it of the third mate in the hospital at Honolulu. <lb/>
But there is not room for it here, and it is too com- <lb/>
bustible, anyway. Besides, the third mate admired <lb/>
it, and what he admired he was likely to enhance.</p>
<p>They were still watching hopefully for ships. The <lb/>
<pb n="24"/>
captain was a thoughtful man, and probably did not <lb/>
disclose to them that that was substantially a waste <lb/>
of time. "In this latitude the horizon is filled with <lb/>
little upright clouds that look very much like ships." <lb/>
Mr. Ferguson saved three bottles of brandy from his <lb/>
private stores when he left the ship, and the liquor <lb/>
came good in these days. "The captain serves out <lb/>
two tablespoonfuls of brandy and water&#x2014;half and <lb/>
half&#x2014;to our crew." He means the watch that is <lb/>
on duty; they stood regular watches&#x2014;four hours <lb/>
on and four off. The chief mate was an excellent <lb/>
officer&#x2014;a self-possessed, resolute, fine, all-round <lb/>
man. The diarist makes the following note&#x2014;there <lb/>
is character in it: "I offered one bottle of brandy to <lb/>
the chief mate, but he declined, saying he could <lb/>
keep the after-boat quiet, and we had not enough <lb/>
for all."</p>

<q>May 4, 5, 6, doldrums. May 7, 8, 9, doldrums. May 10, 11, 12, <lb/>
doldrums. Tells it all. Never saw, never felt, never heard, never <lb/>
experienced such heat, such darkness, such lightning and thunder, and <lb/>
wind and rain, in my life before.</q>
<p>That boy's diary is of the economical sort that a <lb/>
person might properly be expected to keep in such <lb/>
circumstances&#x2014;and be forgiven for the economy, <lb/>
too. His brother, perishing of consumption, <lb/>
hunger, thirst, blazing heat, drowning rains, loss of <lb/>
sleep, lack of exercise, was persistently faithful and <lb/>
circumstantial with his diary from the first day to <lb/>
the last&#x2014;an instance of noteworthy fidelity and <lb/>
<pb n="25"/>
resolution. In spite of the tossing and plunging <lb/>
boat he wrote it close and fine, in a hand as easy <lb/>
to read as print. They can't seem to get north of <lb/>
7&#x00B0; N.; they are still there the next day: <lb/>
<q>May 12. A good rain last night, and we caught a good deal, though <lb/>
not enough to fill up our tank, pails, etc. Our object is to get out of <lb/>
these doldrums, but it seems as if we cannot do it. To-day we have had <lb/>
it very variable, and hope we are on the northern edge, though we are <lb/>
not much above 7&#x00B0;. This morning we all thought we had made out a <lb/>
sail; but it was one of those deceiving clouds. Rained a good deal to- <lb/>
day, making all hands wet and uncomfortable; we filled up pretty nearly <lb/>
all our water-pots, however. I hope we may have a fine night, for the <lb/>
captain certainly wants rest, and while there is any danger of squalls, or <lb/>
danger of any kind, he is always on hand. I never would have believed <lb/>
that open boats such as ours, with their loads, could live in some of the <lb/>
seas we have had.</q></p>
<p>During the night, 12th-13th, "the cry of <i>A ship!</i> <lb/>
brought us to our feet." It seemed to be the <lb/>
glimmer of a vessel's signal-lantern rising out of the <lb/>
curve of the sea. There was a season of breathless <lb/>
hope while they stood watching, with their hands <lb/>
shading their eyes, and their hearts in their throats; <lb/>
then the promise failed: the light was a rising star. <lb/>
It is a long time ago,&#x2014;thirty-two years,&#x2014;and it <lb/>
does n't matter now, yet one is sorry for their disap- <lb/>
pointment. "Thought often of those at home to- <lb/>
day, and of the disappointment they will feel next <lb/>
Sunday at not hearing from us by telegraph from <lb/>
San Francisco." It will be many weeks yet before <lb/>
the telegram is received, and it will come as a <lb/>
thunder-clap of joy then, and with the seeming of a <lb/>
miracle, for it will raise from the grave men <lb/>
<pb n="26"/>
mourned as dead. "To-day our rations were re- <lb/>
duced to a quarter of a biscuit a meal, with about <lb/>
half a pint of water." This is on the 13th of May, <lb/>
with more than a month of voyaging in front of <lb/>
them yet! However, as they do not know that, <lb/>
"we are all feeling pretty cheerful."</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 14th there was a thunder- <lb/>
storm, "which toward night seemed to close in around <lb/>
us on every side, making it very dark and squally." <lb/>
"Our situation is becoming more and more desper- <lb/>
ate," for they were making very little northing, <lb/>
"and every day diminishes our small stock of pro- <lb/>
visions." They realize that the boats must soon <lb/>
separate, and each fight for its own life. Towing <lb/>
the quarter-boats is a hindering business.</p>
<p>That night and next day, light and baffling winds <lb/>
and but little progress. Hard to bear, that per- <lb/>
sistent standing still, and the food wasting away. <lb/>
"Everything in a perfect sop; and all so cramped, <lb/>
and no change of clothes." Soon the sun comes <lb/>
out and roasts them. "Joe caught another dol- <lb/>
phin to-day; in his maw we found a flying-fish and <lb/>
two skip-jacks." There is an event, now, which <lb/>
rouses an enthusiasm of hope: a land-bird arrives! <lb/>
It rests on the yard for awhile, and they can look at <lb/>
it all they like, and envy it, and thank it for its <lb/>
message. As a subject of talk it is beyond price&#x2014;a <lb/>
fresh, new topic for tongues tired to death of talking <lb/>
upon a single theme: Shall we ever see the land <lb/>
again; and when? Is the bird from Clipperton <lb/>
<pb n="27"/>
Rock? They hope so; and they take heart of <lb/>
grace to believe so. As it turned out, the bird had <lb/>
no message; it merely came to mock.</p>
<p>May 16, "the cock still lives, and daily carols <lb/>
forth His praise." It will be a rainy night, "but <lb/>
I do not care if we can fill up our water-butts."</p>
<p>On the 17th one of those majestic specters of the <lb/>
deep, a water-spout, stalked by them, and they <lb/>
trembled for their lives. Young Henry set it down <lb/>
in his scanty journal with the judicious comment <lb/>
that "it might have been a fine sight from a ship."</p>
<p>From Captain Mitchell's log for this day: "<i>Only <lb/>
half a <foreign lang="spa">bushel</foreign> of bread-crumbs left</i>." (And a month <lb/>
to wander the seas yet.)</p>
<p>It rained all night and all day; everybody uncom- <lb/>
fortable. Now came a swordfish chasing a bonito; <lb/>
and the poor thing, seeking help and friends, took <lb/>
refuge under the rudder. The big swordfish kept <lb/>
hovering around, scaring everybody badly. The <lb/>
men's mouths watered for him, for he would have <lb/>
made a whole banquet; but no one dared to touch <lb/>
him, of course, for he would sink a boat promptly <lb/>
if molested. Providence protected the poor bonito <lb/>
from the cruel swordfish. This was just and right. <lb/>
Providence next befriended the shipwrecked sailors: <lb/>
they got the bonito. This was also just and right. <lb/>
But in the distribution of mercies the swordfish him- <lb/>
self got overlooked. He now went away; to muse <lb/>
over these subtleties, probably. "The men in all the <lb/>
boats seem pretty well; the feeblest of the sick ones <lb/>
<pb n="28"/>
(not able for a long time to stand his watch on <lb/>
board the ship) is wonderfully recovered." This is <lb/>
the third mate's detested "Portyghee", that raised <lb/>
the family of abscesses.</p>
<q>Passed a most awful night. Rained hard nearly all the time, and blew <lb/>
in squalls, accompanied by terrific thunder and lightning, from all points <lb/>
of the compass.&#x2014;<i>Henry's Log</i>.</q>
<q>Most awful night I ever witnessed.&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log</i>.</q>
<p>Latitude, May 18, 11&#x00B0; 11&#x2032;. So they have aver- <lb/>
aged but forty miles of northing a day during the <lb/>
fortnight. Further talk of separating. "Too bad, <lb/>
but it must be done for the safety of the whole." <lb/>
"At first I never dreamed, but now hardly shut my <lb/>
eyes for a cat-nap without conjuring up something <lb/>
or other&#x2014;to be accounted for by weakness, I sup- <lb/>
pose." But for their disaster they think they would <lb/>
be arriving in San Francisco about this time. "I <lb/>
should have liked to send B<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> the telegram for <lb/>
her birthday." This was a young sister.</p>
<p>On the 19th the captain called up the quarter- <lb/>
boats and said one would have to go off on its own <lb/>
hook. The long-boat could no longer tow both of <lb/>
them. The second mate refused to go, but the chief <lb/>
mate was ready; in fact, he was always ready when <lb/>
there was a man's work to the fore. He took the <lb/>
second mate's boat; six of its crew elected to re- <lb/>
main, and two of his own crew came with him (nine <lb/>
in the boat, now, including himself). He sailed <lb/>
away, and toward sunset passed out of sight. The <lb/>
diarist was sorry to see him go. It was natural; <lb/>
<pb n="29"/>
one could have better spared the "Portyghee." <lb/>
After thirty-two years I find my prejudice against <lb/>
this "Portyghee" reviving. His very looks have <lb/>
long passed out of my memory; but no matter, I <lb/>
am coming to hate him as religiously as ever. <lb/>
"Water will now be a scarce article, for as we get <lb/>
out of the doldrums we shall get showers only now <lb/>
and then in the trades. This life is telling severely <lb/>
on my strength. Henry holds out first-rate." <lb/>
Henry did not start well, but under hardships he im- <lb/>
proved straight along.</p>
<p>Latitude, Sunday, May 20, 12&#x00B0; o&#x2032; 9&#x2033;. They <lb/>
ought to be well out of the doldrums now, but they <lb/>
are not. No breeze&#x2014;the longed-for trades still <lb/>
missing. They are still anxiously watching for a <lb/>
sail, but they have only "visions of ships that come <lb/>
to naught&#x2014;the shadow without the substance." <lb/>
The second mate catches a booby this afternoon, a <lb/>
bird which consists mainly of feathers; "but as <lb/>
they have no other meat, it will go well."</p>
<p>May 21, they strike the trades at last! The <lb/>
second mate catches three more boobies, and gives <lb/>
the long-boat one. Dinner "half a can of mince- <lb/>
meat divided up and served around, which strength- <lb/>
ened us somewhat." They have to keep a man <lb/>
bailing all the time; the hole knocked in the boat <lb/>
when she was launched from the burning ship was <lb/>
never efficiently mended. "Heading about north- <lb/>
west now." They hope they have easting enough <lb/>
to make some of those indefinite isles. Failing that, <lb/>
<pb n="30"/>
they think they will be in a better position to be <lb/>
picked up. It was an infinitely slender chance, but <lb/>
the captain probably refrained from mentioning <lb/>
that.</p>
<p>The next day is to be an eventful one.</p>
<q>May 22. Last night wind headed us off, so that part of the time we <lb/>
had to steer east-southeast and then west-northwest, and so on. This <lb/>
morning we were all startled by a cry of "<i>Sail ho!</i>" Sure enough we <lb/>
could see it! And for a time we cut adrift from the second mate's boat, <lb/>
and steered so as to attract its attention. This was about half-past five <lb/>
<smcap>a. m.</smcap> After sailing in a state of high excitement for almost twenty <lb/>
minutes we made it out to be the chief mate's boat. Of course we were <lb/>
glad to see them and have them report all well; but still it was a bitter <lb/>
disappointment to us all. Now that we are in the trades it seems im- <lb/>
possible to make northing enough to strike the isles. We have deter- <lb/>
mined to do the best we can, and get in the route of vessels. Such <lb/>
being the determination, it became necessary to cast off the other boat, <lb/>
which, after a good deal of unpleasantness, was done, we again dividing <lb/>
water and stores, and taking Cox into our boat. This makes our num- <lb/>
ber fifteen. The second mate's crew wanted to all get in with us and <lb/>
cast the other boat adrift. It was a very painful separation.</q>
<p>So those isles that they have struggled for so long <lb/>
and so hopefully have to be given up. What with <lb/>
lying birds that come to mock, and isles that are <lb/>
but a dream, and "visions of ships that come to <lb/>
naught," it is a pathetic time they are having, with <lb/>
much heartbreak in it. It was odd that the vanished <lb/>
boat, three days lost to sight in that vast solitude, <lb/>
should appear again. But it brought Cox&#x2014;we <lb/>
can't be certain why. But if it had n't, the diarist <lb/>
would never have seen the land again.</p>
<q>Our chances as we go west increase in regard to being picked up, but <lb/>
each day our scanty fare is so much reduced. Without the fish, turtle, <lb/>
<pb n="31"/>
and birds sent us, I do not know how we should have got along. The <lb/>
other day I offered to read prayers morning and evening for the captain, <lb/>
and last night commenced. The men, although of various nationalities <lb/>
and religions, are very attentive, and always uncovered. May God grant <lb/>
my weak endeavor its issue.</q>
<p>Latitude, May 24, 14&#x00B0; 18&#x2032; N. Five oysters apiece <lb/>
for dinner and three spoonfuls of juice, a gill of <lb/>
water, and a piece of biscuit the size of a silver dol- <lb/>
lar. "We are plainly getting weaker&#x2014;God have <lb/>
mercy upon us all!" That night heavy seas break <lb/>
over the weather side and make everybody wet and <lb/>
uncomfortable, besides requiring constant bailing. <lb/>
Next day "nothing particular happened." Perhaps <lb/>
some of us would have regarded it differently. <lb/>
"Passed a spar, but not near enough to see what it <lb/>
was." They saw some whales blow; there were fly- <lb/>
ing-fish skimming the seas, but none came aboard. <lb/>
Misty weather, with fine rain, very penetrating.</p>
<p>Latitude, May 26, 15&#x00B0; 50&#x2032;. They caught a flying- <lb/>
fish and a booby, but had to eat them raw. "The <lb/>
men grow weaker, and, I think, despondent; they <lb/>
say very little, though." And so, to all the other <lb/>
imaginable and unimaginable horrors, silence is <lb/>
added&#x2014;the muteness and brooding of coming <lb/>
despair. "It seems our best chance to get in the <lb/>
track of ships, with the hope that some one will run <lb/>
near enough to our speck to see it." He hopes <lb/>
the other boats stood west and have been picked up. <lb/>
(They will never be heard of again in this world.)</p>
<q>Sunday, May 27. Latitude 16&#x00B0; o&#x2032; 5&#x2033;; longitude, by chronometer, <lb/>
117&#x00B0; 22&#x2032;. Our fourth Sunday! When we left the ship we reckoned on <lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
having about ten days' supplies, and now we hope to be able, by rigid <lb/>
economy, to make them last another week if possible.<ref target="n1"><sup>*</sup></ref><note id="n1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>*</sup></seg><p>There are nineteen days of voyaging ahead yet.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> Last night the <lb/>
sea was comparatively quiet, but the wind headed us off to about west- <lb/>
northwest, which has been about our course all day to-day. Another <lb/>
flying-fish came aboard last night, and one more to-day&#x2014;both small <lb/>
ones. No birds. A booby is a great catch, and a good large one <lb/>
makes a small dinner for the fifteen of us&#x2014;that is, of course, as dinners <lb/>
go in the <i>Hornet's</i> long-boat. Tried this morning to read the full ser- <lb/>
vice to myself, with the communion, but found it too much; am too <lb/>
weak, and get sleepy, and cannot give strict attention; so I put off half <lb/>
till this afternoon. I trust God will hear the prayers gone up for us at <lb/>
home to-day, and graciously answer them by sending us succor and help <lb/>
in this our season of deep distress.</q>
<p>The next day was "a good day for seeing a <lb/>
ship." But none was seen. The diarist "still feels <lb/>
pretty well," though very weak; his brother Henry <lb/>
"bears up and keeps his strength the best of any on <lb/>
board." "I do not feel despondent at all, for I <lb/>
fully trust that the Almighty will hear our and the <lb/>
home prayers, and He who suffers not a sparrow to <lb/>
fall sees and cares for us, His creatures."</p>
<p>Considering the situation and circumstances, the <lb/>
record for next day, May 29, is one which has a <lb/>
surprise in it for those dull people who think that <lb/>
nothing but medicines and doctors can cure the sick. <lb/>
A little starvation can really do more for the average <lb/>
sick man than can the best medicines and the best <lb/>
doctors. I do not mean a restricted diet; I mean <lb/>
<i>total abstention from food for one or two days</i>. I <lb/>
speak from experience; starvation has been my cold <lb/>
and fever doctor for fifteen years, and has accom- <lb/>
<pb n="33"/>
plished a cure in all instances. The third mate told <lb/>
me in Honolulu that the "Portyghee" had lain in <lb/>
his hammock for months, raising his family of <lb/>
abscesses and feeding like a cannibal. We have <lb/>
seen that in spite of dreadful weather, deprivation <lb/>
of sleep, scorching, drenching, and all manner of <lb/>
miseries, thirteen days of starvation "wonderfully <lb/>
recovered" him. There were four sailors down <lb/>
sick when the ship was burned. Twenty-five days <lb/>
of pitiless starvation have followed, and now we <lb/>
have this curious record: "<i>All the men are hearty <lb/>
and strong; even the ones that were down sick are <lb/>
well</i>, except poor Peter." When I wrote an article <lb/>
some months ago urging temporary abstention from <lb/>
food as a remedy for an inactive appetite and for <lb/>
disease, I was accused of jesting, but I was in <lb/>
earnest. "<i>We are all wonderfully well and strong, <lb/>
comparatively speaking</i>." On this day the starva- <lb/>
tion regimen drew its belt a couple of buckle-holes <lb/>
tighter: the bread ration was reduced from the <lb/>
usual piece of cracker the size of a silver dollar <i>to <lb/>
the half of that, and one meal was abolished from <lb/>
the daily three</i>. This will weaken the men physically, <lb/>
but if there are any diseases of an ordinary sort left <lb/>
in them they will disappear.</p>
<q>Two quarts bread-crumbs left, one-third of a ham, three small cans of <lb/>
oysters, and twenty gallons of water.&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log</i>.</q>
<p>The hopeful tone of the diaries is persistent. It <lb/>
is remarkable. Look at the map and see where the <lb/>
boat is: latitude 16&#x00B0; 44&#x2032;, longitude 119&#x00B0; 20&#x2032;. It is <lb/>
<pb n="34"/>
more than two hundred miles west of the Revil- <lb/>
lagigedo Islands, so they are quite out of the ques- <lb/>
tion against the trades, rigged as this boat is. The <lb/>
nearest land available for such a boat is the American <lb/>
group, <i>six hundred and fifty miles away</i>, westward; <lb/>
still, there is no note of surrender, none even of dis- <lb/>
couragement! Yet, May 30, "we have now left: <lb/>
<i>one can of oysters; three pounds of raisins; one can <lb/>
of soup; one-third of a ham; three pints of biscuit- <lb/>
crumbs</i>." And fifteen starved men to live on it <lb/>
while they creep and crawl six hundred and fifty <lb/>
miles. "Somehow I feel much encouraged by this <lb/>
change of course (west by north) which we have <lb/>
made to-day." Six hundred and fifty miles on a <lb/>
hatful of provisions. Let us be thankful, even after <lb/>
thirty-two years, that they are mercifully ignorant of <lb/>
the fact that it isn't six hundred and fifty that they <lb/>
must creep on the hatful, but <i>twenty-two hundred!</i> <lb/>
Isn't the situation romantic enough just as it stands? <lb/>
No. Providence added a startling detail: pulling an <lb/>
oar in that boat, for common seaman's wages, was <lb/>
a <i>banished duke</i>&#x2014;Danish. We hear no more of <lb/>
him; just that mention, that is all, with the simple <lb/>
remark added that "he is one of our best men"&#x2014; <lb/>
a high enough compliment for a duke or any other <lb/>
man in those manhood-testing circumstances. With <lb/>
that little glimpse of him at his oar, and that fine <lb/>
word of praise, he vanishes out of our knowledge <lb/>
for all time. For all time, unless he should chance <lb/>
upon this note and reveal himself.</p>
<pb n="35"/>
<p>The last day of May is come. And now there is <lb/>
a disaster to report: think of it, reflect upon it, and <lb/>
try to understand how much it means, when you <lb/>
sit down with your family and pass your eye over <lb/>
your breakfast-table. Yesterday there were three <lb/>
pints of bread-crumbs; this morning the little bag is <lb/>
found open and <i>some of the crumbs missing</i>. "We <lb/>
dislike to suspect any one of such a rascally act, but <lb/>
there is no question that this grave crime has been <lb/>
committed. Two days will certainly finish the re- <lb/>
maining morsels. God grant us strength to reach <lb/>
the American group!" The third mate told me in <lb/>
Honolulu that in these days the men remembered <lb/>
with bitterness that the "Portyghee" had devoured <lb/>
twenty-two days' rations while he lay waiting to be <lb/>
transferred from the burning ship, and that now they <lb/>
cursed him and swore an oath that if it came to can- <lb/>
nibalism he should be the first to suffer for the rest.</p>
<q>The captain has lost his glasses, and therefore he cannot read our <lb/>
pocket prayer-books as much as I think he would like, though he is not <lb/>
familiar with them.</q>
<p>Further of the captain: "He is a good man, <lb/>
and has been most kind to us&#x2014;almost fatherly. <lb/>
He says that if he had been offered the command of <lb/>
the ship sooner he should have brought his two <lb/>
daughters with him." It makes one shudder yet to <lb/>
think how narrow an escape it was.</p>
<q>The two meals (rations) a day are as follows: fourteen raisins and a <lb/>
piece of cracker the size of a cent, for tea; a gill of water, and a piece <lb/>
of ham and a piece of bread, each the size of a cent, for breakfast.&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>Captain's Log</i>.</q>
<pb n="36"/>
<p>He means a cent in <i>thickness</i> as well as in circum- <lb/>
ference. Samuel Ferguson's diary says the ham <lb/>
was shaved "about as thin as it could be cut."</p>
<q>June 1. Last night and to-day sea very high and cobbling, breaking <lb/>
over and making us all wet and cold. Weather squally, and there is no <lb/>
doubt that only careful management&#x2014;with God's protecting care&#x2014; <lb/>
preserved us through both the night and the day; and really it is most <lb/>
marvelous how every morsel that passes our lips is blessed to us. It <lb/>
makes me think daily of the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Henry <lb/>
keeps up wonderfully, which is a great consolation to me. I somehow <lb/>
have great confidence, and hope that our afflictions will soon be ended, <lb/>
though we are running rapidly across the track of both outward and <lb/>
inward bound vessels, and away from them; our chief hope is a whaler, <lb/>
man-of-war, or some Australian ship. The isles we are steering for are <lb/>
put down in Bowditch, but on my map are said to be doubtful. God <lb/>
grant they may be there!</q>
<q>Hardest day yet.&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log</i>.</q>
<p><i>Doubtful!</i> It was worse than that. A week later <lb/>
<i>they sailed straight over them</i>.</p>
<q>June 2. Latitude 18&#x00B0; 9&#x2032;. Squally, cloudy, a heavy sea. &#x2026; I <lb/>
cannot help thinking of the cheerful and comfortable time we had <lb/>
aboard the <i>Hornet</i>.</q>
<q>Two days' scanty supplies left&#x2014;ten rations of water apiece and a <lb/>
little morsel of bread. <i>But the sun shines, and God is merciful.&#x2014;Cap- <lb/>
tain's Log</i>.</q>
<q>Sunday, June 3. Latitude 17&#x00B0; 54&#x2032;. Heavy sea all night, and from <lb/>
4 <smcap>a. m.</smcap> very wet, the sea breaking over us in frequent sluices, and soak- <lb/>
ing everything aft, particularly. All day the sea has been very high, <lb/>
and it is a wonder that we are not swamped. Heaven grant that it <lb/>
may go down this evening! Our suspense and condition are getting <lb/>
terrible. I managed this morning to crawl, more than step, to the <lb/>
forward end of the boat, and was surprised to find that I was so weak, <lb/>
especially in the legs and knees. The sun has been out again, and I <lb/>
have dried some things, and hope for a better night.</q>
<q>June 4. Latitude 17&#x00B0; 6&#x2032;, longitude 131&#x00B0; 30&#x2032;. Shipped hardly any <lb/>
seas last night, and to-day the sea has gone down somewhat, although <lb/>
<pb n="37"/>
it is still too high for comfort, as we have an occasional reminder that <lb/>
water is wet. The sun has been out all day, and so we have had a <lb/>
good drying. I have been trying for the last ten or twelve days to get <lb/>
a pair of drawers dry enough to put on, and to-day at last succeeded. <lb/>
I mention this to show the state in which we have lived. If our <lb/>
chronometer is anywhere near right, we ought to see the American <lb/>
Isles to-morrow or next day. If they are not there, we have only the <lb/>
chance for a few days, of a stray ship, for we cannot eke out the <lb/>
provisions more than five or six days longer, and our strength is failing <lb/>
very fast. I was much surprised to-day to note how my legs have wasted <lb/>
away above my knees: they are hardly thicker than my upper arm used <lb/>
to be. Still, I trust in God's infinite mercy, and feel sure he will do <lb/>
what is best for us. To survive, as we have done, thirty-two days in an <lb/>
open boat, with only about ten days' fair provisions for thirty-one men <lb/>
in the first place, and these divided twice subsequently, is more than <lb/>
mere unassisted <i>human</i> art and strength could have accomplished and <lb/>
endured.</q>
<q>Bread and raisins all gone.&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log.</i></q>
<q>Men growing dreadfully discontented, and awful grumbling and un- <lb/>
pleasant talk is arising. God save us from all strife of men; and if we <lb/>
must die now, take us himself, and not embitter our bitter death still <lb/>
more.&#x2014;<i>Henry's Log.</i></q>
<q>June 5. Quiet night and pretty comfortable day, though our sail and <lb/>
block show signs of failing, and need taking down&#x2014;which latter is <lb/>
something of a job, as it requires the climbing of the mast. We also <lb/>
had news from forward, there being discontent and some threatening <lb/>
complaints of unfair allowances, etc., all as unreasonable as foolish; still, <lb/>
these things bid us be on our guard. I am getting miserably weak, but <lb/>
try to keep up the best I can. If we cannot find those isles we can only <lb/>
try to make northwest and get in the track of Sandwich Island bound <lb/>
vessels, living as best we can in the meantime. To-day we changed to <lb/>
one meal, and that at about noon, with a small ration of water at 8 or 9 <lb/>
<smcap>a. m.</smcap>, another at 12 <smcap>m.</smcap>, and a third at 5 or 6 <smcap>p. m.</smcap></q>
<q>Nothing left but a little piece of ham and a gill of water, all around. <lb/>
&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log</i>.</q>
<p>They are down to <i>one</i> meal a day now,&#x2014;such as <lb/>
it is,&#x2014;and <i>fifteen hundred miles to crawl yet!</i> And <lb/>
now the horrors deepen, and though they escaped <lb/>
<pb n="38"/>
actual mutiny, the attitude of the men became <lb/>
alarming. Now we seem to see why that curious <lb/>
accident happened, so long ago: I mean Cox's re- <lb/>
turn, after he had been far away and out of sight <lb/>
several days in the chief mate's boat. If he had <lb/>
not come back the captain and the two young pas- <lb/>
sengers would have been slain by these sailors, who <lb/>
were becoming crazed through their sufferings.</p>
<q><smcap>note secretly passed by henry to his brother</smcap>.</q>
<q>Cox told me last night that there is getting to be a good deal of <lb/>
ugly talk among the men against the captain and us aft. They say that <lb/>
the captain is the cause of all; that he did not try to save the ship at <lb/>
all, nor to get provisions, and even would not let the men put in some <lb/>
they had; and that partiality is shown us in apportioning our rations aft. <lb/>
* * * asked Cox the other day if he would starve first or eat human <lb/>
flesh. Cox answered he would starve. * * * then told him he would be <lb/>
only killing himself. If we do not find these islands we would do well <lb/>
to prepare for anything. * * * is the loudest of all.</q>
<q><smcap>reply</smcap>.</q>
<q>We can depend on * * *, I think, and * * *, and Cox, can we not?</q>
<q><smcap>second note</smcap>.</q>
<q>I guess so, and very likely on * * *; but there is no telling. * * * <lb/>
and Cox are certain. There is nothing definite said or hinted as yet, as I <lb/>
understand Cox; but starving men are the same as maniacs. It would be <lb/>
well to keep a watch on your pistol, so as to have it and the cartridges <lb/>
safe from theft.</q>
<q><i>Henry's Log</i>, June 5. Dreadful forebodings. God spare us from all <lb/>
such horrors! Some of the men getting to talk a good deal. Nothing <lb/>
to write down. Heart very sad.</q>
<q><i>Henry's Log</i>, June 6. Passed some seaweed, and something that <lb/>
looked like the trunk of an old tree, but no birds; beginning to be afraid <lb/>
islands not there. To-day it was said to the captain, in the hearing of <lb/>
all, that some of the men would not shrink, when a man was dead, from <lb/>
<pb n="39"/>
using the flesh, though they would not kill. Horrible! God give us all <lb/>
full use of our reason, and spare us from such things! "From plague, <lb/>
pestilence, and famine, from battle and murder, and from sudden death, <lb/>
good Lord, deliver us!"</q>
<q>June 6. Latitude 16&#x00B0; 30&#x2032;, longitude (chron.) 134&#x00B0;. Dry night and <lb/>
wind steady enough to require no change in sail; but this <smcap>a. m.</smcap> an at- <lb/>
tempt to lower it proved abortive. First the third mate tried and got up <lb/>
to the block, and fastened a temporary arrangement to reeve the hal- <lb/>
yards through, but had to come down, weak and almost fainting, before <lb/>
finishing; then Joe tried, and after twice ascending, fixed it and brought <lb/>
down the block; but it was very exhausting work, and afterward he was <lb/>
good for nothing all day. The clue-iron which we are trying to make <lb/>
serve for the broken block works, however, very indifferently, and will, <lb/>
I am afraid, soon cut the rope. It is very necessary to get everything <lb/>
connected with the sail in good, easy running order before we get too <lb/>
weak to do anything with it.</q>
<q>Only three meals left.&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log</i>.</q>
<q>June 7. Latitude 16&#x00B0; 35&#x2032; N., longitude 136&#x00B0; 30&#x2032; W. Night wet <lb/>
and uncomfortable. To-day shows us pretty conclusively that the <lb/>
American Isles are not there, though we have had some signs that <lb/>
looked like them. At noon we decided to abandon looking any farther <lb/>
for them, and to-night haul a little more northerly, so as to get in the <lb/>
way of Sandwich Island vessels, which fortunately come down pretty well <lb/>
this way&#x2014;say to latitude 19&#x00B0; to 20&#x00B0;&#x2014;to get the benefit of the trade <lb/>
winds. Of course all the westing we have made is gain, and I hope the <lb/>
chronometer is wrong in our favor, for I do not see how any such delicate <lb/>
instrument can keep good time with the constant jarring and thumping <lb/>
we get from the sea. With the strong trade we have, I hope that a <lb/>
week from Sunday will put us in sight of the Sandwich Islands, if we <lb/>
are not safe by that time by being picked up.</q>
<p>It is twelve hundred miles to the Sandwich <lb/>
Islands; the provisions are virtually exhausted, but <lb/>
not the perishing diarist's pluck.</p>
<q>June 8. My cough troubled me a good deal last night, and therefore <lb/>
I got hardly any sleep at all. Still, I make out pretty well, and should <lb/>
not complain. Yesterday the third mate mended the block, and this <lb/>
<smcap>p. m.</smcap> the sail, after some difficulty, was got down, and Harry got to the <lb/>
<pb n="40"/>
top of the mast and rove the halyards through after some hardship, so <lb/>
that it now works easy and well. This getting up the mast is no easy <lb/>
matter at any time with the sea we have, and is very exhausting in our <lb/>
present state. We could only reward Harry by an extra ration of <lb/>
water. We have made good time and course to-day. Heading her up, <lb/>
however, makes the boat ship seas and keeps us all wet; however, it <lb/>
cannot be helped. Writing is a rather precarious thing these times. Our <lb/>
meal to-day for the fifteen consists of half a can of "soup and boullie"; <lb/>
the other half is reserved for to-morrow. Henry still keeps up grandly, <lb/>
and is a great favorite. God grant he may be spared!</q>
<q>A better feeling prevails among the men.&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log</i>.</q>
<q>June 9. Latitude 17&#x00B0; 53&#x2032;. Finished to-day, I may say, our whole <lb/>
stock of provisions.<ref target="n2"><sup>*</sup></ref><note id="n2" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>*</sup></seg><p>Six days to sail yet, nevertheless.&#x2014;M. T.</p></note> We have only left a lower end of a ham-bone, <lb/>
with some of the outer rind and skin on. In regard to the water, how- <lb/>
ever, I think we have got ten days' supply at our present rate of allow- <lb/>
ance. This, with what nourishment we can get from boot-legs and such <lb/>
chewable matter, we hope will enable us to weather it out till we get to <lb/>
the Sandwich Islands, or, sailing in the meantime in the track of vessels <lb/>
thither bound, be picked up. My hope is in the latter, for in all human <lb/>
probability I cannot stand the other. Still, we have been marvelously <lb/>
protected, and God, I hope, will preserve us all in his own good time <lb/>
and way. The men are getting weaker, but are still quiet and orderly.</q>
<q>Sunday, June 10. Latitude 18&#x00B0; 40&#x2032;, longitude 142&#x00B0; 34&#x2032;. A pretty <lb/>
good night last night, with some wettings, and again another beautiful <lb/>
Sunday. I cannot but think how we should all enjoy it at home, and <lb/>
what a contrast is here! How terrible their suspense must begin to be! <lb/>
God grant that it may be relieved before very long, and he certainly <lb/>
seems to be with us in everything we do, and has preserved this boat <lb/>
miraculously; for since we left the ship we have sailed considerably over <lb/>
three thousand miles, which, taking into consideration our meager stock <lb/>
of provisions, is almost unprecedented. As yet I do not feel the stint <lb/>
of food so much as I do that of water. Even Henry, who is naturally <lb/>
a good water-drinker, can save half of his allowance from time to time, <lb/>
when I cannot. My diseased throat may have something to do with <lb/>
that, however.</q>
<p>Nothing is now left which by any flattery can be <lb/>
called food. But they must manage somehow for <lb/>
<pb n="41"/>
five days more, for at noon they have still eight <lb/>
hundred miles to go. It is a race for life now.</p>
<p>This is no time for comments or other interrup- <lb/>
tions from me&#x2014;every moment is valuable. I will <lb/>
take up the boy brother's diary at this point, and <lb/>
clear the seas before it and let it fly.</p>
<q><smcap>henry ferguson's log</smcap>.</q>
<q>Sunday, June 10. Our ham-bone has given us a taste of food to-day, <lb/>
and we have got left a little meat and the remainder of the bone for to- <lb/>
morrow. Certainly never was there such a sweet knuckle-bone, or one <lb/>
that was so thoroughly appreciated&#x2026;.. I do not know that I feel <lb/>
any worse than I did last Sunday, notwithstanding the reduction of diet; <lb/>
and I trust that we may all have strength given us to sustain the suffer- <lb/>
ings and hardships of the coming week. We estimate that we are within <lb/>
seven hundred miles of the Sandwich Islands, and that our average, <lb/>
daily, is somewhat over a hundred miles, so that our hopes have some <lb/>
foundation in reason. Heaven send we may all live to see land!</q>
<q>June 11. Ate the meat and rind of our ham-bone, and have the bone <lb/>
and the greasy cloth from around the ham left to eat to-morrow. God <lb/>
send us birds or fish, and let us not perish of hunger, or be brought to <lb/>
the dreadful alternative of feeding on human flesh! As I feel now, I do <lb/>
not think anything could persuade me; but you cannot tell what you <lb/>
will do when you are reduced by hunger and your mind wandering. I <lb/>
hope and pray we can make out to reach the islands before we get to <lb/>
this strait; but we have one or two desperate men aboard, though they <lb/>
are quiet enough now. <i>It is my firm trust and belief that we are going <lb/>
to be saved</i>.</q>
<q>All food gone.&#x2014;<i>Captain's Log</i>.<ref target="n3"><sup>*</sup></ref><note id="n3" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><sup>*</sup></seg><p>It was at this time discovered that the crazed sailors had gotten the <lb/>

<q>June 12. Stiff breeze, and we are fairly flying&#x2014;dead ahead of it&#x2014; <lb/>
and toward the islands. Good hope, but the prospects of hunger are <lb/>
awful. Ate ham-bone to-day. It is the captain's birthday; he is fifty- <lb/>
four years old.</q>
<pb n="42"/>
<q>June 13. The ham-rags are not quite all gone yet, and the boot- <lb/>
legs, we find, are very palatable after we get the salt out of them. A <lb/>
little smoke, I think, does some little good; but I don't know.</q>
<q>June 14. Hunger does not pain us much, but we are dreadfully <lb/>
weak. Our water is getting frightfully low. God grant we may see <lb/>
land soon! <i>Nothing to eat</i>, but feel better than I did yesterday. <lb/>
Toward evening saw a magnificent rainbow&#x2014;<i>the first we had seen</i>. <lb/>
Captain said, "Cheer up, boys; it's a prophecy&#x2014;<i>it's the bow of <lb/>
promise!"</i></q>
<q>June 15. God be forever praised for his infinite mercy! LAND IN <lb/>
SIGHT! Rapidly neared it and soon were <i>sure</i> of it&#x2026;. Two <lb/>
noble Kanakas swam out and took the boat ashore. We were joyfully <lb/>
received by two white men&#x2014;Mr. Jones and his steward Charley&#x2014;and <lb/>
a crowd of native men, women, and children. They treated us splen- <lb/>
didly&#x2014;aided us, and carried us up the bank, and brought us water, <lb/>
poi, bananas, and green cocoanuts; but the white men took care of us <lb/>
and prevented those who would have eaten too much from doing so. <lb/>
Everybody overjoyed to see us, and all sympathy expressed in faces, <lb/>
deeds, and words. We were then helped up to the house; and help <lb/>
we needed. Mr. Jones and Charley are the only white men here. <lb/>
Treated us splendidly. Gave us first about a teaspoonful of spirits in <lb/>
water, and then to each a cup of warm tea, with a little bread. Takes <lb/>
<i>every</i> care of us. Gave us later another cup of tea, and bread the same, <lb/>
and then let us go to rest. <i>It is the happiest day of my life</i>&#x2026;. God <lb/>
in his mercy has heard our prayer&#x2026;. Everybody is so kind. Words <lb/>
cannot tell.</q>
<q>June 16. Mr. Jones gave us a delightful bed, and we surely had a <lb/>
good night's rest; but not sleep&#x2014;we were too happy to sleep; would <lb/>
keep the reality and not let it turn to a delusion&#x2014;dreaded that we <lb/>
might wake up and find ourselves in the boat again.</q>
<p>It is an amazing adventure. There is nothing of <lb/>
its sort in history that surpasses it in impossibilities <lb/>
made possible. In one extraordinary detail&#x2014;the <lb/>
survival of <i>every person</i> in the boat&#x2014;it probably <lb/>
stands alone in the history of adventures of its kind. <lb/>
Usually merely a part of a boat's company survive <lb/>
<pb n="43"/>
&#x2014;officers, mainly, and other educated and tenderly <lb/>
reared men, unused to hardship and heavy labor; <lb/>
the untrained, roughly reared hard workers suc- <lb/>
cumb. But in this case even the rudest and rough- <lb/>
est stood the privations and miseries of the voyage <lb/>
almost as well as did the college-bred young brothers <lb/>
and the captain. I mean, physically. The minds <lb/>
of most of the sailors broke down in the fourth week <lb/>
and went to temporary ruin, but physically the en- <lb/>
durance exhibited was astonishing. Those men did <lb/>
not survive by any merit of their own, of course, <lb/>
but by merit of the character and intelligence of the <lb/>
captain; they lived by the mastery of his spirit. <lb/>
Without him they would have been children without <lb/>
a nurse; they would have exhausted their provisions <lb/>
in a week, and their pluck would not have lasted <lb/>
even as long as the provisions.</p>
<p>The boat came near to being wrecked at the last. <lb/>
As it approached the shore the sail was let go, and <lb/>
came down with a run; then the captain saw that he <lb/>
was drifting swiftly toward an ugly reef, and an <lb/>
effort was made to hoist the sail again: but it could <lb/>
not be done; the men's strength was wholly ex- <lb/>
hausted; they could not even pull an oar. They <lb/>
were helpless, and death imminent. It was then <lb/>
that they were discovered by the two Kanakas who <lb/>
achieved the rescue. They swam out and manned <lb/>
the boat and piloted her through a narrow and <lb/>
hardly noticeable break in the reef&#x2014;the only break <lb/>
in it in a stretch of thirty-five miles! The spot <lb/>
<pb n="44"/>
where the landing was made was the only one in <lb/>
that stretch where footing could have been found on <lb/>
the shore; everywhere else precipices came sheer <lb/>
down into forty fathoms of water. Also, in all that <lb/>
stretch this was the only spot where anybody lived.</p>
<p>Within ten days after the landing all the men but <lb/>
one were up and creeping about. Properly, they <lb/>
ought to have killed themselves with the "food" of <lb/>
the last few days&#x2014;some of them, at any rate&#x2014; <lb/>
men who had freighted their stomachs with strips of <lb/>
leather from old boots and with chips from the <lb/>
butter-cask; a freightage which they did not get rid <lb/>
of by digestion, but by other means. The captain <lb/>
and the two passengers did not eat strips and chips, <lb/>
as the sailors did, but <i>scraped</i> the boot-leather and <lb/>
the wood, and made a pulp of the scrapings by <lb/>
moistening them with water. The third mate told <lb/>
me that the boots were old and full of holes; then <lb/>
added thoughtfully, "but the holes digested the <lb/>
best." Speaking of digestion, here is a remarkable <lb/>
thing, and worth noting: during this strange voyage, <lb/>
and for a while afterward on shore, the bowels of <lb/>
some of the men virtually ceased from their func- <lb/>
tions; in some cases there was no action for twenty <lb/>
and thirty days, and in one case for forty-four! <lb/>
Sleeping also came to be rare. Yet the men did <lb/>
very well without it. During many days the captain <lb/>
did not sleep at all&#x2014;twenty-one, I think, on one <lb/>
stretch.</p>
<p>When the landing was made, all the men were <lb/>
<pb n="45"/>
successfully protected from overeating except the <lb/>
"Portyghee"; he escaped the watch and ate an in- <lb/>
credible number of bananas: a hundred and fifty- <lb/>
two, the third mate said, but this was undoubtedly <lb/>
an exaggeration; I think it was a hundred and <lb/>
fifty-one. He was already nearly full of leather; <lb/>
it was hanging out of his ears. (I do not state this <lb/>
on the third mate's authority, for we have seen what <lb/>
sort of person he was; I state it on my own.) <lb/>
The "Portyghee" ought to have died, of course, <lb/>
and even now it seems a pity that he did n't; but he <lb/>
got well, and as early as any of them; and all full of <lb/>
leather, too, the way he was, and butter-timber and <lb/>
handkerchiefs and bananas. Some of the men did <lb/>
eat handkerchiefs in those last days, also socks; <lb/>
and he was one of them.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of the men that they did not kill <lb/>
the rooster that crowed so gallantly mornings. He <lb/>
lived eighteen days, and then stood up and <lb/>
stretched his neck and made a brave, weak effort <lb/>
to do his duty once more, and died in the act. It <lb/>
is a picturesque detail; and so is that rainbow, too, <lb/>
&#x2014;the only one seen in the forty-three days,&#x2014;rais- <lb/>
ing its triumphal arch in the skies for the sturdy <lb/>
fighters to sail under to victory and rescue.</p>
<p>With ten days' provisions Captain Josiah Mitchell <lb/>
performed this memorable voyage of forty-three <lb/>
days and eight hours in an open boat, sailing four <lb/>
thousand miles in reality and thirty-three hundred <lb/>
and sixty by direct courses, and brought every man <lb/>
<pb n="46"/>
safe to land. A bright, simple-hearted, unassuming, <lb/>
plucky, and most companionable man. I walked <lb/>
the deck with him twenty-eight days,&#x2014;when I was <lb/>
not copying diaries,&#x2014;and I remember him with <lb/>
reverent honor. If he is alive he is eighty-six years <lb/>
old now.</p>
<p>If I remember rightly, Samuel Ferguson died <lb/>
soon after we reached San Francisco. I do not <lb/>
think he lived to see his home again; his disease <lb/>
had been seriously aggravated by his hardships.</p>
<p>For a time it was hoped that the two quarter-boats <lb/>
would presently be heard of, but this hope suffered <lb/>
disappointment. They went down with all on board, <lb/>
no doubt, not even sparing that knightly chief <lb/>
mate.</p>
<p>The authors of the diaries allowed me to copy <lb/>
them exactly as they were written, and the extracts <lb/>
that I have given are without any smoothing over <lb/>
or revision. These diaries are finely modest and <lb/>
unaffected, and with unconscious and unintentional <lb/>
art they rise toward the climax with graduated and <lb/>
gathering force and swing and dramatic intensity; <lb/>
they sweep you along with a cumulative rush, and <lb/>
when the cry rings out at last, "Land in sight!" <lb/>
your heart is in your mouth, and for a moment you <lb/>
think it is you that have been saved. The last two <lb/>
paragraphs are not improvable by anybody's art; <lb/>
they are literary gold; and their very pauses and <lb/>
uncompleted sentences have in them an eloquence <lb/>
not reachable by any words.</p>
<pb n="47"/>
<p>The interest of this story is unquenchable; it is <lb/>
of the sort that time cannot decay. I have not <lb/>
looked at the diaries for thirty-two years, but I find <lb/>
that they have lost nothing in that time. Lost? <lb/>
They have gained; for by some subtle law all tragic <lb/>
human experiences gain in pathos by the perspec- <lb/>
tive of time. We realize this when in Naples we <lb/>
stand musing over the poor Pompeian mother, lost in <lb/>
the historic storm of volcanic ashes eighteen centu- <lb/>
ries ago, who lies with her child gripped close to her <lb/>
breast, trying to save it, and whose despair and grief <lb/>
have been preserved for us by the fiery envelope <lb/>
which took her life but eternalized her form and <lb/>
features. She moves us, she haunts us, she stays <lb/>
in our thoughts for many days, we do not know <lb/>
why, for she is nothing to us, she has been nothing <lb/>
to any one for eighteen centuries; whereas of the <lb/>
like case to-day we should say, "Poor thing! it is <lb/>
pitiful," and forget it in an hour.</p>

<p>"<smcap>Yes, i</smcap> will tell you anything about my life that <lb/>

<p>She had been absently scraping blubber-grease <lb/>

<p>air, with her cumbersome and shapeless fur coat and <lb/>
trousers and boots and vast hood, the beauty of her <lb/>
face at least was apparent; but her figure had to be <lb/>
taken on trust. Among all the guests who came <lb/>
and went, I had seen no girl at her father's hospi- <lb/>
table trough who could be called her equal. Yet she <lb/>
was not spoiled. She was sweet and natural and <lb/>
sincere, and if she was aware that she was a belle, <lb/>
there was nothing about her ways to show that she <lb/>
possessed that knowledge.</p>
<p>She had been my daily comrade for a week now, <lb/>
and the better I knew her the better I liked her. <lb/>
She had been tenderly and carefully brought up, <lb/>
in an atmosphere of singularly rare refinement for <lb/>
the polar regions, for her father was the most im- <lb/>
portant man of his tribe and ranked at the top of <lb/>
Esquimau cultivation. I made long dog-sledge trips <lb/>
across the mighty ice floes with Lasca,&#x2014;that was <lb/>
her name,&#x2014;and found her company always pleasant <lb/>
and her conversation agreeable. I went fishing with <lb/>
her, but not in her perilous boat: I merely followed <lb/>
along on the ice and watched her strike her game <lb/>
with her fatally accurate spear. We went sealing <lb/>
together; several times I stood by while she and the <lb/>
family dug blubber from a stranded whale, and once <lb/>
I went part of the way when she was hunting a bear, <lb/>
but turned back before the finish, because at bottom <lb/>
I am afraid of bears.</p>
<p>However, she was ready to begin her story now, <lb/>
and this is what she said:</p>
<pb n="50"/>
<p>"Our tribe had always been used to wander about <lb/>
from place to place over the frozen seas, like the <lb/>
other tribes, but my father got tired of that two <lb/>
years ago, and built this great mansion of frozen <lb/>
snow-blocks,&#x2014;look at it; it is seven feet high and <lb/>
three or four times as long as any of the others,&#x2014; <lb/>
and here we have stayed ever since. He was very <lb/>
proud of his house, and that was reasonable; for if <lb/>
you have examined it with care you must have <lb/>
noticed how much finer and completer it is than <lb/>
houses usually are. But if you have not, you must, <lb/>
for you will find it has luxurious appointments that <lb/>
are quite beyond the common. For instance, in <lb/>
that end of it which you have called the 'parlor,' <lb/>
the raised platform for the accommodation of guests <lb/>
and the family at meals is the largest you have ever <lb/>
seen in any house&#x2014;is it not so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you are quite right, Lasca; it is the <lb/>
largest; we have nothing resembling it in even the <lb/>
finest houses in the United States." This admis- <lb/>
sion made her eyes sparkle with pride and pleasure. <lb/>
I noted that, and took my cue.</p>
<p>"I thought it must have surprised you," she said. <lb/>
"And another thing: it is bedded far deeper in furs <lb/>
than is usual; all kinds of furs&#x2014;seal, sea-otter, <lb/>
silver-gray fox, bear, marten, sable&#x2014;every kind of <lb/>
fur in profusion; and the same with the ice-block <lb/>
sleeping-benches along the walls, which you call <lb/>
'beds.' Are your platforms and sleeping-benches <lb/>
better provided at home?"</p>
<pb n="51"/>
<p>"Indeed, they are not, Lasca&#x2014;they do not <lb/>
begin to be." That pleased her again. All she was <lb/>
thinking of was the <i>number</i> of furs her &#x00E6;sthetic <lb/>
father took the trouble to keep on hand, not their <lb/>
value. I could have told her that those masses of <lb/>
rich furs constituted wealth,&#x2014;or would in my coun- <lb/>
try,&#x2014;but she would not have understood that; those <lb/>
were not the kind of things that ranked as riches <lb/>
with her people. I could have told her that the <lb/>
clothes she had on, or the every-day clothes of the <lb/>
commonest person about her, were worth twelve or <lb/>
fifteen hundred dollars, and that I was not acquainted <lb/>
with anybody at home who wore twelve-hundred-dol- <lb/>
lar toilets to go fishing in; but she would not have <lb/>
understood it, so I said nothing. She resumed:</p>
<p>"And then the slop-tubs. We have two in the <lb/>
parlor, and two in the rest of the house. It is very <lb/>
seldom that one has two in the parlor. Have you <lb/>
two in the parlor at home?"</p>
<p>The memory of those tubs made me gasp, but I <lb/>
recovered myself before she noticed, and said with <lb/>
effusion:</p>
<p>"Why, Lasca, it is a shame of me to expose my <lb/>
country, and you must not let it go further, for I <lb/>
am speaking to you in confidence; but I give you <lb/>
my word of honor that not even the richest man in <lb/>
the city of New York has two slop-tubs in his draw- <lb/>
ing-room."</p>
<p>She clapped her fur-clad hands in innocent de- <lb/>
light, and exclaimed:</p>
<pb n="52"/>
<p>"Oh, but you cannot mean it, you cannot <i>mean</i> <lb/>
it!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I am in earnest, dear. There is Van- <lb/>
derbilt. Vanderbilt is almost the richest man in the <lb/>
whole world. Now, if I were on my dying bed, I <lb/>
could say to you that not even he has two in his <lb/>
drawing-room. Why, he hasn't even <i>one</i>&#x2014;I wish <lb/>
I may die in my tracks if it isn't true."</p>
<p>Her lovely eyes stood wide with amazement, and <lb/>
she said, slowly, and with a sort of awe in her voice:</p>
<p>"How strange&#x2014;how incredible&#x2014;one is not able <lb/>
to realize it. Is he penurious?"</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;it isn't that. It isn't the expense he <lb/>
minds, but&#x2014;er&#x2014;well, you know, it would look <lb/>
like showing off. Yes, that is it, that is the idea; <lb/>
he is a plain man in his way, and shrinks from <lb/>
display."</p>
<p>"Why, that humility is right enough," said <lb/>
Lasca, "if one does not carry it too far&#x2014;but what <lb/>
does the place <i>look</i> like?"</p>
<p>"Well, necessarily it looks pretty barren and un- <lb/>
finished, but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I should think so! I never heard anything like <lb/>
it. Is it a fine house&#x2014;that is, otherwise?"</p>
<p>"Pretty fine, yes. It is very well thought of."</p>
<p>The girl was silent awhile, and sat dreamily gnaw- <lb/>
ing a candle-end, apparently trying to think the thing <lb/>
out. At last she gave her head a little toss and <lb/>
spoke out her opinion with decision:</p>
<p>"Well, to my mind there's a breed of humility <lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
which is <i>itself</i> a species of showing-off, when you <lb/>
get down to the marrow of it; and when a man is <lb/>
able to afford two slop-tubs in his parlor, and don't <lb/>
do it, it <i>may</i> be that he is truly humble-minded, but <lb/>
it's a hundred times more likely that he is just trying <lb/>
to strike the public eye. In my judgment, your <lb/>
Mr. Vanderbilt knows what he is about."</p>
<p>I tried to modify this verdict, feeling that a double <lb/>
slop-tub standard was not a fair one to try every- <lb/>
body by, although a sound enough one in its own <lb/>
habitat; but the girl's head was set, and she was not <lb/>
to be persuaded. Presently she said:</p>
<p>"Do the rich people, with you, have as good <lb/>
sleeping-benches as ours, and made out of as nice <lb/>
broad ice-blocks?"</p>
<p>"Well, they are pretty good&#x2014;good enough&#x2014; <lb/>
but they are not made of ice-blocks."</p>
<p>"I want to know! <i>Why</i> aren't they made of ice- <lb/>
blocks?"</p>
<p>I explained the difficulties in the way, and the ex- <lb/>
pensiveness of ice in a country where you have to <lb/>
keep a sharp eye on your ice man or your ice bill <lb/>
will weigh more than your ice. Then she cried out:</p>
<p>"Dear me, do you <i>buy</i> your ice?"</p>
<p>"We most surely do, dear."</p>
<p>She burst into a gale of guileless laughter, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, I <i>never</i> heard of anything so silly! My, <lb/>
there's plenty of it&#x2014;it isn't worth anything. Why, <lb/>
there is a hundred miles of it in sight, right now. I <lb/>
wouldn't give a fish bladder for the whole of it."</p>
<pb n="54"/>
<p>"Well, it's because you don't know how to value <lb/>
it, you little provincial muggins. If you had it in <lb/>
New York in midsummer, you could buy all the <lb/>
whales in the market with it."</p>
<p>She looked at me doubtfully, and said:</p>
<p>"Are you speaking true?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I take my oath to it."</p>
<p>This made her thoughtful. Presently she said, <lb/>
with a little sigh:</p>
<p>"I wish <i>I</i> could live there."</p>
<p>I had merely meant to furnish her a standard of <lb/>
values which she could understand; but my pur- <lb/>
pose had miscarried. I had only given her the im- <lb/>
pression that whales were cheap and plenty in New <lb/>
York, and set her mouth to watering for them. It <lb/>
seemed best to try to mitigate the evil which I had <lb/>
done, so I said:</p>
<p>"But you wouldn't care for whale meat if you <lb/>
lived there. Nobody does."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Indeed they don't."</p>
<p>"<i>Why</i> don't they?"</p>
<p>"Wel-l-l, I hardly know. It's prejudice, I think. <lb/>
Yes, that is it&#x2014;just prejudice. I reckon some- <lb/>
body that hadn't anything better to do started a pre- <lb/>
judice against it, some time or other, and once you <lb/>
get a caprice like that fairly going, you know, it will <lb/>
last no end of time."</p>
<p>"That is true&#x2014;<i>perfectly</i> true," said the girl, <lb/>
reflectively. "Like our prejudice against soap, here <lb/>
<pb n="55"/>
&#x2014;our tribes had a prejudice against soap at first, <lb/>
you know."</p>
<p>I glanced at her to see if she was in earnest. Evi- <lb/>
dently she was. I hesitated, then said, cautiously:</p>
<p>"But pardon me. They <i>had</i> a prejudice against <lb/>
soap? Had?"&#x2014;with falling inflection.</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;but that was only at first; nobody would <lb/>
eat it."</p>
<p>"Oh,&#x2014;I understand. I didn't get your idea <lb/>
before."</p>
<p>She resumed:</p>
<p>"It was just a prejudice. The first time soap came <lb/>
here from the foreigners, nobody liked it; but as <lb/>
soon as it got to be fashionable, everybody liked it, <lb/>
and now everybody has it that can afford it. Are <lb/>
you fond of it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed! I should die if I couldn't have it <lb/>
&#x2014;especially here. Do you like it?"</p>
<p>"I just <foreign lang="fre"><i>adore</i></foreign> it! Do you like candles?"</p>
<p>"I regard them as an absolute necessity. Are <lb/>
you fond of them?"</p>
<p>Her eyes fairly danced, and she exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Oh! Don't mention it! Candles!&#x2014;and <lb/>
soap!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And fish-interiors!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And train-oil!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And slush!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And whale-blubber!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And carrion! and sour-krout! and beeswax! <lb/>
and tar! and turpentine! and molasses! and&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="56"/>
<p>"Don't&#x2014;oh, don't&#x2014;I shall expire with <lb/>
ecstasy!&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And then serve it all up in a slush-bucket, and <lb/>
invite the neighbors and sail in!"</p>
<p>But this vision of an ideal feast was too much for <lb/>
her, and she swooned away, poor thing. I rubbed <lb/>
snow in her face and brought her to, and after a <lb/>
while got her excitement cooled down. By and by <lb/>
she drifted into her story again:</p>
<p>"So we began to live here, in the fine house. <lb/>
But I was not happy. The reason was this: I was <lb/>
born for love; for me there could be no true happi- <lb/>
ness without it. I wanted to be loved for myself <lb/>
alone. I wanted an idol, and I wanted to be my <lb/>
idol's idol; nothing less than mutual idolatry would <lb/>
satisfy my fervent nature. I had suitors in plenty <lb/>
&#x2014;in over-plenty, indeed&#x2014;but in each and every <lb/>
case they had a fatal defect; sooner or later I dis- <lb/>
covered that defect&#x2014;not one of them failed to be- <lb/>
tray it&#x2014;it was not me they wanted, but my wealth."</p>
<p>"Your wealth?"</p>
<p>"Yes; for my father is much the richest man in <lb/>
this tribe&#x2014;or in any tribe in these regions."</p>
<p>I wondered what her father's wealth consisted of. <lb/>
It couldn't be the house&#x2014;anybody could build <lb/>
its mate. It couldn't be the furs&#x2014;they were not <lb/>
valued. It couldn't be the sledge, the dogs, the <lb/>
harpoons, the boat, the bone fish-hooks and needles, <lb/>
and such things&#x2014;no, these were not wealth. Then <lb/>
what could it be that made this man so rich and <lb/>
<pb n="57"/>
brought this swarm of sordid suitors to his house? <lb/>
It seemed to me, finally, that the best way to find <lb/>
out would be to ask. So I did it. The girl was so <lb/>
manifestly gratified by the question that I saw she <lb/>
had been aching to have me ask it. She was suffer- <lb/>
ing fully as much to tell as I was to know. She <lb/>
snuggled confidentially up to me and said:</p>
<p>"Guess how much he is worth&#x2014;you never can!"</p>
<p>I pretended to consider the matter deeply, she <lb/>
watching my anxious and laboring countenance <lb/>
with a devouring and delighted interest; and when, <lb/>
at last, I gave it up and begged her to appease my <lb/>
longing by telling me herself how much this polar <lb/>
Vanderbilt was worth, she put her mouth close to <lb/>
my ear and whispered, impressively:</p>
<p>"<i>Twenty-two fish-hooks</i>&#x2014;not bone, but foreign <lb/>
&#x2014;<i>made out of real iron!</i>"</p>
<p>Then she sprang back dramatically, to observe the <lb/>
effect. I did my level best not to disappoint her.</p>
<p>I turned pale and murmured:</p>
<p>"Great Scott!"</p>
<p>"It's as true as you live, Mr. Twain!"</p>
<p>"Lasca, you are deceiving me&#x2014;you cannot mean <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>She was frightened and troubled. She exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Mr. Twain, every word of it is true&#x2014;every <lb/>
word. You believe me&#x2014;you <i>do</i> believe me, now <lb/>
<i>don't</i> you? <i>Say</i> you believe me&#x2014;<i>do</i> say you be- <lb/>
lieve me!"</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;well, yes, I do&#x2014;I am <i>trying</i> to. But it <lb/>
<pb n="58"/>
was all so <i>sudden</i>. So sudden and prostrating. <lb/>
You shouldn't do such a thing in that sudden way. <lb/>
It&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm <i>so</i> sorry! If I had only thought&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Well, it's all right, and I don't blame you any <lb/>
more, for you are young and thoughtless, and of <lb/>
course you couldn't foresee what an effect&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But oh, dear, I ought certainly to have <i>known</i> <lb/>
better. Why&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"You see, Lasca, if you had said five or six <lb/>
hooks, to start with, and then gradually&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I see, I see&#x2014;then gradually added one, <lb/>
and then two, and then&#x2014;ah, why couldn't I have <lb/>
thought of that!"</p>
<p>"Never mind, child, it's all right&#x2014;I am better <lb/>
now&#x2014;I shall be over it in a little while. <i>But</i>&#x2014;to <lb/>
spring the whole twenty-two on a person unprepared <lb/>
and not very strong anyway&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, it <i>was</i> a crime! But you forgive me&#x2014;say <lb/>
you forgive me. Do!"</p>
<p>After harvesting a good deal of very pleasant <lb/>
coaxing and petting and persuading, I forgave her <lb/>
and she was happy again, and by and by she got <lb/>
under way with her narrative once more. I pres- <lb/>
ently discovered that the family treasury contained <lb/>
still another feature&#x2014;a jewel of some sort, appar- <lb/>
ently&#x2014;and that she was trying to get around speak- <lb/>
ing squarely about it, lest I get paralyzed again. <lb/>
But I wanted to know about that thing, too, and <lb/>
urged her to tell me what it was. She was afraid. <lb/>
<pb n="59"/>
But I insisted, and said I would brace myself this <lb/>
time and be prepared, then the shock would not hurt <lb/>
me. She was full of misgivings, but the temptation <lb/>
to reveal that marvel to me and enjoy my astonish- <lb/>
ment and admiration was too strong for her, and she <lb/>
confessed that she had it on her person, and said <lb/>
that if I was <i>sure</i> I was prepared&#x2014;and so on and <lb/>
so on&#x2014;and with that she reached into her bosom <lb/>
and brought out a battered square of brass, watch- <lb/>
ing my eye anxiously the while. I fell over against <lb/>
her in a quite well-acted faint, which delighted her <lb/>
heart and nearly frightened it out of her, too, at the <lb/>
same time. When I came to and got calm, she was <lb/>
eager to know what I thought of her jewel.</p>
<p>"What do I think of it? I think it is the most <lb/>
exquisite thing I ever saw."</p>
<p>"Do you really? How nice of you to say that! <lb/>
But it <i>is</i> a love, now isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say so! I'd rather own it than <lb/>
the equator."</p>
<p>"I thought you would admire it," she said. "I <lb/>
think it is <i>so</i> lovely. And there isn't another one in <lb/>
all these latitudes. People have come all the way <lb/>
from the Open Polar Sea to look at it. Did you <lb/>
ever see one before?"</p>
<p>I said no, this was the first one I had ever seen. <lb/>
It cost me a pang to tell that generous lie, for I had <lb/>
seen a million of them in my time, this humble jewel <lb/>
of hers being nothing but a battered old New York <lb/>
Central baggage check.</p>
<pb n="60"/>
<p>"Land!" said I, "you don't go about with it <lb/>
on your person this way, alone and with no protec- <lb/>
tion, not even a dog?"</p>
<p>"Ssh! not so loud," she said. "Nobody <lb/>
knows I carry it with me. They think it is in <lb/>
papa's treasury. That is where it generally is."</p>
<p>"Where is the treasury?"</p>
<p>It was a blunt question, and for a moment she <lb/>
looked startled and a little suspicious, but I said:</p>
<p>"Oh, come, don't you be afraid about me. At <lb/>
home we have seventy millions of people, and <lb/>
although I say it myself that shouldn't, there is not <lb/>
one person among them all but would trust me with <lb/>
untold fish-hooks."</p>
<p>This reassured her, and she told me where the <lb/>
hooks were hidden in the house. Then she wandered <lb/>
from her course to brag a little about the size of the <lb/>
sheets of transparent ice that formed the windows of <lb/>
the mansion, and asked me if I had ever seen their <lb/>
like at home, and I came right out frankly and con- <lb/>
fessed that I hadn't, which pleased her more than <lb/>
she could find words to dress her gratification in. It <lb/>
was so easy to please her, and such a pleasure to do <lb/>
it, that I went on and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, Lasca, you <i>are</i> a fortunate girl!&#x2014;this <lb/>
beautiful house, this dainty jewel, that rich treasure, <lb/>
all this elegant snow, and sumptuous icebergs and <lb/>
limitless sterility, and public bears and walruses, and <lb/>
noble freedom and largeness, and everybody's admir- <lb/>
ing eyes upon you, and everybody's homage and re- <lb/>
<pb n="61"/>
spect at your command without the asking; young, <lb/>
rich, beautiful, sought, courted, envied, not a re- <lb/>
quirement unsatisfied, not a desire ungratified, noth- <lb/>
ing to wish for that you cannot have&#x2014;it is immeas- <lb/>
urable good fortune! I have seen myriads of girls, <lb/>
but none of whom these extraordinary things could <lb/>
be truthfully said but you alone. And you are <lb/>
worthy&#x2014;worthy of it all, Lasca&#x2014;I believe it in my <lb/>
heart."</p>
<p>It made her infinitely proud and happy to hear me <lb/>
say this, and she thanked me over and over again <lb/>
for that closing remark, and her voice and eyes <lb/>
showed that she was touched. Presently she said:</p>
<p>"Still, it is not all sunshine&#x2014;there is a cloudy <lb/>
side. The burden of wealth is a heavy one to bear. <lb/>
Sometimes I have doubted if it were not better to be <lb/>
poor&#x2014;at least not inordinately rich. It pains me <lb/>
to see neighboring tribesmen stare as they pass by, <lb/>
and overhear them say, reverently, one to another, <lb/>
'There&#x2014;that is she&#x2014;the millionaire's daughter!' <lb/>
And sometimes they say sorrowfully, 'She is roll- <lb/>
ing in fish-hooks, and I&#x2014;I have nothing.' It breaks <lb/>
my heart. When I was a child and we were poor, <lb/>
we slept with the door open, if we chose, but now <lb/>
&#x2014;now we have to have a night watchman. In those <lb/>
days my father was gentle and courteous to all; but <lb/>
now he is austere and haughty, and cannot abide <lb/>
familiarity. Once his family were his sole thought, <lb/>
but now he goes about thinking of his fish-hooks all <lb/>
the time. And his wealth makes everybody cringing <lb/>
<pb n="62"/>
and obsequious to him. Formerly nobody laughed <lb/>
at his jokes, they being always stale and far-fetched <lb/>
and poor, and destitute of the one element that can <lb/>
really justify a joke&#x2014;the element of humor; but <lb/>
now everybody laughs and cackles at those dismal <lb/>
things, and if any fails to do it my father is deeply <lb/>
displeased, and shows it. Formerly his opinion was <lb/>
not sought upon any matter and was not valuable <lb/>
when he volunteered it; it has that infirmity yet, <lb/>
but nevertheless it is sought by all and applauded <lb/>
by all&#x2014;and he helps do the applauding himself, <lb/>
having no true delicacy and a plentiful want of tact. <lb/>
He has lowered the tone of all our tribe. Once <lb/>
they were a frank and manly race, now they are <lb/>
measly hypocrites, and sodden with servility. In <lb/>
my heart of hearts I hate all the ways of million- <lb/>
aires! Our tribe was once plain, simple folk, and <lb/>
content with the bone fish-hooks of their fathers; <lb/>
now they are eaten up with avarice and would sacri- <lb/>
fice every sentiment of honor and honesty to possess <lb/>
themselves of the debasing iron fish-hooks of the <lb/>
foreigner. However, I must not dwell on these sad <lb/>
things. As I have said, it was my dream to be <lb/>
loved for myself alone.</p>
<p>"At last, this dream seemed about to be fulfilled. <lb/>
A stranger came by, one day, who said his name <lb/>
was Kalula. I told him my name, and he said he <lb/>
loved me. My heart gave a great bound of grati- <lb/>
tude and pleasure, for I had loved him at sight, and <lb/>
now I said so. He took me to his breast and said <lb/>
<pb n="63"/>
he would not wish to be happier than he was now. <lb/>
We went strolling together far over the ice floes, <lb/>
telling all about each other, and planning, oh, the <lb/>
loveliest future! When we were tired at last we sat <lb/>
down and ate, for he had soap and candles and I <lb/>
had brought along some blubber. We were hungry, <lb/>
and nothing was ever so good.</p>
<p>"He belonged to a tribe whose haunts were far to <lb/>
the north, and I found that he had never heard of <lb/>
my father, which rejoiced me exceedingly. I mean <lb/>
he had heard of the millionaire, but had never heard <lb/>
his name&#x2014;so, you see, he could not know that I <lb/>
was the heiress. You may be sure that I did not <lb/>
tell him. I was loved for myself at last, and was <lb/>
satisfied. I was so happy&#x2014;oh, happier than you <lb/>
can think!</p>
<p>"By and by it was toward supper time, and I led <lb/>
him home. As we approached our house he was <lb/>
amazed, and cried out:</p>
<p>"'How splendid! Is <i>that</i> your father's?'</p>
<p>"It gave me a pang to hear that tone and see that <lb/>
admiring light in his eye, but the feeling quickly <lb/>
passed away, for I loved him so, and he looked so <lb/>
handsome and noble. All my family of aunts and <lb/>
uncles and cousins were pleased with him, and many <lb/>
guests were called in, and the house was shut up <lb/>
tight and the rag-lamps lighted, and when everything <lb/>
was hot and comfortable and suffocating, we began <lb/>
a joyous feast in celebration of my betrothal.</p>
<p>"When the feast was over, my father's vanity <lb/>
<pb n="64"/>
overcame him, and he could not resist the temptation <lb/>
to show off his riches and let Kalula see what grand <lb/>
good fortune he had stumbled into&#x2014;and mainly, of <lb/>
course, he wanted to enjoy the poor man's amaze- <lb/>
ment. I could have cried&#x2014;but it would have done <lb/>
no good to try to dissuade my father, so I said noth- <lb/>
ing, but merely sat there and suffered.</p>
<p>"My father went straight to the hiding place, in <lb/>
full sight of everybody, and got out the fish-hooks <lb/>
and brought them and flung them scatteringly over <lb/>
my head, so that they fell in glittering confusion on <lb/>
the platform at my lover's knee.</p>
<p>"Of course, the astounding spectacle took the <lb/>
poor lad's breath away. He could only stare in <lb/>
stupid astonishment, and wonder how a single in- <lb/>
dividual could possess such incredible riches. Then <lb/>
presently he glanced brilliantly up and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"'Ah, it is <i>you</i> who are the renowned millionaire!'</p>
<p>"My father and all the rest burst into shouts of <lb/>
happy laughter, and when my father gathered the <lb/>
treasure carelessly up as if it might be mere rubbish <lb/>
and of no consequence, and carried it back to its <lb/>
place, poor Kalula's surprise was a study. He said:</p>
<p>"'Is it possible that you put such things away <lb/>
without counting them?'</p>
<p>"My father delivered a vainglorious horse-laugh, <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"'Well, truly, a body may know <i>you</i> have never <lb/>
been rich, since a mere matter of a fish-hook or two <lb/>
is such a mighty matter in your eyes.'</p>
<pb n="65"/>
<p>"Kalula was confused, and hung his head, but <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"'Ah, indeed, sir, I was never worth the value of <lb/>
the barb of one of those precious things, and I have <lb/>
never seen any man before who was so rich in them <lb/>
as to render the counting of his hoard worth while, <lb/>
since the wealthiest man I have ever known, till now, <lb/>
was possessed of but three.'</p>
<p>"My foolish father roared again with jejune de- <lb/>
light, and allowed the impression to remain that he <lb/>
was not accustomed to count his hooks and keep <lb/>
sharp watch over them. He was showing off, you see. <lb/>
Count them? Why, he counted them every day!</p>
<p>"I had met and got acquainted with my darling <lb/>
just at dawn; I had brought him home just at dark, <lb/>
three hours afterward&#x2014;for the days were shorten- <lb/>
ing toward the six-months night at that time. We <lb/>
kept up the festivities many hours; then, at last, <lb/>
the guests departed and the rest of us distributed <lb/>
ourselves along the walls on sleeping-benches, and <lb/>
soon all were steeped in dreams but me. I was too <lb/>
happy, too excited, to sleep. After I had lain quiet <lb/>
a long, long time, a dim form passed by me and <lb/>
was swallowed up in the gloom that pervaded the <lb/>
farther end of the house. I could not make out <lb/>
who it was, or whether it was man or woman. <lb/>
Presently that figure or another one passed me going <lb/>
the other way. I wondered what it all meant, but <lb/>
wondering did no good; and while I was still <lb/>
wondering, I fell asleep.</p>
<pb n="66"/>
<p>"I do not know how long I slept, but at last I <lb/>
came suddenly broad awake and heard my father <lb/>
say in a terrible voice, 'By the great Snow God, <lb/>
there's a fish-hook gone!' Something told me that <lb/>
that meant sorrow for me, and the blood in my veins <lb/>
turned cold. The presentiment was confirmed in <lb/>
the same instant: my father shouted, 'Up, every- <lb/>
body, and seize the stranger!' Then there was an <lb/>
outburst of cries and curses from all sides, and a wild <lb/>
rush of dim forms through the obscurity. I flew to <lb/>
my beloved's help, but what could I do but wait and <lb/>
wring my hands?&#x2014;he was already fenced away <lb/>
from me by a living wall, he was being bound hand <lb/>
and foot. Not until he was secured would they let <lb/>
me get to him. I flung myself upon his poor in- <lb/>
sulted form and cried my grief out upon his breast, <lb/>
while my father and all my family scoffed at me and <lb/>
heaped threats and shameful epithets upon him. <lb/>
He bore his ill usage with a tranquil dignity which <lb/>
endeared him to me more than ever, and made me <lb/>
proud and happy to suffer with him and for him. <lb/>
I heard my father order that the elders of the <lb/>
tribe be called together to try my Kalula for his life.</p>
<p>"'What?' I said, 'before any search has been <lb/>
made for the lost hook?'</p>
<p>"'Lost hook!' they all shouted, in derision; <lb/>
and my father added, mockingly, 'Stand back, <lb/>
everybody, and be properly serious&#x2014;she is going <lb/>
to hunt up that <i>lost</i> hook; oh, without doubt she <lb/>
will find it!'&#x2014;whereat they all laughed again.</p>
<pb n="67"/>
<p>"I was not disturbed&#x2014;I had no fears, no doubts. <lb/>
I said:</p>
<p>"'It is for you to laugh now; it is your turn. <lb/>
But ours is coming; wait and see.'</p>
<p>"I got a rag-lamp. I thought I should find that <lb/>
miserable thing in one little moment; and I set <lb/>
about the matter with such confidence that those <lb/>
people grew grave, beginning to suspect that perhaps <lb/>
they had been too hasty. But, alas and alas!&#x2014;oh, <lb/>
the bitterness of that search! There was deep <lb/>
silence while one might count his fingers ten or <lb/>
twelve times, then my heart began to sink, and <lb/>
around me the mockings began again, and grew <lb/>
steadily louder and more assured, until at last, when <lb/>
I gave up, they burst into volley after volley of cruel <lb/>
laughter.</p>
<p>"None will ever know what I suffered then. But <lb/>
my love was my support and my strength, and I <lb/>
took my rightful place at my Kalula's side, and put <lb/>
my arm about his neck, and whispered in his ear, <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"'You are innocent, my own&#x2014;that I know; but <lb/>
say it to me yourself, for my comfort, then I can <lb/>
bear whatever is in store for us.'</p>
<p>"He answered:</p>
<p>"'As surely as I stand upon the brink of death at <lb/>
this moment, I am innocent. Be comforted, then, <lb/>
O bruised heart; be at peace, O thou breath of my <lb/>
nostrils, life of my life!'</p>
<p>"'Now, then, let the elders come!'&#x2014;and as I <lb/>
<pb n="68"/>
said the words there was a gathering sound of <lb/>
crunching snow outside, and then a vision of stoop- <lb/>
ing forms filing in at the door&#x2014;the elders.</p>
<p>"My father formally accused the prisoner, and <lb/>
detailed the happenings of the night. He said that <lb/>
the watchman was outside the door, and that in <lb/>
the house were none but the family and the stranger. <lb/>
'Would the family steal their own property?'</p>
<p>"He paused. The elders sat silent many minutes; <lb/>
at last, one after another said to his neighbor, 'This <lb/>
looks bad for the stranger'&#x2014;sorrowful words for <lb/>
me to hear. Then my father sat down. O miser- <lb/>
able, miserable me! at that very moment I could have <lb/>
proved my darling innocent, but I did not know it!</p>
<p>"The chief of the court asked:</p>
<p>"'Is there any here to defend the prisoner?'</p>
<p>"I rose and said:</p>
<p>"'Why should <i>he</i> steal that hook, or any or all of <lb/>
them? In another day he would have been heir to <lb/>
the whole!'</p>
<p>"I stood waiting. There was a long silence, the <lb/>
steam from the many breaths rising about me like a <lb/>
fog. At last, one elder after another nodded his <lb/>
head slowly several times, and muttered, 'There is <lb/>
force in what the child has said.' Oh, the heart- <lb/>
lift that was in those words!&#x2014;so transient, but <lb/>
oh, so precious! I sat down.</p>
<p>"'If any would say further, let him speak now, <lb/>
or after hold his peace,' said the chief of the court.</p>
<p>"My father rose and said:</p>
<pb n="69"/>
<p>"'In the night a form passed by me in the <lb/>
gloom, going toward the treasury, and presently <lb/>
returned. I think, now, it was the stranger.'</p>
<p>"Oh, I was like to swoon! I had supposed that <lb/>
that was my secret; not the grip of the great Ice <lb/>
God himself could have dragged it out of my heart.</p>
<p>The chief of the court said sternly to my poor <lb/>
Kalula:</p>
<p>"'Speak!'</p>
<p>"Kalula hesitated, then answered:</p>
<p>"'It was I. I could not sleep for thinking of the <lb/>
beautiful hooks. I went there and kissed them and <lb/>
fondled them, to appease my spirit and drown it in <lb/>
a harmless joy, then I put them back. I may have <lb/>
dropped one, but I stole none.'</p>
<p>"Oh, a fatal admission to make in such a place! <lb/>
There was an awful hush. I knew he had pro- <lb/>
nounced his own doom, and that all was over. On <lb/>
every face you could see the words hieroglyphed: <lb/>
'It is a confession!&#x2014;and paltry, lame, and thin.'</p>
<p>"I sat drawing in my breath in faint gasps&#x2014;and <lb/>
waiting. Presently, I heard the solemn words I <lb/>
knew were coming; and each word, as it came, was <lb/>
a knife in my heart:</p>
<p>"'It is the command of the court that the accused <lb/>
be subjected to the <i>trial by water</i>.'</p>
<p>"Oh, curses be upon the head of him who <lb/>
brought 'trial by water' to our land! It came, <lb/>
generations ago, from some far country, that lies <lb/>
none knows where. Before that, our fathers used <lb/>
<pb n="70"/>
augury and other unsure methods of trial, and <lb/>
doubtless some poor, guilty creatures escaped with <lb/>
their lives sometimes; but it is not so with trial by <lb/>
water, which is an invention by wiser men than we <lb/>
poor, ignorant savages are. By it the innocent are <lb/>
proved innocent, without doubt or question, for <lb/>
they drown; and the guilty are proven guilty with <lb/>
the same certainty, for they do not drown. My <lb/>
heart was breaking in my bosom, for I said, 'He is <lb/>
innocent, and he will go down under the waves and <lb/>
I shall never see him more.'</p>
<p>"I never left his side after that. I mourned in his <lb/>
arms all the precious hours, and he poured out the <lb/>
deep stream of his love upon me, and oh, I was so <lb/>
miserable and so happy! At last, they tore him <lb/>
from me, and I followed sobbing after them, and <lb/>
saw them fling him into the sea&#x2014;then I covered my <lb/>
face with my hands. Agony? Oh, I know the <lb/>
deepest deeps of that word!</p>
<p>"The next moment the people burst into a shout <lb/>
of malicious joy, and I took away my hands, <lb/>
startled. Oh, bitter sight&#x2014;he was <i>swimming!</i></p>
<p>"My heart turned instantly to stone, to ice. I <lb/>
said, 'He was guilty, and he lied to me!'</p>
<p>"I turned my back in scorn and went my way <lb/>
homeward.</p>
<p>"They took him far out to sea and set him on an <lb/>
iceberg that was drifting southward in the great <lb/>
waters. Then my family came home, and my <lb/>
father said to me:</p>
<pb n="71"/>
<p>"'Your thief sent his dying message to you, say- <lb/>
ing, "Tell her I am innocent, and that all the days <lb/>
and all the hours and all the minutes while I starve <lb/>
and perish I shall love her and think of her and bless <lb/>
the day that gave me sight of her sweet face." <lb/>
Quite pretty, even poetical!'</p>
<p>"I said, 'He is dirt&#x2014;let me never hear mention <lb/>
of him again.' And oh, to think&#x2014;he <i>was</i> inno- <lb/>
cent all the time!</p>
<p>"Nine months&#x2014;nine dull, sad months&#x2014;went <lb/>
by, and at last came the day of the Great Annual <lb/>
Sacrifice, when all the maidens of the tribe wash <lb/>
their faces and comb their hair. With the first <lb/>
sweep of my comb, out came the fatal fish-hook <lb/>
from where it had been all those months nestling, <lb/>
and I fell fainting into the arms of my remorseful <lb/>
father! Groaning, he said, 'We murdered him, <lb/>
and I shall never smile again!' He has kept his <lb/>
word. Listen: from that day to this not a month <lb/>
goes by that I do not comb my hair. But oh, where <lb/>
is the good of it all now!"</p>
<p>So ended the poor maid's humble little tale&#x2014; <lb/>
whereby we learn that, since a hundred million dol- <lb/>
lars in New York and twenty-two fish-hooks on the <lb/>
border of the Arctic Circle represent the same <lb/>
financial supremacy, a man in straitened circum- <lb/>
stances is a fool to stay in New York when he can <lb/>
buy ten cents' worth of fish-hooks and emigrate.</p>

<head><b>THE MAN THAT CORRUPTED <lb/>
</b></head>
<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head>I</head>
<p><smcap>It</smcap> was many years ago. Hadleyburg was the most <lb/>
honest and upright town in all the region round <lb/>
about. It had kept that reputation unsmirched dur- <lb/>
ing three generations, and was prouder of it than of <lb/>
any other of its possessions. It was so proud of it, <lb/>
and so anxious to insure its perpetuation, that it be- <lb/>
gan to teach the principles of honest dealing to its <lb/>
babies in the cradle, and made the like teachings the <lb/>
staple of their culture thenceforward through all the <lb/>
years devoted to their education. Also, throughout <lb/>
the formative years temptations were kept out of the <lb/>
way of the young people, so that their honesty could <lb/>
have every chance to harden and solidify, and be- <lb/>
come a part of their very bone. The neighboring <lb/>
towns were jealous of this honorable supremacy, <lb/>
and affected to sneer at Hadleyburg's pride in it and <lb/>
call it vanity; but all the same they were obliged to <lb/>
acknowledge that Hadleyburg was in reality an in- <lb/>
corruptible town; and if pressed they would also <lb/>
acknowledge that the mere fact that a young man <lb/>
<pb n="73"/>
hailed from Hadleyburg was all the recommendation <lb/>
he needed when he went forth from his natal town <lb/>
to seek for responsible employment.</p>
<p>But at last, in the drift of time, Hadleyburg had <lb/>
the ill luck to offend a passing stranger&#x2014;possibly <lb/>
without knowing it, certainly without caring, for <lb/>
Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself, and cared not <lb/>
a rap for strangers or their opinions. Still, it would <lb/>
have been well to make an exception in this one's <lb/>
case, for he was a bitter man and revengeful. All <lb/>
through his wanderings during a whole year he kept <lb/>
his injury in mind, and gave all his leisure moments <lb/>
to trying to invent a compensating satisfaction for it. <lb/>
He contrived many plans, and all of them were <lb/>
good, but none of them was quite sweeping enough; <lb/>
the poorest of them would hurt a great many indi- <lb/>
viduals, but what he wanted was a plan which would <lb/>
comprehend the entire town, and not let so much as <lb/>
one person escape unhurt. At last he had a for- <lb/>
tunate idea, and when it fell into his brain it lit up <lb/>
his whole head with an evil joy. He began to form <lb/>
a plan at once, saying to himself, "That is the thing <lb/>
to do&#x2014;I will corrupt the town."</p>
<p>Six months later he went to Hadleyburg, and <lb/>
arrived in a buggy at the house of the old cashier of <lb/>
the bank about ten at night. He got a sack out of <lb/>
the buggy, shouldered it, and staggered with it <lb/>
through the cottage yard, and knocked at the door. <lb/>
A woman's voice said "Come in," and he entered, <lb/>
and set his sack behind the stove in the parlor, <lb/>
<pb n="74"/>
saying politely to the old lady who sat reading the <lb/>
<i>Missionary Herald</i> by the lamp:</p>
<p>"Pray keep your seat, madam, I will not disturb <lb/>
you. There&#x2014;now it is pretty well concealed; one <lb/>
would hardly know it was there. Can I see your <lb/>
husband a moment, madam?"</p>
<p>No, he was gone to Brixton, and might not return <lb/>
before morning.</p>
<p>"Very well, madam, it is no matter. I merely <lb/>
wanted to leave that sack in his care, to be delivered <lb/>
to the rightful owner when he shall be found. I am <lb/>
a stranger; he does not know me; I am merely <lb/>
passing through the town to-night to discharge a <lb/>
matter which has been long in my mind. My <lb/>
errand is now completed, and I go pleased and a <lb/>
little proud, and you will never see me again. <lb/>
There is a paper attached to the sack which will <lb/>
explain everything. Good-night, madam."</p>
<p>The old lady was afraid of the mysterious big <lb/>
stranger, and was glad to see him go. But her <lb/>
curiosity was roused, and she went straight to the <lb/>
sack and brought away the paper. It began as <lb/>
follows: <lb/>
<q><i>"<smcap>to be Published</smcap>; or, the right man sought out by private in- <lb/>
quiry&#x2014;either will answer. This sack contains gold coin weighing a <lb/>
hundred and sixty pounds four ounces&#x2014;"</i></q></p>
<p>"Mercy on us, and the door not locked!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and <lb/>
locked it, then pulled down the window-shades and <lb/>
stood frightened, worried, and wondering if there <lb/>
<pb n="75"/>
was anything else she could do toward making her- <lb/>
self and the money more safe. She listened awhile <lb/>
for burglars, then surrendered to curiosity and went <lb/>
back to the lamp and finished reading the paper: <lb/>
<q><i>"I am a foreigner, and am presently going back to my own country, <lb/>
to remain there permanently. I am grateful to America for what I <lb/>
have received at her hands during my long stay under her flag; and to <lb/>
one of her citizens&#x2014;a citizen of Hadleyburg&#x2014;I am especially grateful <lb/>
for a great kindness done me a year or two ago. Two great kindnesses, <lb/>
in fact. I will explain. I was a gambler. I say I</i> <smcap>was</smcap>. <i>I was a <lb/>
ruined gambler. I arrived in this village at night, hungry and without <lb/>
a penny. I asked for help&#x2014;in the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the <lb/>
light. I begged of the right man. He gave me twenty dollars&#x2014;that <lb/>
is to say, he gave me life, as I considered it. He also gave me fortune; <lb/>
for out of that money I have made myself rich at the gaming-table. <lb/>
And finally, a remark which he made to me has remained with me to <lb/>
this day, and has at last conquered me; and in conquering has saved <lb/>
the remnant of my morals: I shall gamble no more. Now I have no <lb/>
idea who that man was, but I want him found, and I want him to <lb/>
have this money, to give away, throw away, or keep, as he pleases. It <lb/>
is merely my way of testifying my gratitude to him. If I could stay, <lb/>
I would find him myself; but no matter, he will be found. This is an <lb/>
honest town, an incorruptible town, and I know I can trust it without <lb/>
fear. This man can be identified by the remark which he made to <lb/>
me; I feel persuaded that he will remember it.</i></q>
<q><i>"And now my plan is this: If you prefer to conduct the inquiry <lb/>
privately, do so. Tell the contents of this present writing to any one <lb/>
who is likely to be the right man. If he shall answer, 'I am the man; <lb/>
the remark I made was so-and-so,' apply the test&#x2014;to wit: open the <lb/>
sack, and in it you will find a sealed envelope containing that remark. <lb/>
If the remark mentioned by the candidate tallies with it, give him the <lb/>
money, and ask no further questions, for he is certainly the right man.</i></q>
<q><i>"But if you shall prefer a public inquiry, then publish this pres- <lb/>
ent writing in the local paper&#x2014;with these instructions added, to wit: <lb/>
Thirty days from now, let the candidate appear at the town-hall at <lb/>
eight in the evening (Friday), and hand his remark, in a sealed en- <lb/>
velope, to the Rev. Mr. Burgess (if he will be kind enough to act); and</i> <lb/>
<pb n="76"/>
<i>let Mr. Burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack, open it, <lb/>
and see if the remark is correct; if correct, let the money be delivered, <lb/>
with my sincere gratitude, to my benefactor thus identified."</i></q></p>
<p>Mrs. Richards sat down, gently quivering with <lb/>
excitement, and was soon lost in thinkings&#x2014;after <lb/>
this pattern: "What a strange thing it is! &#x2026; <lb/>
And what a fortune for that kind man who set <lb/>
his bread afloat upon the waters! &#x2026; If it had <lb/>
only been my husband that did it!&#x2014;for we are so <lb/>
poor, so old and poor! &#x2026;" Then, with a sigh <lb/>
&#x2014;"But it was not my Edward; no, it was not he <lb/>
that gave a stranger twenty dollars. It is a pity, <lb/>
too; I see it now&#x2026;." Then, with a shudder&#x2014; <lb/>
"But it is <i>gambler's</i> money! the wages of sin: we <lb/>
couldn't take it; we couldn't touch it. I don't like <lb/>
to be near it; it seems a defilement." She moved <lb/>
to a farther chair&#x2026;. "I wish Edward would <lb/>
come, and take it to the bank; a burglar might <lb/>
come at any moment; it is dreadful to be here all <lb/>
alone with it."</p>
<p>At eleven Mr. Richards arrived, and while his wife <lb/>
was saying, "I am <i>so</i> glad you've come!" he was <lb/>
saying, "I'm so tired&#x2014;tired clear out; it is dread- <lb/>
ful to be poor, and have to make these dismal jour- <lb/>
neys at my time of life. Always at the grind, grind, <lb/>
grind, on a salary&#x2014;another man's slave, and he sit- <lb/>
ting at home in his slippers, rich and comfortable."</p>
<p>"I am so sorry for you, Edward, you know that; <lb/>
but be comforted: we have our livelihood; we <lb/>
have our good name&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="77"/>
<p>"Yes, Mary, and that is everything. Don't mind <lb/>
my talk&#x2014;it's just a moment's irritation and doesn't <lb/>
mean anything. Kiss me&#x2014;there, it's all gone now, <lb/>
and I am not complaining any more. What have <lb/>
you been getting? What's in the sack?"</p>
<p>Then his wife told him the great secret. It dazed <lb/>
him for a moment; then he said:</p>
<p>"It weighs a hundred and sixty pounds? Why, <lb/>
Mary, it's for-ty thou-sand dollars&#x2014;think of it&#x2014;a <lb/>
whole fortune! Not ten men in this village are <lb/>
worth that much. Give me the paper."</p>
<p>He skimmed through it and said:</p>
<p>"Isn't it an adventure! Why, it's a romance; <lb/>
it's like the impossible things one reads about in <lb/>
books, and never sees in life." He was well stirred <lb/>
up now; cheerful, even gleeful. He tapped his old <lb/>
wife on the cheek, and said, humorously, "Why, <lb/>
we're rich, Mary, rich; all we've got to do is to <lb/>
bury the money and burn the papers. If the <lb/>
gambler ever comes to inquire, we'll merely look <lb/>
coldly upon him and say: 'What is this nonsense <lb/>
you are talking? We have never heard of you and <lb/>
your sack of gold before;' and then he would look <lb/>
foolish, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"And in the meantime, while you are running on <lb/>
with your jokes, the money is still here, and it is fast <lb/>
getting along toward burglar-time."</p>
<p>"True. Very well, what shall we do&#x2014;make the <lb/>
inquiry private? No, not that: it would spoil the <lb/>
romance. The public method is better. Think <lb/>
<pb n="78"/>
what a noise it will make! And it will make all the <lb/>
other towns jealous; for no stranger would trust <lb/>
such a thing to any town but Hadleyburg, and they <lb/>
know it. It's a great card for us. I must get to <lb/>
the printing-office now, or I shall be too late."</p>
<p>"But stop&#x2014;stop&#x2014;don't leave me here alone <lb/>
with it, Edward!"</p>
<p>But he was gone. For only a little while, how- <lb/>
ever. Not far from his own house he met the <lb/>
editor-proprietor of the paper, and gave him the <lb/>
document, and said, "Here is a good thing for you, <lb/>
Cox&#x2014;put it in."</p>
<p>"It may be too late, Mr. Richards, but I'll see."</p>
<p>At home again he and his wife sat down to talk <lb/>
the charming mystery over; they were in no con- <lb/>
dition for sleep. The first question was, Who could <lb/>
the citizen have been who gave the stranger the <lb/>
twenty dollars? It seemed a simple one; both <lb/>
answered it in the same breath&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Barclay Goodson."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Richards, "he could have done it, <lb/>
and it would have been like him, but there's not <lb/>
another in the town."</p>
<p>"Everybody will grant that, Edward&#x2014;grant it <lb/>
privately, anyway. For six months, now, the vil- <lb/>
lage has been its own proper self once more&#x2014;hon- <lb/>
est, narrow, self-righteous, and stingy."</p>
<p>"It is what he always called it, to the day of his <lb/>
death&#x2014;said it right out publicly, too."</p>
<p>"Yes, and he was hated for it."</p>
<pb n="79"/>
<p>"Oh, of course; but he didn't care. I reckon <lb/>
he was the best-hated man among us, except the <lb/>
Reverend Burgess."</p>
<p>"Well, Burgess deserves it&#x2014;he will never get <lb/>
another congregation here. Mean as the town is, it <lb/>
knows how to estimate <i>him</i>. Edward, doesn't it <lb/>
seem odd that the stranger should appoint Burgess <lb/>
to deliver the money?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes&#x2014;it does. That is&#x2014;that is&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Why so much that-<i>is</i>-ing? Would <i>you</i> select <lb/>
him?"</p>
<p>"Mary, maybe the stranger knows him better <lb/>
than this village does."</p>
<p>"Much <i>that</i> would help Burgess!"</p>
<p>The husband seemed perplexed for an answer; <lb/>
the wife kept a steady eye upon him, and waited. <lb/>
Finally Richards said, with the hesitancy of one <lb/>
who is making a statement which is likely to en- <lb/>
counter doubt,</p>
<p>"Mary, Burgess is not a bad man."</p>
<p>His wife was certainly surprised.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"He is not a bad man. I know. The whole of <lb/>
his unpopularity had its foundation in that one thing <lb/>
&#x2014;the thing that made so much noise."</p>
<p>"That 'one thing,' indeed! As if that 'one <lb/>
thing' wasn't enough, all by itself."</p>
<p>"Plenty. Plenty. Only he wasn't guilty of it."</p>
<p>"How you talk! Not guilty of it! Everybody <lb/>
knows he <i>was</i> guilty."</p>
<pb n="80"/>
<p>"Mary, I give you my word&#x2014;he was innocent."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it, and I don't. How do you <lb/>
know?"</p>
<p>"It is a confession. I am ashamed, but I will <lb/>
make it. I was the only man who knew he was <lb/>
innocent. I could have saved him, and&#x2014;and&#x2014; <lb/>
well, you know how the town was wrought up&#x2014;I <lb/>
hadn't the pluck to do it. It would have turned <lb/>
everybody against me. I felt mean, ever so mean; <lb/>
but I didn't dare; I hadn't the manliness to face <lb/>
that."</p>
<p>Mary looked troubled, and for a while was silent. <lb/>
Then she said, stammeringly:</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;I don't think it would have done for you to <lb/>
&#x2014;to&#x2014; One mustn't&#x2014;er&#x2014;public opinion&#x2014;one <lb/>
has to be so careful&#x2014;so&#x2014;" It was a difficult road, <lb/>
and she got mired; but after a little she got started <lb/>
again. "It was a great pity, but&#x2014; Why, we <lb/>
couldn't afford it, Edward&#x2014;we couldn't indeed. <lb/>
Oh, I wouldn't have had you do it for anything!"</p>
<p>"It would have lost us the good-will of so many <lb/>
people, Mary; and then&#x2014;and then&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What troubles me now is, what <i>he</i> thinks of us, <lb/>
Edward."</p>
<p>"He? <i>He</i> doesn't suspect that I could have <lb/>
saved him."</p>
<p>"Oh," exclaimed the wife, in a tone of relief, "I <lb/>
am glad of that. As long as he doesn't know that <lb/>
you could have saved him, he&#x2014;he&#x2014;well, that <lb/>
makes it a great deal better. Why, I might have <lb/>
<pb n="81"/>
known he didn't know, because he is always trying <lb/>
to be friendly with us, as little encouragement as we <lb/>
give him. More than once people have twitted me <lb/>
with it. There's the Wilsons, and the Wilcoxes, <lb/>
and the Harknesses, they take a mean pleasure in <lb/>
saying, '<i>Your friend</i> Burgess,' because they know it <lb/>
pesters me. I wish he wouldn't persist in liking us <lb/>
so; I can't think why he keeps it up."</p>
<p>"I can explain it. It's another confession. <lb/>
When the thing was new and hot, and the town <lb/>
made a plan to ride him on a rail, my conscience <lb/>
hurt me so that I couldn't stand it, and I went <lb/>
privately and gave him notice, and he got out of <lb/>
the town and staid out till it was safe to come back."</p>
<p>"Edward! If the town had found it out&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"<i>Don't!</i> It scares me yet, to think of it. I <lb/>
repented of it the minute it was done; and I was <lb/>
even afraid to tell you, lest your face might betray <lb/>
it to somebody. I didn't sleep any that night, for <lb/>
worrying. But after a few days I saw that no one <lb/>
was going to suspect me, and after that I got to <lb/>
feeling glad I did it. And I feel glad yet, Mary&#x2014; <lb/>
glad through and through."</p>
<p>"So do I, now, for it would have been a dreadful <lb/>
way to treat him. Yes, I'm glad; for really you did <lb/>
owe him that, you know. But, Edward, suppose it <lb/>
should come out yet, some day!"</p>
<p>"It won't."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because everybody thinks it was Goodson."</p>
<pb n="82"/>
<p>"Of course they would!"</p>
<p>"Certainly. And of course <i>he</i> didn't care. <lb/>
They persuaded poor old Sawlsberry to go and <lb/>
charge it on him, and he went blustering over there <lb/>
and did it. Goodson looked him over, like as if he <lb/>
was hunting for a place on him that he could despise <lb/>
the most, then he says, 'So you are the Committee <lb/>
of Inquiry, are you?' Sawlsberry said that was <lb/>
about what he was. 'Hm. Do they require par- <lb/>
ticulars, or do you reckon a kind of a <i>general</i> <lb/>
answer will do?' 'If they require particulars, I will <lb/>
come back, Mr. Goodson; I will take the general <lb/>
answer first.' 'Very well, then, tell them to go to <lb/>
hell&#x2014;I reckon that's general enough. And I'll <lb/>
give you some advice, Sawlsberry; when you come <lb/>
back for the particulars, fetch a basket to carry the <lb/>
relics of yourself home in.'"</p>
<p>"Just like Goodson; it's got all the marks. He <lb/>
had only one vanity: he thought he could give <lb/>
advice better than any other person."</p>
<p>"It settled the business, and saved us, Mary. <lb/>
The subject was dropped."</p>
<p>"Bless you, I'm not doubting <i>that</i>."</p>
<p>Then they took up the gold-sack mystery again, <lb/>
with strong interest. Soon the conversation began <lb/>
to suffer breaks&#x2014;interruptions caused by absorbed <lb/>
thinkings. The breaks grew more and more fre- <lb/>
quent. At last Richards lost himself wholly in <lb/>
thought. He sat long, gazing vacantly at the floor, <lb/>
and by and by he began to punctuate his thoughts <lb/>
<pb n="83"/>
with little nervous movements of his hands that <lb/>
seemed to indicate vexation. Meantime his wife <lb/>
too had relapsed into a thoughtful silence, and her <lb/>
movements were beginning to show a troubled dis- <lb/>
comfort. Finally Richards got up and strode aim- <lb/>
lessly about the room, plowing his hands through <lb/>
his hair, much as a somnambulist might do who was <lb/>
having a bad dream. Then he seemed to arrive at a <lb/>
definite purpose; and without a word he put on his <lb/>
hat and passed quickly out of the house. His wife <lb/>
sat brooding, with a drawn face, and did not seem <lb/>
to be aware that she was alone. Now and then she <lb/>
murmured, "Lead us not into t&#x2014; &#x2026; but&#x2014;but <lb/>
&#x2014;we are so poor, so poor! &#x2026; Lead us not <lb/>
into&#x2026;. Ah, who would be hurt by it?&#x2014;and no <lb/>
one would ever know&#x2026;. Lead us&#x2026;." The <lb/>
voice died out in mumblings. After a little she <lb/>
glanced up and muttered in a half-frightened, half- <lb/>
glad way&#x2014;</p>
<p>"He is gone! But, oh dear, he may be too late <lb/>
&#x2014;too late&#x2026;. Maybe not&#x2014;maybe there is still <lb/>
time." She rose and stood thinking, nervously <lb/>
clasping and unclasping her hands. A slight shud- <lb/>
der shook her frame, and she said, out of a dry <lb/>
throat, "God forgive me&#x2014;it's awful to think such <lb/>
things&#x2014;but &#x2026; Lord, how we are made&#x2014;how <lb/>
strangely we are made!"</p>
<p>She turned the light low, and slipped stealthily <lb/>
over and kneeled down by the sack and felt of its <lb/>
ridgy sides with her hands, and fondled them lov- <lb/>
<pb n="84"/>
ingly; and there was a gloating light in her poor old <lb/>
eyes. She fell into fits of absence; and came half <lb/>
out of them at times to mutter, "If we had only <lb/>
waited!&#x2014;oh, if we had only waited a little, and not <lb/>
been in such a hurry!"</p>
<p>Meantime Cox had gone home from his office and <lb/>
told his wife all about the strange thing that had hap- <lb/>
pened, and they had talked it over eagerly, and <lb/>
guessed that the late Goodson was the only man in <lb/>
the town who could have helped a suffering stranger <lb/>
with so noble a sum as twenty dollars. Then there <lb/>
was a pause, and the two became thoughtful and <lb/>
silent. And by and by nervous and fidgety. At <lb/>
last the wife said, as if to herself,</p>
<p>"Nobody knows this secret but the Richardses <lb/>
&#x2026; and us &#x2026; nobody."</p>
<p>The husband came out of his thinkings with a <lb/>
slight start, and gazed wistfully at his wife, whose <lb/>
face was become very pale; then he hesitatingly <lb/>
rose, and glanced furtively at his hat, then at his <lb/>
wife&#x2014;a sort of mute inquiry. Mrs. Cox swallowed <lb/>
once or twice, with her hand at her throat, then in <lb/>
place of speech she nodded her head. In a moment <lb/>
she was alone, and mumbling to herself.</p>
<p>And now Richards and Cox were hurrying <lb/>
through the deserted streets, from opposite direc- <lb/>
tions. They met, panting, at the foot of the print- <lb/>
ing-office stairs; by the night-light there they read <lb/>
each other's face. Cox whispered,</p>
<p>"Nobody knows about this but us?"</p>
<pb n="85"/>
<p>The whispered answer was,</p>
<p>"Not a soul&#x2014;on honor, not a soul!"</p>
<p>"If it isn't too late to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The men were starting up-stairs; at this moment <lb/>
they were overtaken by a boy, and Cox asked,</p>
<p>"Is that you, Johnny?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"You needn't ship the early mail&#x2014;nor <i>any</i> <lb/>
mail; wait till I tell you."</p>
<p>"It's already gone, sir."</p>
<p>"<i>Gone?</i>" It had the sound of an unspeakable <lb/>
disappointment in it.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Time-table for Brixton and all the <lb/>
towns beyond changed to-day, sir&#x2014;had to get the <lb/>
papers in twenty minutes earlier than common. I <lb/>
had to rush; if I had been two minutes later&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The men turned and walked slowly away, not <lb/>
waiting to hear the rest. Neither of them spoke <lb/>
during ten minutes; then Cox said, in a vexed tone,</p>
<p>"What possessed you to be in such a hurry, <i>I</i> <lb/>
can't make out."</p>
<p>The answer was humble enough:</p>
<p>"I see it now, but somehow I never thought, you <lb/>
know, until it was too late. But the next time&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Next time be hanged! It won't come in a <lb/>
thousand years."</p>
<p>Then the friends separated without a good-night, <lb/>
and dragged themselves home with the gait of <lb/>
mortally stricken men. At their homes their wives <lb/>
sprang up with an eager "Well?"&#x2014;then saw the <lb/>
<pb n="86"/>
answer with their eyes and sank down sorrowing, <lb/>
without waiting for it to come in words. In both <lb/>
houses a discussion followed of a heated sort&#x2014;a <lb/>
new thing; there had been discussions before, but <lb/>
not heated ones, not ungentle ones. The discussions <lb/>
to-night were a sort of seeming plagiarisms of each <lb/>
other. Mrs. Richards said,</p>
<p>"If you had only waited, Edward&#x2014;if you had <lb/>
only stopped to think; but no, you must run straight <lb/>
to the printing-office and spread it all over the world."</p>
<p>"It <i>said</i> publish it."</p>
<p>"That is nothing; it also said do it privately, if <lb/>
you liked. There, now&#x2014;is that true, or not?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes&#x2014;yes, it is true; but when I thought <lb/>
what a stir it would make, and what a compliment it <lb/>
was to Hadleyburg that a stranger should trust it <lb/>
so&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly, I know all that; but if you had <lb/>
only stopped to think, you would have seen that <lb/>
you <i>couldn't</i> find the right man, because he is in his <lb/>
grave, and hasn't left chick nor child nor relation <lb/>
behind him; and as long as the money went to <lb/>
somebody that awfully needed it, and nobody would <lb/>
be hurt by it, and&#x2014;and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>She broke down, crying. Her husband tried to <lb/>
think of some comforting thing to say, and presently <lb/>
came out with this:</p>
<p>"But after all, Mary, it must be for the best&#x2014;it <lb/>
<i>must</i> be; we know that. And we must remember <lb/>
that it was so ordered&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="87"/>
<p>"Ordered! Oh, everything's <i>ordered</i>, when a <lb/>
person has to find some way out when he has been <lb/>
stupid. Just the same, it was <i>ordered</i> that the <lb/>
money should come to us in this special way, and <lb/>
it was you that must take it on yourself to go med- <lb/>
dling with the designs of Providence&#x2014;and who <lb/>
gave you the right? It was wicked, that is what it <lb/>
was&#x2014;just blasphemous presumption, and no more <lb/>
becoming to a meek and humble professor of&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But, Mary, you know how we have been trained <lb/>
all our lives long, like the whole village, till it is <lb/>
absolutely second nature to us to stop not a single <lb/>
moment to think when there's an honest thing to be <lb/>
done&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it, I know it&#x2014;it's been one ever- <lb/>
lasting training and training and training in honesty <lb/>
&#x2014;honesty shielded, from the very cradle, against <lb/>
every possible temptation, and so it's <i>artificial</i> <lb/>
honesty, and weak as water when temptation comes, <lb/>
as we have seen this night. God knows I never had <lb/>
shade nor shadow of a doubt of my petrified and <lb/>
indestructible honesty until now&#x2014;and now, under <lb/>
the very first big and real temptation, I&#x2014;Edward, <lb/>
it is my belief that this town's honesty is as rotten <lb/>
as mine is; as rotten as yours is. It is a mean <lb/>
town, a hard, stingy town, and hasn't a virtue in the <lb/>
world but this honesty it is so celebrated for and so <lb/>
conceited about; and so help me, I do believe that <lb/>
if ever the day comes that its honesty falls under <lb/>
great temptation, its grand reputation will go to ruin <lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
like a house of cards. There, now, I've made con- <lb/>
fession, and I feel better; I am a humbug, and I've <lb/>
been one all my life, without knowing it. Let no <lb/>
man call me honest again&#x2014;I will not have it."</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;well, Mary, I feel a good deal as you do; <lb/>
I certainly do. It seems strange, too, so strange. <lb/>
I never could have believed it&#x2014;never."</p>
<p>A long silence followed; both were sunk in <lb/>
thought. At last the wife looked up and said,</p>
<p>"I know what you are thinking, Edward."</p>
<p>Richards had the embarrassed look of a person <lb/>
who is caught.</p>
<p>"I am ashamed to confess it, Mary, but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"It's no matter, Edward, I was thinking the same <lb/>
question myself."</p>
<p>"I hope so. State it."</p>
<p>"You were thinking, if a body could only guess <lb/>
out <i>what the remark was</i> that Goodson made to the <lb/>
stranger."</p>
<p>"It's perfectly true. I feel guilty and ashamed. <lb/>
And you?"</p>
<p>"I'm past it. Let us make a pallet here; we've <lb/>
got to stand watch till the bank vault opens in the <lb/>
morning and admits the sack&#x2026;. Oh dear, oh <lb/>
dear&#x2014;if we hadn't made the mistake!"</p>
<p>The pallet was made, and Mary said:</p>
<p>"The open sesame&#x2014;what could it have been? I <lb/>
do wonder what that remark could have been? <lb/>
But come; we will get to bed now."</p>
<p>"And sleep?"</p>
<pb n="89"/>
<p>"No: think."</p>
<p>"Yes, think."</p>
<p>By this time the Coxes too had completed their <lb/>
spat and their reconciliation, and were turning in&#x2014; <lb/>
to think, to think, and toss, and fret, and worry <lb/>
over what the remark could possibly have been <lb/>
which Goodson made to the stranded derelict; that <lb/>
golden remark; that remark worth forty thousand <lb/>
dollars, cash.</p>
<p>The reason that the village telegraph office was <lb/>
open later than usual that night was this: The <lb/>
foreman of Cox's paper was the local representative <lb/>
of the Associated Press. One might say its honor- <lb/>
ary representative, for it wasn't four times a year <lb/>
that he could furnish thirty words that would be <lb/>
accepted. But this time it was different. His <lb/>
dispatch stating what he had caught got an instant <lb/>
answer: <lb/>
<q>"<i>Send the whole thing&#x2014;all the details&#x2014;twelve hundred words</i>."</q></p>
<p>A colossal order! The foreman filled the bill; <lb/>
and he was the proudest man in the State. By break- <lb/>
fast-time the next morning the name of Hadleyburg <lb/>
the Incorruptible was on every lip in America, from <lb/>
Montreal to the Gulf, from the glaciers of Alaska to <lb/>
the orange-groves of Florida; and millions and mill- <lb/>
ions of people were discussing the stranger and his <lb/>
money-sack, and wondering if the right man would <lb/>
be found, and hoping some more news about the <lb/>
matter would come soon&#x2014;right away.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="II">
<pb n="90"/>
<head>II</head>
<p>Hadleyburg village woke up world-celebrated&#x2014; <lb/>
astonished&#x2014;happy&#x2014;vain. Vain beyond imagina- <lb/>
tion. Its nineteen principal citizens and their wives <lb/>
went about shaking hands with each other, and <lb/>
beaming, and smiling, and congratulating, and say- <lb/>
ing <i>this</i> thing adds a new word to the dictionary&#x2014; <lb/>
<i>Hadleyburg</i>, synonym for <i>incorruptible</i>&#x2014;destined to <lb/>
live in dictionaries forever! And the minor and <lb/>
unimportant citizens and their wives went around <lb/>
acting in much the same way. Everybody ran to <lb/>
the bank to see the gold-sack; and before noon <lb/>
grieved and envious crowds began to flock in from <lb/>
Brixton and all neighboring towns; and that after- <lb/>
noon and next day reporters began to arrive from <lb/>
everywhere to verify the sack and its history and <lb/>
write the whole thing up anew, and make dashing <lb/>
free-hand pictures of the sack, and of Richards's <lb/>
house, and the bank, and the Presbyterian church, <lb/>
and the Baptist church, and the public square, and <lb/>
the town-hall where the test would be applied and <lb/>
the money delivered; and damnable portraits of the <lb/>
Richardses, and Pinkerton the banker, and Cox, <lb/>
and the foreman, and Reverend Burgess, and the <lb/>
postmaster&#x2014;and even of Jack Halliday, who was <lb/>
the loafing, good-natured, no-account, irreverent <lb/>
fisherman, hunter, boys' friend, stray-dogs' friend, <lb/>
typical "Sam Lawson" of the town. The little <lb/>
mean, smirking, oily Pinkerton showed the sack to <lb/>
all comers, and rubbed his sleek palms together <lb/>
<pb n="91"/>
pleasantly, and enlarged upon the town's fine old <lb/>
reputation for honesty and upon this wonderful <lb/>
endorsement of it, and hoped and believed that the <lb/>
example would now spread far and wide over the <lb/>
American world, and be epoch-making in the matter <lb/>
of moral regeneration. And so on, and so on.</p>
<p>By the end of a week things had quieted down <lb/>
again; the wild intoxication of pride and joy had <lb/>
sobered to a soft, sweet, silent delight&#x2014;a sort of <lb/>
deep, nameless, unutterable content. All faces <lb/>
bore a look of peaceful, holy happiness.</p>
<p>Then a change came. It was a gradual change: <lb/>
so gradual that its beginnings were hardly noticed; <lb/>
maybe were not noticed at all, except by Jack Hal- <lb/>
liday, who always noticed everything; and always <lb/>
made fun of it, too, no matter what it was. He <lb/>
began to throw out chaffing remarks about people <lb/>
not looking quite so happy as they did a day or two <lb/>
ago; and next he claimed that the new aspect was <lb/>
deepening to positive sadness; next, that it was tak- <lb/>
ing on a sick look; and finally he said that everybody <lb/>
was become so moody, thoughtful, and absent- <lb/>
minded that he could rob the meanest man in town <lb/>
of a cent out of the bottom of his breeches pocket <lb/>
and not disturb his revery.</p>
<p>At this stage&#x2014;or at about this stage&#x2014;a saying <lb/>
like this was dropped at bedtime&#x2014;with a sigh, <lb/>
usually&#x2014;by the head of each of the nineteen <lb/>
principal households: "Ah, what <i>could</i> have been <lb/>
the remark that Goodson made?"</p>
<pb n="92"/>
<p>And straightway&#x2014;with a shudder&#x2014;came this, <lb/>
from the man's wife:</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>don't!</i> What horrible thing are you <lb/>
mulling in your mind? Put it away from you, for <lb/>
God's sake!"</p>
<p>But that question was wrung from those men <lb/>
again the next night&#x2014;and got the same retort. <lb/>
But weaker.</p>
<p>And the third night the men uttered the question <lb/>
yet again&#x2014;with anguish, and absently. This time <lb/>
&#x2014;and the following night&#x2014;the wives fidgeted <lb/>
feebly, and tried to say something. But didn't.</p>
<p>And the night after that they found their tongues <lb/>
and responded&#x2014;longingly,</p>
<p>"Oh, if we <i>could</i> only guess!"</p>
<p>Halliday's comments grew daily more and more <lb/>
sparklingly disagreeable and disparaging. He went <lb/>
diligently about, laughing at the town, individually <lb/>
and in mass. But his laugh was the only one left in <lb/>
the village: it fell upon a hollow and mournful <lb/>
vacancy and emptiness. Not even a smile was <lb/>
findable anywhere. Halliday carried a cigar-box <lb/>
around on a tripod, playing that it was a camera, <lb/>
and halted all passers and aimed the thing and said, <lb/>
"Ready!&#x2014;now look pleasant, please," but not <lb/>
even this capital joke could surprise the dreary faces <lb/>
into any softening.</p>
<p>So three weeks passed&#x2014;one week was left. It <lb/>
was Saturday evening&#x2014;after supper. Instead of <lb/>
the aforetime Saturday-evening flutter and bustle <lb/>
<pb n="93"/>
and shopping and larking, the streets were empty <lb/>
and desolate. Richards and his old wife sat apart <lb/>
in their little parlor&#x2014;miserable and thinking. This <lb/>
was become their evening habit now: the lifelong <lb/>
habit which had preceded it, of reading, knitting, <lb/>
and contented chat, or receiving or paying neigh- <lb/>
borly calls, was dead and gone and forgotten, ages <lb/>
ago&#x2014;two or three weeks ago; nobody talked now, <lb/>
nobody read, nobody visited&#x2014;the whole village sat <lb/>
at home, sighing, worrying, silent. Trying to guess <lb/>
out that remark.</p>
<p>The postman left a letter. Richards glanced <lb/>
listlessly at the superscription and the postmark&#x2014; <lb/>
unfamiliar, both&#x2014;and tossed the letter on the table <lb/>
and resumed his might-have-beens and his hopeless <lb/>
dull miseries where he had left them off. Two or <lb/>
three hours later his wife got wearily up and was <lb/>
going away to bed without a good-night&#x2014;custom <lb/>
now&#x2014;but she stopped near the letter and eyed it <lb/>
awhile with a dead interest, then broke it open, and <lb/>
began to skim it over. Richards, sitting there with <lb/>
his chair tilted back against the wall and his chin <lb/>
between his knees, heard something fall. It was his <lb/>
wife. He sprang to her side, but she cried out:</p>
<p>"Leave me alone, I am too happy. Read the <lb/>
letter&#x2014;read it!"</p>
<p>He did. He devoured it, his brain reeling. The <lb/>
letter was from a distant State, and it said:</p>
<quotedLetter>
<p><i>"I am a stranger to you, but no matter: I have something to tell. <lb/>
I have just arrived home from Mexico, and learned about that episode.</i> <lb/>
<pb n="94"/>
<i>Of course you do not know who made that remark, but I know, and I <lb/>
am the only person living who does know. It was</i> <smcap>Goodson</smcap>. <i>I knew <lb/>
him well, many years ago. I passed through your village that very <lb/>
night, and was his guest till the midnight train came along. I over- <lb/>
heard him make that remark to the stranger in the dark&#x2014;it was in <lb/>
Hale Alley. He and I talked of it the rest of the way home, and while <lb/>
smoking in his house. He mentioned many of your villagers in the <lb/>
course of his talk&#x2014;most of them in a very uncomplimentary way, but <lb/>
two or three favorably; among these latter yourself. I say 'favorably' <lb/>
&#x2014;nothing stronger. I remember his saying he did not actually</i> <smcap>like</smcap> <lb/>
<i>any person in the town&#x2014;not one; but that you&#x2014;I</i> <smcap>think</smcap> <i>he said <lb/>
you&#x2014;am almost sure&#x2014;had done him a very great service once, pos- <lb/>
sibly without knowing the full value of it, and he wished he had a <lb/>
fortune, he would leave it to you when he died, and a curse apiece for <lb/>
the rest of the citizens. Now, then, if it was you that did him that <lb/>
service, you are his legitimate heir, and entitled to the sack of gold. I <lb/>
know that I can trust to your honor and honesty, for in a citizen of <lb/>
Hadleyburg these virtues are an unfailing inheritance, and so I am <lb/>
going to reveal to you the remark, well satisfied that if you are not the <lb/>
right man you will seek and find the right one and see that poor Good- <lb/>
son's debt of gratitude for the service referred to is paid. This is the <lb/>
remark:</i> '<smcap>You are far from being a bad man: go, and reform</smcap>.'</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward, the money is ours, and I am so <lb/>
grateful, <i>oh</i>, so grateful&#x2014;kiss me, dear, it's forever <lb/>
since we kissed&#x2014;and we needed it so&#x2014;the money <lb/>
&#x2014;and now you are free of Pinkerton and his bank, <lb/>
and nobody's slave any more; it seems to me I <lb/>
could fly for joy."</p>
<p>It was a happy half-hour that the couple spent <lb/>
there on the settee caressing each other; it was the <lb/>
old days come again&#x2014;days that had begun with <lb/>
their courtship and lasted without a break till the <lb/>
stranger brought the deadly money. By and by the <lb/>
wife said:</p>
<pb n="95"/>
<p>"Oh, Edward, how lucky it was you did him that <lb/>
grand service, poor Goodson! I never liked him, <lb/>
but I love him now. And it was fine and beautiful <lb/>
of you never to mention it or brag about it." <lb/>
Then, with a touch of reproach, "But you ought <lb/>
to have told <i>me</i>, Edward, you ought to have told <lb/>
your wife, you know."</p>
<p>"Well, I&#x2014;er&#x2014;well, Mary, you see&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Now stop hemming and hawing, and tell me <lb/>
about it, Edward. I always loved you, and now <lb/>
I'm proud of you. Everybody believes there was <lb/>
only one good generous soul in this village, and <lb/>
now it turns out that you&#x2014;Edward, why don't <lb/>
you tell me?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;er&#x2014;er&#x2014; Why, Mary, I can't!"</p>
<p>"You <i>can't? Why</i> can't you?"</p>
<p>"You see, he&#x2014;well, he&#x2014;he made me promise <lb/>
I wouldn't."</p>
<p>The wife looked him over, and said, very slowly,</p>
<p>"Made&#x2014;you&#x2014;promise? Edward, what do <lb/>
you tell me that for?"</p>
<p>"Mary, do you think I would lie?"</p>
<p>She was troubled and silent for a moment, then <lb/>
she laid her hand within his and said:</p>
<p>"No &#x2026; no. We have wandered far enough <lb/>
from our bearings&#x2014;God spare us that! In all <lb/>
your life you have never uttered a lie. But now&#x2014; <lb/>
now that the foundations of things seem to be crum- <lb/>
bling from under us, we&#x2014;we&#x2014;" She lost her <lb/>
voice for a moment, then said, brokenly, "Lead us <lb/>
<pb n="96"/>
not into temptation&#x2026;. I think you made the <lb/>
promise, Edward. Let it rest so. Let us keep <lb/>
away from that ground. Now&#x2014;that is all gone <lb/>
by; let us be happy again; it is no time for clouds."</p>
<p>Edward found it something of an effort to comply, <lb/>
for his mind kept wandering&#x2014;trying to remember <lb/>
what the service was that he had done Goodson.</p>
<p>The couple lay awake the most of the night, Mary <lb/>
happy and busy, Edward busy but not so happy. <lb/>
Mary was planning what she would do with the <lb/>
money. Edward was trying to recall that service. <lb/>
At first his conscience was sore on account of the <lb/>
lie he had told Mary&#x2014;if it was a lie. After much <lb/>
reflection&#x2014;suppose it <i>was</i> a lie? What then? <lb/>
Was it such a great matter? Aren't we always <lb/>
<i>acting</i> lies? Then why not <i>tell</i> them? Look at <lb/>
Mary&#x2014;look what she had done. While he was <lb/>
hurrying off on his honest errand, what was she <lb/>
doing? Lamenting because the papers hadn't been <lb/>
destroyed and the money kept! Is theft better <lb/>
than lying?</p>
<p><i>That</i> point lost its sting&#x2014;the lie dropped into <lb/>
the background and left comfort behind it. The <lb/>
next point came to the front: <i>Had</i> he rendered that <lb/>
service? Well, here was Goodson's own evidence <lb/>
as reported in Stephenson's letter; there could be <lb/>
no better evidence than that&#x2014;it was even <i>proof</i> <lb/>
that he had rendered it. Of course. So that point <lb/>
was settled&#x2026;. No, not quite. He recalled with <lb/>
a wince that this unknown Mr. Stephenson was just <lb/>
<pb n="97"/>
a trifle unsure as to whether the performer of it was <lb/>
Richards or some other&#x2014;and, oh dear, he had <lb/>
put Richards on his honor! He must himself <lb/>
decide whither that money must go&#x2014;and Mr. <lb/>
Stephenson was not doubting that if he was the <lb/>
wrong man he would go honorably and find the <lb/>
right one. Oh, it was odious to put a man in such <lb/>
a situation&#x2014;ah, why couldn't Stephenson have left <lb/>
out that doubt! What did he want to intrude that <lb/>
for?</p>
<p>Further reflection. How did it happen that <lb/>
<i>Richards's</i> name remained in Stephenson's mind as <lb/>
indicating the right man, and not some other man's <lb/>
name? That looked good. Yes, that looked very <lb/>
good. In fact, it went on looking better and better, <lb/>
straight along&#x2014;until by and by it grew into posi- <lb/>
tive <i>proof</i>. And then Richards put the matter at <lb/>
once out of his mind, for he had a private instinct <lb/>
that a proof once established is better left so.</p>
<p>He was feeling reasonably comfortable now, but <lb/>
there was still one other detail that kept pushing <lb/>
itself on his notice: of course he had done that ser- <lb/>
vice&#x2014;that was settled; but what <i>was</i> that service? <lb/>
He must recall it&#x2014;he would not go to sleep till he <lb/>
had recalled it; it would make his peace of mind <lb/>
perfect. And so he thought and thought. He <lb/>
thought of a dozen things&#x2014;possible services, even <lb/>
probable services&#x2014;but none of them seemed ade- <lb/>
quate, none of them seemed large enough, none of <lb/>
them seemed worth the money&#x2014;worth the fortune <lb/>
<pb n="98"/>
Goodson had wished he could leave in his will. And <lb/>
besides, he couldn't remember having done them, <lb/>
anyway. Now, then&#x2014;now, then&#x2014;what <i>kind</i> of <lb/>
a service would it be that would make a man so in- <lb/>
ordinately grateful? Ah&#x2014;the saving of his soul! <lb/>
That must be it. Yes, he could remember, now, <lb/>
how he once set himself the task of converting <lb/>
Goodson, and labored at it as much as&#x2014;he was <lb/>
going to say three months; but upon closer exam- <lb/>
ination it shrunk to a month, then to a week, then <lb/>
to a day, then to nothing. Yes, he remembered <lb/>
now, and with unwelcome vividness, that Goodson <lb/>
had told him to go to thunder and mind his own <lb/>
business&#x2014;<i>he</i> wasn't hankering to follow Hadley- <lb/>
burg to heaven!</p>
<p>So that solution was a failure&#x2014;he hadn't saved <lb/>
Goodson's soul. Richards was discouraged. Then <lb/>
after a little came another idea: had he saved Good- <lb/>
son's property? No, that wouldn't do&#x2014;he hadn't <lb/>
any. His life? That is it! Of course. Why, he <lb/>
might have thought of it before. This time he was <lb/>
on the right track, sure. His imagination-mill was <lb/>
hard at work in a minute, now.</p>
<p>Thereafter during a stretch of two exhausting <lb/>
hours he was busy saving Goodson's life. He <lb/>
saved it in all kinds of difficult and perilous ways. <lb/>
In every case he got it saved satisfactorily up to a <lb/>
certain point; then, just as he was beginning to get <lb/>
well persuaded that it had really happened, a <lb/>
troublesome detail would turn up which made the <lb/>
<pb n="99"/>
whole thing impossible. As in the matter of drown- <lb/>
ing, for instance. In that case he had swum out <lb/>
and tugged Goodson ashore in an unconscious <lb/>
state with a great crowd looking on and applauding, <lb/>
but when he had got it all thought out and was just <lb/>
beginning to remember all about it, a whole swarm <lb/>
of disqualifying details arrived on the ground: the <lb/>
town would have known of the circumstance, Mary <lb/>
would have known of it, it would glare like a lime- <lb/>
light in his own memory instead of being an incon- <lb/>
spicuous service which he had possibly rendered <lb/>
"without knowing its full value." And at this <lb/>
point he remembered that he couldn't swim, any- <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>Ah&#x2014;<i>there</i> was a point which he had been over- <lb/>
looking from the start: it had to be a service which <lb/>
he had rendered "possibly without knowing the full <lb/>
value of it." Why, really, that ought to be an easy <lb/>
hunt&#x2014;much easier than those others. And sure <lb/>
enough, by and by he found it. Goodson, years <lb/>
and years ago, came near marrying a very sweet <lb/>
and pretty girl, named Nancy Hewitt, but in some <lb/>
way or other the match had been broken off; the <lb/>
girl died, Goodson remained a bachelor, and by <lb/>
and by became a soured one and a frank despiser <lb/>
of the human species. Soon after the girl's death <lb/>
the village found out, or thought it had found out, <lb/>
that she carried a spoonful of negro blood in her <lb/>
veins. Richards worked at these details a good <lb/>
while, and in the end he thought he remembered <lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
things concerning them which must have gotten <lb/>
mislaid in his memory through long neglect. He <lb/>
seemed to dimly remember that it was <i>he</i> that found <lb/>
out about the negro blood; that it was he that told <lb/>
the village; that the village told Goodson where <lb/>
they got it; that he thus saved Goodson from <lb/>
marrying the tainted girl; that he had done him this <lb/>
great service "without knowing the full value of <lb/>
it," in fact without knowing that he <i>was</i> doing it; <lb/>
but that Goodson knew the value of it, and what a <lb/>
narrow escape he had had, and so went to his grave <lb/>
grateful to his benefactor and wishing he had a for- <lb/>
tune to leave him. It was all clear and simple now, <lb/>
and the more he went over it the more luminous and <lb/>
certain it grew; and at last, when he nestled to sleep <lb/>
satisfied and happy, he remembered the whole thing <lb/>
just as if it had been yesterday. In fact, he dimly <lb/>
remembered Goodson's <i>telling</i> him his gratitude <lb/>
once. Meantime Mary had spent six thousand dol- <lb/>
lars on a new house for herself and a pair of slippers <lb/>
for her pastor, and then had fallen peacefully to <lb/>
rest.</p>
<p>That same Saturday evening the postman had de- <lb/>
livered a letter to each of the other principal citizens <lb/>
&#x2014;nineteen letters in all. No two of the envelopes <lb/>
were alike, and no two of the superscriptions were <lb/>
in the same hand, but the letters inside were just <lb/>
like each other in every detail but one. They were <lb/>
exact copies of the letter received by Richards&#x2014; <lb/>
handwriting and all&#x2014;and were all signed by Stephen- <lb/>
<pb n="101"/>
son, but in place of Richards's name each receiver's <lb/>
own name appeared.</p>
<p>All night long eighteen principal citizens did what <lb/>
their caste-brother Richards was doing at the same <lb/>
time&#x2014;they put in their energies trying to remember <lb/>
what notable service it was that they had uncon- <lb/>
sciously done Barclay Goodson. In no case was it <lb/>
a holiday job; still they succeeded.</p>
<p>And while they were at this work, which was diffi- <lb/>
cult, their wives put in the night spending the <lb/>
money, which was easy. During that one night the <lb/>
nineteen wives spent an average of seven thousand <lb/>
dollars each out of the forty thousand in the sack&#x2014; <lb/>
a hundred and thirty-three thousand altogether.</p>
<p>Next day there was a surprise for Jack Halliday. <lb/>
He noticed that the faces of the nineteen chief <lb/>
citizens and their wives bore that expression of <lb/>
peaceful and holy happiness again. He could not <lb/>
understand it, neither was he able to invent any <lb/>
remarks about it that could damage it or disturb it. <lb/>
And so it was his turn to be dissatisfied with life. <lb/>
His private guesses at the reasons for the happiness <lb/>
failed in all instances, upon examination. When he <lb/>
met Mrs. Wilcox and noticed the placid ecstasy in <lb/>
her face, he said to himself, "Her cat has had <lb/>
kittens"&#x2014;and went and asked the cook: it was not <lb/>
so; the cook had detected the happiness, but did not <lb/>
know the cause. When Halliday found the duplicate <lb/>
ecstasy in the face of "Shadbelly" Billson (village <lb/>
nickname), he was sure some neighbor of Billson's <lb/>
<pb n="102"/>
had broken his leg, but inquiry showed that this had <lb/>
not happened. The subdued ecstasy in Gregory <lb/>
Yates's face could mean but one thing&#x2014;he was a <lb/>
mother-in-law short: it was another mistake. "And <lb/>
Pinkerton&#x2014;Pinkerton&#x2014;he has collected ten cents <lb/>
that he thought he was going to lose." And so on, <lb/>
and so on. In some cases the guesses had to re- <lb/>
main in doubt, in the others they proved distinct <lb/>
errors. In the end Halliday said to himself, "Any- <lb/>
way it foots up that there's nineteen Hadleyburg <lb/>
families temporarily in heaven: I don't know how it <lb/>
happened; I only know Providence is off duty <lb/>
to-day."</p>
<p>An architect and builder from the next State had <lb/>
lately ventured to set up a small business in this <lb/>
unpromising village, and his sign had now been <lb/>
hanging out a week. Not a customer yet; he was a <lb/>
discouraged man, and sorry he had come. But his <lb/>
weather changed suddenly now. First one and then <lb/>
another chief citizen's wife said to him privately:</p>
<p>"Come to my house Monday week&#x2014;but say noth- <lb/>
ing about it for the present. We think of building."</p>
<p>He got eleven invitations that day. That night <lb/>
he wrote his daughter and broke off her match with <lb/>
her student. He said she could marry a mile higher <lb/>
than that.</p>
<p>Pinkerton the banker and two or three other well- <lb/>
to-do men planned country-seats&#x2014;but waited. That <lb/>
kind don't count their chickens until they are <lb/>
hatched.</p>
<pb n="103"/>
<p>The Wilsons devised a grand new thing&#x2014;a fancy- <lb/>
dress ball. They made no actual promises, but told <lb/>
all their acquaintanceship in confidence that they <lb/>
were thinking the matter over and thought they <lb/>
should give it&#x2014;"and if we do, you will be invited, <lb/>
of course." People were surprised, and said, one <lb/>
to another, "Why, they are crazy, those poor <lb/>
Wilsons, they can't afford it." Several among the <lb/>
nineteen said privately to their husbands, "It is a <lb/>
good idea: we will keep still till their cheap thing is <lb/>
over, then <i>we</i> will give one that will make it sick."</p>
<p>The days drifted along, and the bill of future <lb/>
squanderings rose higher and higher, wilder and <lb/>
wilder, more and more foolish and reckless. It <lb/>
began to look as if every member of the nineteen <lb/>
would not only spend his whole forty thousand dol- <lb/>
lars before receiving-day, but be actually in debt by <lb/>
the time he got the money. In some cases light- <lb/>
headed people did not stop with planning to spend, <lb/>
they really spent&#x2014;on credit. They bought land, <lb/>
mortgages, farms, speculative stocks, fine clothes, <lb/>
horses, and various other things, paid down the <lb/>
bonus, and made themselves liable for the rest&#x2014;at <lb/>
ten days. Presently the sober second thought came, <lb/>
and Halliday noticed that a ghastly anxiety was be- <lb/>
ginning to show up in a good many faces. Again <lb/>
he was puzzled, and didn't know what to make of <lb/>
it. "The Wilcox kittens aren't dead, for they <lb/>
weren't born; nobody's broken a leg; there's no <lb/>
shrinkage in mother-in-laws; <i>nothing</i> has happened <lb/>
&#x2014;it is an unsolvable mystery."</p>
<pb n="104"/>
<p>There was another puzzled man, too&#x2014;the Rev. <lb/>
Mr. Burgess. For days, wherever he went, people <lb/>
seemed to follow him or to be watching out for him; <lb/>
and if he ever found himself in a retired spot, a <lb/>
member of the nineteen would be sure to appear, <lb/>
thrust an envelope privately into his hand, whisper <lb/>
"To be opened at the town-hall Friday evening," <lb/>
then vanish away like a guilty thing. He was ex- <lb/>
pecting that there might be one claimant for the sack, <lb/>
&#x2014;doubtful, however, Goodson being dead,&#x2014;but it <lb/>
never occurred to him that all this crowd might be <lb/>
claimants. When the great Friday came at last, he <lb/>
found that he had nineteen envelopes.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="III">
<head>III</head>
<p>The town-hall had never looked finer. The plat- <lb/>
form at the end of it was backed by a showy draping <lb/>
of flags; at intervals along the walls were festoons of <lb/>
flags; the gallery fronts were clothed in flags; the <lb/>
supporting columns were swathed in flags; all this <lb/>
was to impress the stranger, for he would be there <lb/>
in considerable force, and in a large degree he would <lb/>
be connected with the press. The house was full. <lb/>
The 412 fixed seats were occupied; also the 68 <lb/>
extra chairs which had been packed into the aisles; <lb/>
the steps of the platform were occupied; some dis- <lb/>
tinguished strangers were given seats on the plat- <lb/>
form; at the horseshoe of tables which fenced the <lb/>
front and sides of the platform sat a strong force of <lb/>
special correspondents who had come from every- <lb/>
<pb n="105"/>
where. It was the best-dressed house the town had <lb/>
ever produced. There were some tolerably expen- <lb/>
sive toilets there, and in several cases the ladies who <lb/>
wore them had the look of being unfamiliar with that <lb/>
kind of clothes. At least the town thought they had <lb/>
that look, but the notion could have arisen from the <lb/>
town's knowledge of the fact that these ladies had <lb/>
never inhabited such clothes before.</p>
<p>The gold-sack stood on a little table at the front <lb/>
of the platform where all the house could see it. <lb/>
The bulk of the house gazed at it with a burning in- <lb/>
terest, a mouth-watering interest, a wistful and <lb/>
pathetic interest; a minority of nineteen couples <lb/>
gazed at it tenderly, lovingly, proprietarily, and the <lb/>
male half of this minority kept saying over to them- <lb/>
selves the moving little impromptu speeches of <lb/>
thankfulness for the audience's applause and con- <lb/>
gratulations which they were presently going to get <lb/>
up and deliver. Every now and then one of these <lb/>
got a piece of paper out of his vest pocket and <lb/>
privately glanced at it to refresh his memory.</p>
<p>Of course there was a buzz of conversation going <lb/>
on&#x2014;there always is; but at last when the Rev. Mr. <lb/>
Burgess rose and laid his hand on the sack he could <lb/>
hear his microbes gnaw, the place was so still. He <lb/>
related the curious history of the sack, then went on <lb/>
to speak in warm terms of Hadleyburg's old and <lb/>
well-earned reputation for spotless honesty, and of <lb/>
the town's just pride in this reputation. He said that <lb/>
this reputation was a treasure of priceless value; <lb/>
<pb n="106"/>
that under Providence its value had now become <lb/>
inestimably enhanced, for the recent episode had <lb/>
spread this fame far and wide, and thus had focused <lb/>
the eyes of the American world upon this village, <lb/>
and mad its name for all time, as he hoped and <lb/>
believed, a synonym for commercial incorruptibility. <lb/>
[<i>Applause</i>.] "And who is to be the guardian of <lb/>
this noble treasure&#x2014;the community as a whole? <lb/>
No! The responsibility is individual, not communal. <lb/>
From this day forth each and every one of you is in <lb/>
his own person its special guardian, and individually <lb/>
responsible that no harm shall come to it. Do you <lb/>
&#x2014;does each of you&#x2014;accept this great trust? <lb/>
[<i>Tumultuous assent</i>.] Then all is well. Transmit <lb/>
it to your children and to your children's children. <lb/>
To-day your purity is beyond reproach&#x2014;see to it <lb/>
that it shall remain so. To-day there is not a <lb/>
person in your community who could be beguiled <lb/>
to touch a penny not his own&#x2014;see to it that you <lb/>
abide in this grace. ["<i>We will! we will!</i>"] <lb/>
This is not the place to make comparisons between <lb/>
ourselves and other communities&#x2014;some of them <lb/>
ungracious toward us; they have their ways, we <lb/>
have ours; let us be content. [<i>Applause</i>.] I am <lb/>
done. Under my hand, my friends, rests a stranger's <lb/>
eloquent recognition of what we are; through him <lb/>
the world will always henceforth know what we are. <lb/>
We do not know who he is, but in your name I <lb/>
utter your gratitude, and ask you to raise your <lb/>
voices in endorsement."</p>
<pb n="107"/>
<p>The house rose in a body and made the walls <lb/>
quake with the thunders of its thankfulness for the <lb/>
space of a long minute. Then it sat down, and Mr. <lb/>
Burgess took an envelope out of his pocket. The <lb/>
house held its breath while he slit the envelope open <lb/>
and took from it a slip of paper. He read its con- <lb/>
tents&#x2014;slowly and impressively&#x2014;the audience <lb/>
listening with tranced attention to this magic docu- <lb/>
ment, each of whose words stood for an ingot of <lb/>
gold:</p>
<p>"'<i>The remark which I made to the distressed <lb/>
stranger was this: "You are very far from being a <lb/>
bad man: go, and reform."'"</i> Then he continued:</p>
<p>"We shall know in a moment now whether the re- <lb/>
mark here quoted corresponds with the one con- <lb/>
cealed in the sack; and if that shall prove to be so <lb/>
&#x2014;and it undoubtedly will&#x2014;this sack of gold be- <lb/>
longs to a fellow-citizen who will henceforth stand <lb/>
before the nation as the symbol of the special virtue <lb/>
which has made our town famous throughout the <lb/>
land&#x2014;Mr. Billson!"</p>
<p>The house had gotten itself all ready to burst into <lb/>
the proper tornado of applause; but instead of <lb/>
doing it, it seemed stricken with a paralysis; there <lb/>
was a deep hush for a moment or two, then a wave <lb/>
of whispered murmurs swept the place&#x2014;of about <lb/>
this tenor: "<i>Billson!</i> oh, come, this is <i>too</i> thin! <lb/>
Twenty dollars to a stranger&#x2014;or <i>anybody</i>&#x2014;<i>Bill- <lb/>
son!</i> tell it to the marines!" And now at this <lb/>
point the house caught its breath all of a sudden in <lb/>
<pb n="108"/>
a new access of astonishment, for it discovered that <lb/>
whereas in one part of the hall Deacon Billson was <lb/>
standing up with his head meekly bowed, in another <lb/>
part of it Lawyer Wilson was doing the same. <lb/>
There was a wondering silence now for a while.</p>
<p>Everybody was puzzled, and nineteen couples <lb/>
were surprised and indignant.</p>
<p>Billson and Wilson turned and stared at each <lb/>
other. Billson asked, bitingly,</p>
<p>"Why do <i>you</i> rise, Mr. Wilson?"</p>
<p>"Because I have a right to. Perhaps you will be <lb/>
good enough to explain to the house why <i>you</i> rise?"</p>
<p>"With great pleasure. Because I wrote that <lb/>
paper."</p>
<p>"It is an impudent falsity! I wrote it myself."</p>
<p>It was Burgess's turn to be paralyzed. He stood <lb/>
looking vacantly at first one of the men and then the <lb/>
other, and did not seem to know what to do. The <lb/>
house was stupefied. Lawyer Wilson spoke up, <lb/>
now, and said,</p>
<p>"I ask the Chair to read the name signed to that <lb/>
paper."</p>
<p>That brought the Chair to itself, and it read out <lb/>
the name,</p>
<p>"'John Wharton <i>Billson</i>.'"</p>
<p>"There!" shouted Billson, "what have you got <lb/>
to say for yourself, now? And what kind of <lb/>
apology are you going to make to me and to this <lb/>
insulted house for the imposture which you have <lb/>
attempted to play here?"</p>
<pb n="109"/>
<p>"No apologies are due, sir; and as for the rest <lb/>
of it, I publicly charge you with pilfering my note <lb/>
from Mr. Burgess and substituting a copy of it <lb/>
signed with your own name. There is no other way <lb/>
by which you could have gotten hold of the test- <lb/>
remark; I alone, of living men, possessed the secret <lb/>
of its wording."</p>
<p>There was likely to be a scandalous state of things <lb/>
if this went on; everybody noticed with distress that <lb/>
the short-hand scribes were scribbling like mad; <lb/>
many people were crying "Chair, Chair! Order! <lb/>
order!" Burgess rapped with his gavel, and said:</p>
<p>"Let us not forget the proprieties due. There <lb/>
has evidently been a mistake somewhere, but surely <lb/>
that is all. If Mr. Wilson gave me an envelope&#x2014; <lb/>
and I remember now that he did&#x2014;I still have it."</p>
<p>He took one out of his pocket, opened it, glanced <lb/>
at it, looked surprised and worried, and stood silent <lb/>
a few moments. Then he waved his hand in a <lb/>
wandering and mechanical way, and made an effort <lb/>
or two to say something, then gave it up, despond- <lb/>
ently. Several voices cried out:</p>
<p>"Read it! read it! What is it?"</p>
<p>So he began in a dazed and sleep-walker fashion:</p>
<p>"'<i>The remark which I made to the unhappy stran- <lb/>
ger was this:</i> "<i>You are far from being a bad man</i>. <lb/>
[The house gazed at him, marveling.] <i>Go, and <lb/>
reform</i>."' [<i>Murmurs:</i> "Amazing! what can this <lb/>
mean?"] This one," said the Chair, "is signed <lb/>
Thurlow G. Wilson."</p>
<pb n="110"/>
<p>"There!" cried Wilson, "I reckon that settles <lb/>
it! I knew perfectly well my note was purloined."</p>
<p>"Purloined!" retorted Billson. "I'll let you <lb/>
know that neither you nor any man of your kidney <lb/>
must venture to&#x2014;"</p>
<sp><speaker><i>The Chair</i>.</speaker><p>"Order, gentlemen, order! Take <lb/>
your seats, both of you, please."</p>
<p>They obeyed, shaking their heads and grumbling <lb/>
angrily. The house was profoundly puzzled; it <lb/>
did not know what to do with this curious emer- <lb/>
gency. Presently Thompson got up. Thompson <lb/>
was the hatter. He would have liked to be a Nine- <lb/>
teener; but such was not for him: his stock of hats <lb/>
was not considerable enough for the position. He <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Chairman, if I may be permitted to make a <lb/>
suggestion, can both of these gentlemen be right? <lb/>
I put it to you, sir, can both have happened to say <lb/>
the very same words to the stranger? It seems to <lb/>
me&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The tanner got up and interrupted him. The <lb/>
tanner was a disgruntled man; he believed himself <lb/>
entitled to be a Nineteener, but he couldn't get <lb/>
recognition. It made him a little unpleasant in his <lb/>
ways and speech. Said he:</p>
<p>"Sho, <i>that's</i> not the point! <i>That</i> could happen <lb/>
&#x2014;twice in a hundred years&#x2014;but not the other <lb/>
thing. <i>Neither</i> of them gave the twenty dollars!"</p>
<p>[<i>A ripple of applause</i>.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Billson</i>.</speaker><p>"<i>I</i> did!"</p></sp>
<pb n="111"/>
<sp><speaker><i>Wilson</i>.</speaker><p>"<i>I</i> did!"</p>
<p>Then each accused the other of pilfering.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Chair</i>.</speaker><p>"Order! Sit down, if you please <lb/>
&#x2014;both of you. Neither of the notes has been out <lb/>
of my possession at any moment."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A Voice</i>.</speaker><p>"Good&#x2014;that settles <i>that!</i>"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Tanner</i>.</speaker><p>"Mr. Chairman, one thing is now <lb/>
plain: one of these men has been eavesdropping un- <lb/>
der the other one's bed, and filching family secrets. <lb/>
If it is not unparliamentary to suggest it, I will re- <lb/>
mark that both are equal to it. [<i>The Chair</i>. "Order! <lb/>
order!"] I withdraw the remark, sir, and will con- <lb/>
fine myself to suggesting that <i>if</i> one of them has <lb/>
overheard the other reveal the test-remark to his <lb/>
wife, we shall catch him now."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A Voice</i>.</speaker><p>"How?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Tanner</i>.</speaker><p>"Easily. The two have not <lb/>
quoted the remark in exactly the same words. You <lb/>
would have noticed that, if there hadn't been a con- <lb/>
siderable stretch of time and an exciting quarrel in- <lb/>
serted between the two readings."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A Voice</i>.</speaker><p>"Name the difference."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Tanner</i>.</speaker><p>"The word <i>very</i> is in Billson's <lb/>
note, and not in the other."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Many Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"That's so&#x2014;he's right!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Tanner</i>.</speaker><p>"And so, if the Chair will examine <lb/>
the test-remark in the sack, we shall know which of <lb/>
these two frauds&#x2014; [<i>The Chair</i>. "Order!"]&#x2014; <lb/>
which of these two adventurers&#x2014; [<i>The Chair</i>. <lb/>
"Order! order!"]&#x2014;which of these two gentlemen <lb/>
<pb n="112"/>
&#x2014;[<i>laughter and applause</i>]&#x2014;is entitled to wear the <lb/>
belt as being the first dishonest blatherskite ever <lb/>
bred in this town&#x2014;which he has dishonored, and <lb/>
which will be a sultry place for him from now out!" <lb/>
[<i>Vigorous applause</i>.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Many Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"Open it!&#x2014;open the sack!"</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess made a slit in the sack, slid his hand <lb/>
in and brought out an envelope. In it were a <lb/>
couple of folded notes. He said:</p>
<p>"One of these is marked, 'Not to be examined <lb/>
until all written communications which have been <lb/>
addressed to the Chair&#x2014;if any&#x2014;shall have been <lb/>
read.' The other is marked '<i>The Test</i>.' Allow <lb/>
me. It is worded&#x2014;to wit:</p>
<p>"'I do not require that the first half of the re- <lb/>
mark which was made to me by my benefactor shall <lb/>
be quoted with exactness, for it was not striking, <lb/>
and could be forgotten; but its closing fifteen words <lb/>
are quite striking, and I think easily rememberable; <lb/>
unless <i>these</i> shall be accurately reproduced, let the <lb/>
applicant be regarded as an impostor. My bene- <lb/>
factor began by saying he seldom gave advice to any <lb/>
one, but that it always bore the hall-mark of high <lb/>
value when he did give it. Then he said this&#x2014;and <lb/>
it has never faded from my memory: "<i>You are far <lb/>
from being a bad man</i>&#x2014;"'"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Fifty Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"That settles it&#x2014;the money's <lb/>
Wilson's! Wilson! Wilson! Speech! Speech!"</p>
<p>People jumped up and crowded around Wilson, <lb/>
wringing his hand and congratulating fervently&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="113"/>
meantime the Chair was hammering with the gavel <lb/>
and shouting:</p>
<p>"Order, gentlemen! Order! Order! Let me <lb/>
finish reading, please." When quiet was restored, <lb/>
the reading was resumed&#x2014;as follows:</p>
<p>"'"<i>Go, and reform&#x2014;or, mark my words&#x2014;some <lb/>
day, for your sins, you will die and go to hell or Had- <lb/>
leyburg</i>&#x2014;<smcap>try and make it the former</smcap>."'"</p>
<p>A ghastly silence followed. First an angry cloud <lb/>
began to settle darkly upon the faces of the citizen- <lb/>
ship; after a pause the cloud began to rise, and a <lb/>
tickled expression tried to take its place; tried so <lb/>
hard that it was only kept under with great and <lb/>
painful difficulty; the reporters, the Brixtonites, <lb/>
and other strangers bent their heads down and <lb/>
shielded their faces with their hands, and managed <lb/>
to hold in by main strength and heroic courtesy. <lb/>
At this most inopportune time burst upon the still- <lb/>
ness the roar of a solitary voice&#x2014;Jack Halliday's:</p>
<p>"<i>That's</i> got the hall-mark on it!"</p>
<p>Then the house let go, strangers and all. Even <lb/>
Mr. Burgess's gravity broke down presently, then <lb/>
the audience considered itself officially absolved from <lb/>
all restraint, and it made the most of its privilege. <lb/>
It was a good long laugh, and a tempestuously <lb/>
whole-hearted one, but it ceased at last&#x2014;long <lb/>
enough for Mr. Burgess to try to resume, and for <lb/>
the people to get their eyes partially wiped; then it <lb/>
broke out again; and afterward yet again; then at <lb/>
last Burgess was able to get out these serious words: <lb/></p>
<pb n="114"/>
<p>"It is useless to try to disguise the fact&#x2014;we find <lb/>
ourselves in the presence of a matter of grave import. <lb/>
It involves the honor of your town, it strikes at the <lb/>
town's good name. The difference of a single word <lb/>
between the test-remarks offered by Mr. Wilson and <lb/>
Mr. Billson was itself a serious thing, since it indi- <lb/>
cated that one or the other of these gentlemen had <lb/>
committed a theft&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The two men were sitting limp, nerveless, crushed; <lb/>
but at these words both were electrified into move- <lb/>
ment, and started to get up&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Sit down!" said the Chair, sharply, and they <lb/>
obeyed. "That, as I have said, was a serious thing. <lb/>
And it was&#x2014;but for only one of them. But the <lb/>
matter has become graver; for the honor of <i>both</i> is <lb/>
now in formidable peril. Shall I go even further, <lb/>
and say in inextricable peril? <i>Both</i> left out the <lb/>
crucial fifteen words." He paused. During several <lb/>
moments he allowed the pervading stillness to gather <lb/>
and deepen its impressive effects, then added: <lb/>
"There would seem to be but one way whereby this <lb/>
could happen. I ask these gentlemen&#x2014;Was there <lb/>
<i>collusion?&#x2014;agreement?</i>"</p>
<p>A low murmur sifted through the house; its im- <lb/>
port was, "He's got them both."</p>
<p>Billson was not used to emergencies; he sat in a <lb/>
helpless collapse. But Wilson was a lawyer. He <lb/>
struggled to his feet, pale and worried, and said:</p>
<p>"I ask the indulgence of the house while I explain <lb/>
this most painful matter. I am sorry to say what I <lb/>
<pb n="115"/>
am about to say, since it must inflict irreparable in- <lb/>
jury upon Mr. Billson, whom I have always esteemed <lb/>
and respected until now, and in whose invulnerability <lb/>
to temptation I entirely believed&#x2014;as did you all. <lb/>
But for the preservation of my own honor I must <lb/>
speak&#x2014;and with frankness. I confess with shame <lb/>
&#x2014;and I now beseech your pardon for it&#x2014;that I <lb/>
said to the ruined stranger all of the words con- <lb/>
tained in the test-remark, including the disparaging <lb/>
fifteen. [<i>Sensation</i>.] When the late publication <lb/>
was made I recalled them, and I resolved to claim <lb/>
the sack of coin, for by every right I was entitled to <lb/>
it. Now I will ask you to consider this point, and <lb/>
weigh it well: that stranger's gratitude to me that <lb/>
night knew no bounds; he said himself that he could <lb/>
find no words for it that were adequate, and that if <lb/>
he should ever be able he would repay me a thou- <lb/>
sand fold. Now, then, I ask you this: Could I ex- <lb/>
pect&#x2014;could I believe&#x2014;could I even remotely <lb/>
imagine&#x2014;that, feeling as he did, he would do so <lb/>
ungrateful a thing as to add those quite unnecessary <lb/>
fifteen words to his test?&#x2014;set a trap for me?&#x2014; <lb/>
expose me as a slanderer of my own town before my <lb/>
own people assembled in a public hall? It was pre- <lb/>
posterous; it was impossible. His test would con- <lb/>
tain only the kindly opening clause of my remark. <lb/>
Of that I had no shadow of doubt. You would <lb/>
have thought as I did. You would not have ex- <lb/>
pected a base betrayal from one whom you had be- <lb/>
friended and against whom you had committed no <lb/>
<pb n="116"/>
offense. And so, with perfect confidence, perfect <lb/>
trust, I wrote on a piece of paper the opening words <lb/>
&#x2014;ending with 'Go, and reform,'&#x2014;and signed it. <lb/>
When I was about to put it in an envelope I was <lb/>
called into my back office, and without thinking I <lb/>
left the paper lying open on my desk." He <lb/>
stopped, turned his head slowly toward Billson, <lb/>
waited a moment, then added: "I ask you to note <lb/>
this: when I returned, a little later, Mr. Billson was <lb/>
retiring by my street door." [<i>Sensation</i>.]</p>
<p>In a moment Billson was on his feet and shouting:</p>
<p>"It's a lie! It's an infamous lie!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Chair</i>.</speaker><p>"Be seated, sir! Mr. Wilson has <lb/>
the floor."</p>
<p>Billson's friends pulled him into his seat and <lb/>
quieted him, and Wilson went on:</p>
<p>"Those are the simple facts. My note was now <lb/>
lying in a different place on the table from where I <lb/>
had left it. I noticed that, but attached no import- <lb/>
ance to it, thinking a draught had blown it there. <lb/>
That Mr. Billson would read a private paper was a <lb/>
thing which could not occur to me; he was an <lb/>
honorable man, and he would be above that. If <lb/>
you will allow me to say it, I think his extra word <lb/>
'<i>very</i>' stands explained; it is attributable to a defect <lb/>
of memory. I was the only man in the world who <lb/>
could furnish here any detail of the test-remark&#x2014;by <lb/>
<i>honorable</i> means. I have finished."</p>
<p>There is nothing in the world like a persuasive <lb/>
speech to fuddle the mental apparatus and upset the <lb/>
<pb n="117"/>
convictions and debauch the emotions of an audience <lb/>
not practiced in the tricks and delusions of oratory. <lb/>
Wilson sat down victorious. The house submerged <lb/>
him in tides of approving applause; friends swarmed <lb/>
to him and shook him by the hand and congratu- <lb/>
lated him, and Billson was shouted down and not <lb/>
allowed to say a word. The Chair hammered and <lb/>
hammered with its gavel, and kept shouting,</p>
<p>"But let us proceed, gentlemen, let us proceed!"</p>
<p>At last there was a measurable degree of quiet, <lb/>
and the hatter said:</p>
<p>"But what is there to proceed with, sir, but to de- <lb/>
liver the money?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"That's it! That's it! Come forward, <lb/>
Wilson!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Hatter</i>.</speaker><p>"I move three cheers for Mr. <lb/>
Wilson, Symbol of the special virtue which&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The cheers burst forth before he could finish; and <lb/>
in the midst of them&#x2014;and in the midst of the <lb/>
clamor of the gavel also&#x2014;some enthusiasts mounted <lb/>
Wilson on a big friend's shoulder and were going to <lb/>
fetch him in triumph to the platform. The Chair's <lb/>
voice now rose above the noise&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Order! To your places! You forget that <lb/>
there is still a document to be read." When quiet <lb/>
had been restored he took up the document, and <lb/>
was going to read it, but laid it down again, saying, <lb/>
"I forgot; this is not to be read until all written <lb/>
communications received by me have first been <lb/>
read." He took an envelope out of his pocket, <lb/>
<pb n="118"/>
removed its enclosure, glanced at it&#x2014;seemed <lb/>
astonished&#x2014;held it out and gazed at it&#x2014;stared <lb/>
at it.</p>
<p>Twenty or thirty voices cried out:</p>
<p>"What is it? Read it! read it!"</p>
<p>And he did&#x2014;slowly, and wondering:</p>
<p>"'The remark which I made to the stranger&#x2014; <lb/>
[<i>Voices</i>. "Hello! how's this?"]&#x2014;was this: <lb/>
"You are far from being a bad man. [<i>Voices</i>. <lb/>
"Great Scott!"] Go, and reform."' [<i>Voice</i>. <lb/>
"Oh, saw my leg off!"] Signed by Mr. Pinker- <lb/>
ton the banker."</p>
<p>The pandemonium of delight which turned itself <lb/>
loose now was of a sort to make the judicious weep. <lb/>
Those whose withers were unwrung laughed till the <lb/>
tears ran down; the reporters, in throes of laughter, <lb/>
set down disordered pot-hooks which would never <lb/>
in the world be decipherable; and a sleeping dog <lb/>
jumped up, scared out of its wits, and barked itself <lb/>
crazy at the turmoil. All manner of cries were scat- <lb/>
tered through the din: "We're getting rich&#x2014;<i>two</i> <lb/>
Symbols of Incorruptibility!&#x2014;without counting <lb/>
Billson!" "<i>Three!</i>&#x2014;count Shadbelly in&#x2014;we <lb/>
can't have too many!" "All right&#x2014;Billson's <lb/>
elected!" "Alas, poor Wilson&#x2014;victim of <i>two</i> <lb/>
thieves!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A Powerful Voice</i>.</speaker><p>"Silence! The Chair's <lb/>
fished up something more out of its pocket."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"Hurrah! Is it something fresh? Read <lb/>
it! read! read!"</p></sp>
<pb n="119"/>
<sp><speaker><i>The Chair</i> [<i>reading</i>.]</speaker><p>"'The remark which I <lb/>
made,' etc.: "You are far from being a bad man. <lb/>
Go," etc. Signed, "Gregory Yates.""</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>Tornado of Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"Four Symbols!" "'Rah <lb/>
for Yates!" "Fish again!"</p></sp>
<p>The house was in a roaring humor now, and ready <lb/>
to get all the fun out of the occasion that might be <lb/>
in it. Several Nineteeners, looking pale and dis- <lb/>
tressed, got up and began to work their way toward <lb/>
the aisles, but a score of shouts went up:</p>
<p>"The doors, the doors&#x2014;close the doors; no In- <lb/>
corruptible shall leave this place! Sit down, every- <lb/>
body!"</p>
<p>The mandate was obeyed.</p>
<p>"Fish again! Read! read!"</p>
<p>The Chair fished again, and once more the familiar <lb/>
words began to fall from its lips&#x2014;"'You are far <lb/>
from being a bad man&#x2014;'"</p>
<p>"Name! name! What's his name?"</p>
<p>"'L. Ingoldsby Sargent.'"</p>
<p>"Five elected! Pile up the Symbols! Go on, <lb/>
go on!"</p>
<p>"'You are far from being a bad&#x2014;'"</p>
<p>"Name! name!"</p>
<p>"'Nicholas Whitworth.'"</p>
<p>"Hooray! hooray! it's a symbolical day!"</p>
<p>Somebody wailed in, and began to sing this rhyme <lb/>
(leaving out "it's") to the lovely "Mikado" tune <lb/>
of "When a man's afraid, a beautiful maid&#x2014;"; <lb/>
the audience joined in, with joy; then, just in time, <lb/>
somebody contributed another line&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="120"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And don't you this forget&#x2014;"</l>
</lg></q>
The house roared it out. A third line was at once <lb/>
furnished&#x2014; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Corruptibles far from Hadleyburg are&#x2014;"</l>
</lg></q>
The house roared that one too. As the last note <lb/>
died, Jack Halliday's voice rose high and clear, <lb/>
freighted with a final line&#x2014; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"But the Symbols are here, you bet!"</l>
</lg></q>
That was sung, with booming enthusiasm. Then the <lb/>
happy house started in at the beginning and sang <lb/>
the four lines through twice, with immense swing <lb/>
and dash, and finished up with a crashing three- <lb/>
times-three and a tiger for "Hadleyburg the Incor- <lb/>
ruptible and all Symbols of it which we shall find <lb/>
worthy to receive the hall-mark to-night."</p>
<p>Then the shoutings at the Chair began again, all <lb/>
over the place:</p>
<p>"Go on! go on! Read! read some more! <lb/>
Read all you've got!"</p>
<p>"That's it&#x2014;go on! We are winning eternal <lb/>
celebrity!"</p>
<p>A dozen men got up now and began to protest. <lb/>
They said that this farce was the work of some <lb/>
abandoned joker, and was an insult to the whole <lb/>
community. Without a doubt these signatures were <lb/>
all forgeries&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Sit down! sit down! Shut up! You are con- <lb/>
fessing. We'll find <i>your</i> names in the lot."</p>
<pb n="121"/>
<p>"Mr. Chairman, how many of those envelopes <lb/>
have you got?"</p>
<p>The Chair counted.</p>
<p>"Together with those that have been already ex- <lb/>
amined, there are nineteen."</p>
<p>A storm of derisive applause broke out.</p>
<p>"Perhaps they all contain the secret. I move <lb/>
that you open them all and read every signature that <lb/>
is attached to a note of that sort&#x2014;and read also the <lb/>
first eight words of the note."</p>
<p>"Second the motion!"</p>
<p>It was put and carried&#x2014;uproariously. Then <lb/>
poor old Richards got up, and his wife rose and <lb/>
stood at his side. Her head was bent down, so that <lb/>
none might see that she was crying. Her husband <lb/>
gave her his arm, and so supporting her, he began <lb/>
to speak in a quavering voice:</p>
<p>"My friends, you have known us two&#x2014;Mary <lb/>
and me&#x2014;all our lives, and I think you have liked <lb/>
us and respected us&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The Chair interrupted him:</p>
<p>"Allow me. It is quite true&#x2014;that which you <lb/>
are saying, Mr. Richards: this town <i>does</i> know you <lb/>
two; it <i>does</i> like you; it <i>does</i> respect you; more&#x2014; <lb/>
it honors you and <i>loves</i> you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Halliday's voice rang out:</p>
<p>"That's the hall-marked truth, too! If the Chair <lb/>
is right, let the house speak up and say it. Rise! <lb/>
Now, then&#x2014;hip! hip! hip!&#x2014;all together!"</p>
<p>The house rose in mass, faced toward the old <lb/>
<pb n="122"/>
couple eagerly, filled the air with a snowstorm of <lb/>
waving handkerchiefs, and delivered the cheers with <lb/>
all its affectionate heart.</p>
<p>The Chair then continued:</p>
<p>"What I was going to say is this: We know <lb/>
your good heart, Mr. Richards, but this is not a <lb/>
time for the exercise of charity toward offenders. <lb/>
[<i>Shouts of "Right! right!"</i>] I see your generous <lb/>
purpose in your face, but I cannot allow you to <lb/>
plead for these men&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But I was going to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Please take your seat, Mr. Richards. We must <lb/>
examine the rest of these notes&#x2014;simple fairness to <lb/>
the men who have already been exposed requires <lb/>
this. As soon as that has been done&#x2014;I give you <lb/>
my word for this&#x2014;you shall be heard."</p>
<sp><speaker><i>Many Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"Right!&#x2014;the Chair is right&#x2014;no <lb/>
interruption can be permitted at this stage! Go on! <lb/>
&#x2014;the names! the names!&#x2014;according to the terms <lb/>
of the motion!"</p>
<p>The old couple sat reluctantly down, and the hus- <lb/>
band whispered to the wife, "It is pitifully hard to <lb/>
have to wait; the shame will be greater than ever <lb/>
when they find we were only going to plead for <lb/>
<i>ourselves</i>."</p>
<p>Straightway the jollity broke loose again with the <lb/>
reading of the names.</p>
<p>"'You are far from being a bad man&#x2014;' Sig- <lb/>
nature, 'Robert J. Titmarsh.'</p>
<p>"'You are far from being a bad man&#x2014;' Sig- <lb/>
nature, 'Eliphalet Weeks.'</p>
<pb n="123"/>
<p>"'You are far from being a bad man&#x2014;' Sig- <lb/>
nature, 'Oscar B. Wilder.'"</p>
<p>At this point the house lit upon the idea of taking <lb/>
the eight words out of the Chairman's hands. He <lb/>
was not unthankful for that. Thenceforward he <lb/>
held up each note in its turn, and waited. The <lb/>
house droned out the eight words in a massed and <lb/>
measured and musical deep volume of sound (with a <lb/>
daringly close resemblance to a well-known church <lb/>
chant)&#x2014;"'You are f-a-r from being a b-a-a-a-d <lb/>
man.'" Then the Chair said, "Signature, 'Archi- <lb/>
bald Wilcox.'" And so on, and so on, name after <lb/>
name, and everybody had an increasingly and glori- <lb/>
ously good time except the wretched Nineteen. <lb/>
Now and then, when a particularly shining name <lb/>
was called, the house made the Chair wait while it <lb/>
chanted the whole of the test-remark from the be- <lb/>
ginning to the closing words, "And go to hell or <lb/>
Hadleyburg&#x2014;try and make it the for-or-m-e-r!" <lb/>
and in these special cases they added a grand and <lb/>
agonized and imposing "A-a-a-a-<i>men!</i>"</p>
<p>The list dwindled, dwindled, dwindled, poor old <lb/>
Richards keeping tally of the count, wincing when a <lb/>
name resembling his own was pronounced, and wait- <lb/>
ing in miserable suspense for the time to come when <lb/>
it would be his humiliating privilege to rise with <lb/>
Mary and finish his plea, which he was intending to <lb/>
word thus: "&#x2026; for until now we have never <lb/>
done any wrong thing, but have gone our humble <lb/>
way unreproached. We are very poor, we are old, <lb/>
<pb n="124"/>
and have no chick nor child to help us; we were <lb/>
sorely tempted, and we fell. It was my purpose <lb/>
when I got up before to make confession and beg <lb/>
that my name might not be read out in this public <lb/>
place, for it seemed to us that we could not bear it; <lb/>
but I was prevented. It was just; it was our place <lb/>
to suffer with the rest. It has been hard for us. It <lb/>
is the first time we have ever heard our name fall <lb/>
from any one's lips&#x2014;sullied. Be merciful&#x2014;for <lb/>
the sake of the better days; make our shame as <lb/>
light to bear as in your charity you can." At this <lb/>
point in his revery Mary nudged him, perceiving <lb/>
that his mind was absent. The house was chant- <lb/>
ing, "You are f-a-r," etc.</p>
<p>"Be ready," Mary whispered. "Your name <lb/>
comes now; he has read eighteen."</p>
<p>The chant ended.</p>
<p>"Next! next! next!" came volleying from all <lb/>
over the house.</p>
<p>Burgess put his hand into his pocket. The old <lb/>
couple, trembling, began to rise. Burgess fumbled <lb/>
a moment, then said,</p>
<p>"I find I have read them all."</p>
<p>Faint with joy and surprise, the couple sank into <lb/>
their seats, and Mary whispered,</p>
<p>"Oh, bless God, we are saved!&#x2014;he has lost ours <lb/>
&#x2014;I wouldn't give this for a hundred of those <lb/>
sacks!"</p>
<p>The house burst out with its "Mikado" travesty, <lb/>
and sang it three times with ever-increasing enthu- <lb/>
<pb n="125"/>
siasm, rising to its feet when it reached for the third <lb/>
time the closing line&#x2014; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"But the Symbols are here, you bet!"</l>
</lg></q>
and finishing up with cheers and a tiger for "Had- <lb/>
leyburg purity and our eighteen immortal representa- <lb/>
tives of it."</p>
<p>Then Wingate, the saddler, got up and proposed <lb/>
cheers "for the cleanest man in town, the one soli- <lb/>
tary important citizen in it who didn't try to steal <lb/>
that money&#x2014;Edward Richards."</p>
<p>They were given with great and moving hearti- <lb/>
ness; then somebody proposed that Richards be <lb/>
elected sole guardian and Symbol of the now Sacred <lb/>
Hadleyburg Tradition, with power and right to stand <lb/>
up and look the whole sarcastic world in the face.</p>
<p>Passed, by acclamation; then they sang the <lb/>
"Mikado" again, and ended it with, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And there's <i>one</i> Symbol left, you bet!"</l>

There was a pause; then&#x2014;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A Voice</i>.</speaker><p>"Now, then, who's to get the sack?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Tanner</i> (<i>with bitter sarcasm</i>).</speaker><p>"That's easy. <lb/>
The money has to be divided among the eighteen <lb/>

twenty dollars apiece&#x2014;and that remark&#x2014;each in <lb/>
his turn&#x2014;it took twenty-two minutes for the pro- <lb/>
cession to move past. Staked the stranger&#x2014;total <lb/>

<sp><speaker><i>Many Voices</i> [<i>derisively</i>.]</speaker><p>"That's it! Divvy! <lb/>

waiting!"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>The Chair</i>.</speaker><p>"Order! I now offer the stranger's <lb/>
remaining document. It says: 'If no claimant <lb/>
shall appear [<i>grand chorus of groans</i>], I desire that <lb/>
you open the sack and count out the money to the <lb/>
principal citizens of your town, they to take it in <lb/>
trust [<i>cries of "Oh! Oh! Oh!"</i>], and use it in such <lb/>
ways as to them shall seem best for the propagation <lb/>
and preservation of your community's noble reputa- <lb/>
tion for incorruptible honesty [<i>more cries</i>]&#x2014;a repu- <lb/>
tation to which their names and their efforts will add <lb/>
a new and far-reaching lustre.' [<i>Enthusiastic out- <lb/>
burst of sarcastic applause</i>.] That seems to be all. <lb/>
No&#x2014;here is a postscript:</p>
<p>"'P. S.&#x2014;<smcap>Citizens of Hadleyburg</smcap>: There <i>is</i> <lb/>
no test-remark&#x2014;nobody made one. [<i>Great sen- <lb/>
sation</i>.] There wasn't any pauper stranger, nor any <lb/>
twenty-dollar contribution, nor any accompanying <lb/>
benediction and compliment&#x2014;these are all inven- <lb/>
tions. [<i>General buzz and hum of astonishment and <lb/>
delight</i>.] Allow me to tell my story&#x2014;it will take <lb/>
but a word or two. I passed through your town at <lb/>
a certain time, and received a deep offense which I <lb/>
had not earned. Any other man would have been <lb/>
content to kill one or two of you and call it square, <lb/>
but to me that would have been a trivial revenge, <lb/>
and inadequate; for the dead do not <i>suffer</i>. Be- <lb/>
sides, I could not kill you all&#x2014;and, anyway, made <lb/>
<pb n="127"/>
as I am, even that would not have satisfied me. I <lb/>
wanted to damage every man in the place, and every <lb/>
woman&#x2014;and not in their bodies or in their estate, <lb/>
but in their vanity&#x2014;the place where feeble and <lb/>
foolish people are most vulnerable. So I disguised <lb/>
myself and came back and studied you. You were <lb/>
easy game. You had an old and lofty reputation <lb/>
for honesty, and naturally you were proud of it&#x2014; <lb/>
it was your treasure of treasures, the very apple of <lb/>
your eye. As soon as I found out that you care- <lb/>
fully and vigilantly kept yourselves and your children <lb/>
<i>out of temptation</i>, I knew how to proceed. Why, <lb/>
you simple creatures, the weakest of all weak things <lb/>
is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire. I <lb/>
laid a plan, and gathered a list of names. My pro- <lb/>
ject was to corrupt Hadleyburg the Incorruptible. <lb/>
My idea was to make liars and thieves of nearly <lb/>
half a hundred smirchless men and women who had <lb/>
never in their lives uttered a lie or stolen a penny. <lb/>
I was afraid of Goodson. He was neither born nor <lb/>
reared in Hadleyburg. I was afraid that if I started <lb/>
to operate my scheme by getting my letter laid be- <lb/>
fore you, you would say to yourselves, "Goodson <lb/>
is the only man among us who would give away <lb/>
twenty dollars to a poor devil"&#x2014;and then you <lb/>
might not bite at my bait. But Heaven took Good- <lb/>
son; then I knew I was safe, and I set my trap and <lb/>
baited it. It may be that I shall not catch all the <lb/>
men to whom I mailed the pretended test secret, but <lb/>
I shall catch the most of them, if I know Hadley- <lb/>
<pb n="128"/>
burg nature. [<i>Voices</i>. "Right&#x2014;he got every last <lb/>
one of them."] I believe they will even steal osten- <lb/>
sible <i>gamble</i>-money, rather than miss, poor, tempted, <lb/>
and mistrained fellows. I am hoping to eternally <lb/>
and everlastingly squelch your vanity and give Had- <lb/>
leyburg a new renown&#x2014;one that will <i>stick</i>&#x2014;and <lb/>
spread far. If I have succeeded, open the sack and <lb/>
summon the Committee on Propagation and Preser- <lb/>
vation of the Hadleyburg Reputation.'"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker><i>A Cyclone of Voices</i>.</speaker><p>"Open it! Open it! The <lb/>

<p>The Chair ripped the sack wide, and gathered up <lb/>
a handful of bright, broad, yellow coins, shook them <lb/>
together, then examined them&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Friends, they are only gilded disks of lead!"</p>
<p>There was a crashing outbreak of delight over this <lb/>
news, and when the noise had subsided, the tanner <lb/>
called out:</p>
<p>"By right of apparent seniority in this business, <lb/>

<sp><speaker><i>The Saddler</i>.</speaker><p>"Mr. Chairman, we've got <i>one</i> <lb/>
clean man left, anyway, out of the late aristocracy; <lb/>
and he needs money, and deserves it. I move that <lb/>

auction off that sack of gilt twenty-dollar pieces, and <lb/>
give the result to the right man&#x2014;the man whom <lb/>
Hadleyburg delights to honor&#x2014;Edward Richards."</p>
<p>This was received with great enthusiasm, the dog <lb/>
taking a hand again; the saddler started the bids at <lb/>
a dollar, the Brixton folk and Barnum's representa- <lb/>
tive fought hard for it, the people cheered every <lb/>
jump that the bids made, the excitement climbed <lb/>
moment by moment higher and higher, the bidders <lb/>

then fifty, then to a hundred, then&#x2014;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the auction Richards whis- <lb/>
pered in distress to his wife: "O Mary, can we <lb/>

ning to sob), "we are <i>so</i> poor!&#x2014;but&#x2014;but&#x2014;do as <lb/>
you think best&#x2014;do as you think best."</p>
<p>Edward fell&#x2014;that is, he sat still; sat with a con- <lb/>
science which was not satisfied, but which was over- <lb/>
powered by circumstances.</p>
<p>Meantime a stranger, who looked like an amateur <lb/>
detective gotten up as an impossible English earl, <lb/>
had been watching the evening's proceedings with <lb/>
manifest interest, and with a contented expression <lb/>
in his face; and he had been privately commenting <lb/>
to himself. He was now soliloquizing somewhat <lb/>
like this: "None of the Eighteen are bidding; <lb/>
<pb n="131"/>
that is not satisfactory; I must change that&#x2014;the <lb/>
dramatic unities require it; they must buy the sack <lb/>
they tried to steal; they must pay a heavy price, <lb/>
too&#x2014;some of them are rich. And another thing, <lb/>
when I make a mistake in Hadleyburg nature the <lb/>
man that puts that error upon me is entitled to a <lb/>
high honorarium, and some one must pay it. This <lb/>
poor old Richards has brought my judgment to <lb/>
shame; he is an honest man:&#x2014;I don't understand <lb/>
it, but I acknowledge it. Yes, he saw my deuces <lb/>
<i>and</i> with a straight flush, and by rights the pot is his. <lb/>
And it shall be a jack-pot, too, if I can manage it. <lb/>
He disappointed me, but let that pass."</p>
<p>He was watching the bidding. At a thousand, <lb/>
the market broke; the prices tumbled swiftly. He <lb/>
waited&#x2014;and still watched. One competitor dropped <lb/>
out; then another, and another. He put in a bid <lb/>
or two, now. When the bids had sunk to ten dol- <lb/>
lars, he added a five; some one raised him a three; <lb/>
he waited a moment, then flung in a fifty-dollar <lb/>
jump, and the sack was his&#x2014;at &#x0024;1,282. The <lb/>
house broke out in cheers&#x2014;then stopped; for he <lb/>
was on his feet, and had lifted his hand. He began <lb/>
to speak.</p>
<p>"I desire to say a word, and ask a favor. I am a <lb/>
speculator in rarities, and I have dealings with per- <lb/>
sons interested in numismatics all over the world. I <lb/>
can make a profit on this purchase, just as it stands; <lb/>
but there is a way, if I can get your approval, <lb/>
whereby I can make every one of these leaden <lb/>
<pb n="132"/>
twenty-dollar pieces worth its face in gold, and per- <lb/>
haps more. Grant me that approval, and I will give <lb/>
part of my gains to your Mr. Richards, whose in- <lb/>
vulnerable probity you have so justly and so cordially <lb/>
recognized to-night; his share shall be ten thousand <lb/>
dollars, and I will hand him the money to-morrow. <lb/>
[<i>Great applause from the house</i>. But the "invulner- <lb/>
able probity" made the Richardses blush prettily; <lb/>
however, it went for modesty, and did no harm.] <lb/>
If you will pass my proposition by a good majority <lb/>
&#x2014;I would like a two-thirds vote&#x2014;I will regard that <lb/>
as the town's consent, and that is all I ask. Rarities <lb/>
are always helped by any device which will rouse <lb/>
curiosity and compel remark. Now if I may have <lb/>
your permission to stamp upon the faces of each of <lb/>
these ostensible coins the names of the eighteen gen- <lb/>
tlemen who&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Nine-tenths of the audience were on their feet in <lb/>
a moment&#x2014;dog and all&#x2014;and the proposition was <lb/>
carried with a whirlwind of approving applause and <lb/>
laughter.</p>
<p>They sat down, and all the Symbols except "Dr." <lb/>
Clay Harkness got up, violently protesting against <lb/>
the proposed outrage, and threatening to&#x2014;</p>
<p>"I beg you not to threaten me," said the stranger, <lb/>
calmly. "I know my legal rights, and am not ac- <lb/>
customed to being frightened at bluster." [<i>Applause</i>.] <lb/>
He sat down. "Dr." Harkness saw an opportunity <lb/>
here. He was one of the two very rich men of the <lb/>
place, and Pinkerton was the other. Harkness was <lb/>
<pb n="133"/>
proprietor of a mint; that is to say, a popular patent <lb/>
medicine. He was running for the Legislature on <lb/>
one ticket, and Pinkerton on the other. It was a <lb/>
close race and a hot one, and getting hotter every <lb/>
day. Both had strong appetites for money; each <lb/>
had bought a great tract of land, with a purpose; <lb/>
there was going to be a new railway, and each <lb/>
wanted to be in the Legislature and help locate the <lb/>
route to his own advantage; a single vote might <lb/>
make the decision, and with it two or three fortunes. <lb/>
The stake was large, and Harkness was a daring <lb/>
speculator. He was sitting close to the stranger. <lb/>
He leaned over while one or another of the other <lb/>
Symbols was entertaining the house with protests <lb/>
and appeals, and asked, in a whisper,</p>
<p>"What is your price for the sack?"</p>
<p>"Forty thousand dollars."</p>
<p>"I'll give you twenty."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Twenty-five."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Say thirty."</p>
<p>"The price is forty thousand dollars; not a penny <lb/>
less."</p>
<p>"All right, I'll give it. I will come to the hotel <lb/>
at ten in the morning. I don't want it known; will <lb/>
see you privately."</p>
<p>"Very good." Then the stranger got up and <lb/>
said to the house:</p>
<p>"I find it late. The speeches of these gentlemen <lb/>
<pb n="134"/>
are not without merit, not without interest, not with- <lb/>
out grace; yet if I may be excused I will take my <lb/>
leave. I thank you for the great favor which you <lb/>
have shown me in granting my petition. I ask the <lb/>
Chair to keep the sack for me until to-morrow, and <lb/>
to hand these three five-hundred-dollar notes to Mr. <lb/>
Richards." They were passed up to the Chair. <lb/>
"At nine I will call for the sack, and at eleven will <lb/>
deliver the rest of the ten thousand to Mr. Richards <lb/>
in person, at his home. Good night."</p>
<p>Then he slipped out, and left the audience making <lb/>
a vast noise, which was composed of a mixture of <lb/>
cheers, the "Mikado" song, dog-disapproval, and <lb/>
the chant, "You are f-a-r from being a b-a-a-d man <lb/>
&#x2014;a-a-a a-men!"</p></sp>

<p>At home the Richardses had to endure congratu- <lb/>
lations and compliments until midnight. Then they <lb/>
were left to themselves. They looked a little sad, <lb/>
and they sat silent and thinking. Finally Mary <lb/>
sighed and said,</p>
<p>"Do you think we are to blame, Edward&#x2014;<i>much</i> <lb/>
to blame?" and her eyes wandered to the accusing <lb/>
triplet of big bank notes lying on the table, where <lb/>
the congratulators had been gloating over them and <lb/>
reverently fingering them. Edward did not answer <lb/>
at once; then he brought out a sigh and said, <lb/>
hesitatingly:</p>
<p>"We&#x2014;we couldn't help it, Mary. It&#x2014;well, it <lb/>
was ordered. <i>All</i> things are."</p>
<pb n="135"/>
<p>Mary glanced up and looked at him steadily, but <lb/>
he didn't return the look. Presently she said:</p>
<p>"I thought congratulations and praises always <lb/>
tasted good. But&#x2014;it seems to me, now&#x2014; <lb/>
Edward?"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Are you going to stay in the bank?"</p>
<p>"N-no."</p>
<p>"Resign?"</p>
<p>"In the morning&#x2014;by note."</p>
<p>"It does seem best."</p>
<p>Richards bowed his head in his hands and <lb/>
muttered:</p>
<p>"Before, I was not afraid to let oceans of peo- <lb/>
ple's money pour through my hands, but&#x2014;Mary, <lb/>
I am so tired, so tired&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"We will go to bed."</p>
<p>At nine in the morning the stranger called for the <lb/>
sack and took it to the hotel in a cab. At ten Hark- <lb/>
ness had a talk with him privately. The stranger <lb/>
asked for and got five checks on a metropolitan bank <lb/>
&#x2014;drawn to "Bearer,"&#x2014;four for &#x0024;1,500 each, and <lb/>
one for &#x0024;34,000. He put one of the former in his <lb/>
pocketbook, and the remainder, representing &#x0024;38,- <lb/>
500, he put in an envelope, and with these he added <lb/>
a note, which he wrote after Harkness was gone. <lb/>
At eleven he called at the Richards house and <lb/>
knocked. Mrs. Richards peeped through the shut- <lb/>
ters, then went and received the envelope, and the <lb/>
stranger disappeared without a word. She came <lb/>
<pb n="136"/>
back flushed and a little unsteady on her legs, and <lb/>
gasped out:</p>
<p>"I am sure I recognized him! Last night it <lb/>
seemed to me that maybe I had seen him some- <lb/>
where before."</p>
<p>"He is the man that brought the sack here?"</p>
<p>"I am almost sure of it."</p>
<p>"Then he is the ostensible Stephenson, too, and <lb/>
sold every important citizen in this town with his <lb/>
bogus secret. Now if he has sent checks instead of <lb/>
money, we are sold, too, after we thought we had <lb/>
escaped. I was beginning to feel fairly comfortable <lb/>
once more, after my night's rest, but the look of <lb/>
that envelope makes me sick. It isn't fat enough; <lb/>
&#x0024;8,500 in even the largest bank notes makes more <lb/>
bulk than that."</p>
<p>"Edward, why do you object to checks?"</p>
<p>"Checks signed by Stephenson! I am resigned <lb/>
to take the &#x0024;8,500 if it could come in bank <lb/>
notes&#x2014;for it does seem that it was so ordered, <lb/>
Mary&#x2014;but I have never had much courage, and I <lb/>
have not the pluck to try to market a check signed <lb/>
with that disastrous name. It would be a trap. <lb/>
That man tried to catch me; we escaped somehow <lb/>
or other; and now he is trying a new way. If it is <lb/>
checks&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, Edward, it is <i>too</i> bad!" and she held up <lb/>
the checks and began to cry.</p>
<p>"Put them in the fire! quick! we mustn't be <lb/>
tempted. It is a trick to make the world laugh at <lb/>
<pb n="137"/>
<i>us</i>, along with the rest, and&#x2014; Give them to <i>me</i>, <lb/>
since you can't do it!" He snatched them and <lb/>
tried to hold his grip till he could get to the stove; <lb/>
but he was human, he was a cashier, and he stopped <lb/>
a moment to make sure of the signature. Then he <lb/>
came near to fainting.</p>
<p>"Fan me, Mary, fan me! They are the same as <lb/>
gold!"</p>
<p>"Oh, how lovely, Edward! Why?"</p>
<p>"Signed by Harkness. What can the mystery of <lb/>
that be, Mary?"</p>
<p>"Edward, do you think&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Look here&#x2014;look at this! Fifteen&#x2014;fifteen&#x2014; <lb/>
fifteen&#x2014;thirty-four. Thirty-eight thousand five <lb/>
hundred! Mary, the sack isn't worth twelve dol- <lb/>
lars, and Harkness&#x2014;apparently&#x2014;has paid about <lb/>
par for it."</p>
<p>"And does it all come to us, do you think&#x2014;in- <lb/>
stead of the ten thousand?"</p>
<p>"Why, it looks like it. And the checks are made <lb/>
to 'Bearer,' too."</p>
<p>"Is that good, Edward? What is it for?"</p>
<p>"A hint to collect them at some distant bank, I <lb/>
reckon. Perhaps Harkness doesn't want the matter <lb/>
known. What is that&#x2014;a note?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It was with the checks."</p>
<p>It was in the "Stephenson" handwriting, but <lb/>
there was no signature. It said: <lb/>
<q>"<i>I am a disappointed man. Your honesty is beyond the reach of <lb/>
temptation. I had a different idea about it, but I wronged you in that,</i> <lb/>
<pb n="138"/>
<i>and I beg pardon, and do it sincerely. I honor you&#x2014;and that is <lb/>
sincere too. This town is not worthy to kiss the hem of your garment. <lb/>
Dear sir, I made a square bet with myself that there were nineteen <lb/>
debauchable men in your self-righteous community. I have lost. Take <lb/>
the whole pot, you are entitled to it</i>."</q></p>
<p>Richards drew a deep sigh, and said:</p>
<p>"It seems written with fire&#x2014;it burns so. Mary <lb/>
&#x2014;I am miserable again."</p>
<p>"I, too. Ah, dear, I wish&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"To think, Mary&#x2014;he <i>believes</i> in me."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't, Edward&#x2014;I can't bear it."</p>
<p>"If those beautiful words were deserved, Mary <lb/>

them. And I would put that paper away, as repre- <lb/>
senting more than gold and jewels, and keep it <lb/>
always. But now&#x2014; We could not live in the <lb/>
shadow of its accusing presence, Mary."</p>
<p>He put it in the fire.</p>
<p>A messenger arrived and delivered an envelope.</p>

from Burgess.</p>

<p>"Saved, once more. And on such terms!" He <lb/>
<pb n="139"/>
put the note in the fire. "I&#x2014;I wish I were dead, <lb/>
Mary, I wish I were out of it all."</p>
<p>"Oh, these are bitter, bitter days, Edward. The <lb/>
stabs, through their very generosity, are so deep&#x2014; <lb/>
and they come so fast!"</p>
<p>Three days before the election each of two thou- <lb/>
sand voters suddenly found himself in possession of <lb/>
a prized memento&#x2014;one of the renowned bogus <lb/>
double-eagles. Around one of its faces was stamped <lb/>
these words: "<smcap>the remark i made to the poor <lb/>
stranger was</smcap>&#x2014;" Around the other face was <lb/>
stamped these: "<smcap>go, and reform</smcap>. [<smcap>signed</smcap>] <lb/>
<smcap>pinkerton</smcap>." Thus the entire remaining refuse of <lb/>
the renowned joke was emptied upon a single head, <lb/>
and with calamitous effect. It revived the recent <lb/>
vast laugh and concentrated it upon Pinkerton; and <lb/>
Harkness's election was a walkover.</p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours after the Richardses had <lb/>
received their checks their consciences were quieting <lb/>
down, discouraged; the old couple were learning to <lb/>
reconcile themselves to the sin which they had com- <lb/>
mitted. But they were to learn, now, that a sin <lb/>
takes on new and real terrors when there seems a <lb/>
chance that it is going to be found out. This gives <lb/>
it a fresh and most substantial and important aspect. <lb/>
At church the morning sermon was of the usual <lb/>
pattern; it was the same old things said in the same <lb/>
old way; they had heard them a thousand times and <lb/>
found them innocuous, next to meaningless, and <lb/>
easy to sleep under; but now it was different: the <lb/>
<pb n="140"/>
sermon seemed to bristle with accusations; it seemed <lb/>
aimed straight and specially at people who were con- <lb/>
cealing deadly sins. After church they got away <lb/>
from the mob of congratulators as soon as they <lb/>
could, and hurried homeward, chilled to the bone at <lb/>
they did not know what&#x2014;vague, shadowy, indefi- <lb/>
nite fears. And by chance they caught a glimpse of <lb/>
Mr. Burgess as he turned a corner. He paid no <lb/>
attention to their nod of recognition! He hadn't <lb/>
seen it; but they did not know that. What could <lb/>
his conduct mean? It might mean&#x2014;it might mean <lb/>
&#x2014;oh, a dozen dreadful things. Was it possible that <lb/>
he knew that Richards could have cleared him of <lb/>
guilt in that bygone time, and had been silently <lb/>
waiting for a chance to even up accounts? At <lb/>
home, in their distress they got to imagining that <lb/>
their servant might have been in the next room <lb/>
listening when Richards revealed the secret to his <lb/>
wife that he knew of Burgess's innocence; next, <lb/>
Richards began to imagine that he had heard the <lb/>
swish of a gown in there at that time; next, he was <lb/>
sure he <i>had</i> heard it. They would call Sarah in, on <lb/>
a pretext, and watch her face: if she had been be- <lb/>
traying them to Mr. Burgess, it would show in her <lb/>
manner. They asked her some questions&#x2014;ques- <lb/>
tions which were so random and incoherent and <lb/>
seemingly purposeless that the girl felt sure that the <lb/>
old people's minds had been affected by their sudden <lb/>
good fortune; the sharp and watchful gaze which <lb/>
they bent upon her frightened her, and that com- <lb/>
<pb n="141"/>
pleted the business. She blushed, she became <lb/>
nervous and confused, and to the old people these <lb/>
were plain signs of guilt&#x2014;guilt of some fearful sort <lb/>
or other&#x2014;without doubt she was a spy and a traitor. <lb/>
When they were alone again they began to piece <lb/>
many unrelated things together and get horrible re- <lb/>
sults out of the combination. When things had got <lb/>
about to the worst, Richards was delivered of a sud- <lb/>
den gasp, and his wife asked,</p>
<p>"Oh, what is it?&#x2014;what is it?"</p>
<p>"The note&#x2014;Burgess's note! Its language was <lb/>
sarcastic, I see it now." He quoted: "'At bot- <lb/>
tom you cannot respect me, <i>knowing</i>, as you do, of <lb/>
<i>that matter</i> of which I am accused'&#x2014;oh, it is per- <lb/>
fectly plain, now, God help me! He knows that I <lb/>
know! You see the ingenuity of the phrasing. It <lb/>
was a trap&#x2014;and like a fool, I walked into it. And <lb/>
Mary&#x2014;?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is dreadful&#x2014;I know what you are going <lb/>
to say&#x2014;he didn't return your transcript of the pre- <lb/>
tended test-remark."</p>
<p>"No&#x2014;kept it to destroy us with. Mary, he has <lb/>
exposed us to some already. I know it&#x2014;I know it <lb/>
well. I saw it in a dozen faces after church. Ah, <lb/>
he wouldn't answer our nod of recognition&#x2014;<i>he</i> <lb/>
knew what he had been doing!"</p>
<p>In the night the doctor was called. The news <lb/>
went around in the morning that the old couple were <lb/>
rather seriously ill&#x2014;prostrated by the exhausting <lb/>
excitement growing out of their great windfall, the <lb/>
<pb n="142"/>
congratulations, and the late hours, the doctor said. <lb/>
The town was sincerely distressed; for these old <lb/>
people were about all it had left to be proud of, <lb/>
now.</p>
<p>Two days later the news was worse. The old <lb/>
couple were delirious, and were doing strange things. <lb/>
By witness of the nurses, Richards had exhibited <lb/>
checks&#x2014;for &#x0024;8,500? No&#x2014;for an amazing sum <lb/>
&#x2014;&#x0024;38,500! What could be the explanation of this <lb/>
gigantic piece of luck?</p>
<p>The following day the nurses had more news&#x2014; <lb/>
and wonderful. They had concluded to hide the <lb/>
checks, lest harm come to them; but when they <lb/>
searched they were gone from under the patient's <lb/>
pillow&#x2014;vanished away. The patient said:</p>
<p>"Let the pillow alone; what do you want?"</p>
<p>"We thought it best that the checks&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"You will never see them again&#x2014;they are de- <lb/>
stroyed. They came from Satan. I saw the hell- <lb/>
brand on them, and I knew they were sent to betray <lb/>
me to sin." Then he fell to gabbling strange and <lb/>
dreadful things which were not clearly understand- <lb/>
able, and which the doctor admonished them to keep <lb/>
to themselves.</p>
<p>Richards was right; the checks were never seen <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>A nurse must have talked in her sleep, for within <lb/>
two days the forbidden gabblings were the property <lb/>
of the town; and they were of a surprising sort. <lb/>
They seemed to indicate that Richards had been a <lb/>
<pb n="143"/>
claimant for the sack himself, and that Burgess had <lb/>
concealed that fact and then maliciously betrayed it.</p>
<p>Burgess was taxed with this and stoutly denied it. <lb/>
And he said it was not fair to attach weight to the <lb/>
chatter of a sick old man who was out of his mind. <lb/>
Still, suspicion was in the air, and there was much <lb/>
talk.</p>
<p>After a day or two it was reported that Mrs. <lb/>
Richards's delirious deliveries were getting to be <lb/>
duplicates of her husband's. Suspicion flamed up <lb/>
into conviction, now, and the town's pride in the <lb/>
purity of its one undiscredited important citizen be- <lb/>
gan to dim down and flicker toward extinction.</p>
<p>Six days passed, then came more news. The old <lb/>
couple were dying. Richards's mind cleared in his <lb/>
latest hour, and he sent for Burgess. Burgess said:</p>
<p>"Let the room be cleared. I think he wishes to <lb/>
say something in privacy."</p>
<p>"No!" said Richards: "I want witnesses. I <lb/>
want you all to hear my confession, so that I may <lb/>
die a man, and not a dog. I was clean&#x2014;artificially <lb/>
&#x2014;like the rest; and like the rest I fell when tempta- <lb/>
tion came. I signed a lie, and claimed the miserable <lb/>
sack. Mr. Burgess remembered that I had done <lb/>
him a service, and in gratitude (and ignorance) he <lb/>
suppressed my claim and saved me. You know the <lb/>
thing that was charged against Burgess years ago. <lb/>
My testimony, and mine alone, could have cleared <lb/>
him, and I was a coward, and left him to suffer <lb/>
disgrace&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="144"/>
<p>"No&#x2014;no&#x2014;Mr. Richards, you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"My servant betrayed my secret to him&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No one has betrayed anything to me&#x2014;" <lb/>
&#x2014;"and then he did a natural and justifiable thing, <lb/>
he repented of the saving kindness which he had <lb/>
done me, and he <i>exposed</i> me&#x2014;as I deserved&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Never!&#x2014;I make oath&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Out of my heart I forgive him."</p>
<p>Burgess's impassioned protestations fell upon deaf <lb/>
ears; the dying man passed away without knowing <lb/>
that once more he had done poor Burgess a wrong. <lb/>
The old wife died that night.</p>
<p>The last of the sacred Nineteen had fallen a prey <lb/>
to the fiendish sack; the town was stripped of the <lb/>
last rag of its ancient glory. Its mourning was not <lb/>
showy, but it was deep.</p>
<p>By act of the Legislature&#x2014;upon prayer and peti- <lb/>
tion&#x2014;Hadleyburg was allowed to change its name <lb/>
to (never mind what&#x2014;I will not give it away), and <lb/>
leave one word out of the motto that for many gen- <lb/>
erations had graced the town's official seal.</p>
<p>It is an honest town once more, and the man will <lb/>
have to rise early that catches it napping again.</p>

<head><b>MY FIRST LIE, AND HOW I GOT OUT <lb/>
OF IT</b></head>
<p><smcap>As</smcap> I understand it, what you desire is information <lb/>
about "my first lie, and how I got out of it." <lb/>
I was born in 1835; I am well along, and my <lb/>
memory is not as good as it was. If you had asked <lb/>
about my first truth it would have been easier for <lb/>
me and kinder of you, for I remember that fairly <lb/>
well; I remember it as if it were last week. The <lb/>
family think it was week before, but that is flattery <lb/>
and probably has a selfish project back of it. When <lb/>
a person has become seasoned by experience and <lb/>
has reached the age of sixty-four, which is the age <lb/>
of discretion, he likes a family compliment as well <lb/>
as ever, but he does not lose his head over it as in <lb/>
the old innocent days.</p>
<p>I do not remember my first lie, it is too far back; <lb/>
but I remember my second one very well. I was <lb/>
nine days old at the time, and had noticed that if a <lb/>
pin was sticking in me and I advertised it in the <lb/>
usual fashion, I was lovingly petted and coddled and <lb/>
pitied in a most agreeable way and got a ration be- <lb/>
tween meals besides. It was human nature to want <lb/>
<pb n="146"/>
to get these riches, and I fell. I lied about the pin <lb/>
&#x2014;advertising one when there wasn't any. You <lb/>
would have done it; George Washington did it; <lb/>
anybody would have done it. During the first half <lb/>
of my life I never knew a child that was able to rise <lb/>
above that temptation and keep from telling that lie. <lb/>
Up to 1867 all the civilized children that were ever <lb/>
born into the world were liars&#x2014;including George. <lb/>
Then the safety-pin came in and blocked the game. <lb/>
But is that reform worth anything? No; for it is <lb/>
reform by force and has no virtue in it; it merely <lb/>
stops that form of lying; it doesn't impair the dis- <lb/>
position to lie, by a shade. It is the cradle applica- <lb/>
tion of conversion by fire and sword, or of the tem- <lb/>
perance principle through prohibition.</p>
<p>To return to that early lie. They found no pin, <lb/>
and they realized that another liar had been added <lb/>
to the world's supply. For by grace of a rare in- <lb/>
spiration, a quite commonplace but seldom noticed <lb/>
fact was borne in upon their understandings&#x2014;that <lb/>
almost all lies are acts, and speech has no part in <lb/>
them. Then, if they examined a little further they <lb/>
recognized that all people are liars from the cradle <lb/>
onward, without exception, and that they begin to <lb/>
lie as soon as they wake in the morning, and keep it <lb/>
up, without rest or refreshment, until they go to <lb/>
sleep at night. If they arrived at that truth it prob- <lb/>
ably grieved them&#x2014;did, if they had been heedlessly <lb/>
and ignorantly educated by their books and teachers; <lb/>
for why should a person grieve over a thing which <lb/>
<pb n="147"/>
by the eternal law of his make he cannot help? He <lb/>
didn't invent the law; it is merely his business to <lb/>
obey it and keep still; join the universal conspiracy <lb/>
and keep so still that he shall deceive his fellow-con- <lb/>
spirators into imagining that he doesn't know that <lb/>
the law exists. It is what we all do&#x2014;we that know. <lb/>
I am speaking of the lie of silent assertion; we can <lb/>
tell it without saying a word, and we all do it&#x2014;we <lb/>
that know. In the magnitude of its territorial spread <lb/>
it is one of the most majestic lies that the civiliza- <lb/>
tions make it their sacred and anxious care to guard <lb/>
and watch and propagate.</p>
<p>For instance: It would not be possible for a <lb/>
humane and intelligent person to invent a rational <lb/>
excuse for slavery; yet you will remember that in <lb/>
the early days of the emancipation agitation in the <lb/>
North, the agitators got but small help or counte- <lb/>
nance from any one. Argue and plead and pray as <lb/>
they might, they could not break the universal still- <lb/>
ness that reigned, from pulpit and press all the way <lb/>
down to the bottom of society&#x2014;the clammy still- <lb/>
ness created and maintained by the lie of silent asser- <lb/>
tion&#x2014;the silent assertion that there wasn't anything <lb/>
going on in which humane and intelligent people <lb/>
were interested.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Dreyfus case to the end <lb/>
of it, all France, except a couple of dozen moral <lb/>
paladins, lay under the smother of the silent-asser- <lb/>
tion lie that no wrong was being done to a perse- <lb/>
cuted and unoffending man. The like smother <lb/>
<pb n="148"/>
was over England lately, a good half of the popula- <lb/>
tion silently letting on that they were not aware <lb/>
that Mr. Chamberlain was trying to manufacture a <lb/>
war in South Africa and was willing to pay fancy <lb/>
prices for the materials.</p>
<p>Now there we have instances of three prominent <lb/>
ostensible civilizations working the silent-assertion <lb/>
lie. Could one find other instances in the three <lb/>
countries? I think so. Not so very many, per- <lb/>
haps, but say a billion&#x2014;just so as to keep within <lb/>
bounds. Are those countries working that kind of <lb/>
lie, day in and day out, in thousands and thousands <lb/>
of varieties, without ever resting? Yes, we know that <lb/>
to be true. The universal conspiracy of the silent- <lb/>
assertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere, <lb/>
and always in the interest of a stupidity or a sham, <lb/>
never in the interest of a thing fine or respectable. <lb/>
Is it the most timid and shabby of all lies? It <lb/>
seems to have the look of it. For ages and ages it <lb/>
has mutely labored in the interest of despotisms and <lb/>
aristocracies and chattel slaveries, and military <lb/>
slaveries, and religious slaveries, and has kept them <lb/>
alive; keeps them alive yet, here and there and <lb/>
yonder, all about the globe; and will go on keeping <lb/>
them alive until the silent-assertion lie retires from <lb/>
business&#x2014;the silent assertion that nothing is going <lb/>
on which fair and intelligent men are aware of and <lb/>
are engaged by their duty to try to stop.</p>
<p>What I am arriving at is this: When whole races <lb/>
and peoples conspire to propagate gigantic mute lies <lb/>
<pb n="149"/>
in the interest of tyrannies and shams, why should <lb/>
we care anything about the trifling lies told by in- <lb/>
dividuals? Why should we try to make it appear <lb/>
that abstention from lying is a virtue? Why should <lb/>
we want to beguile ourselves in that way? Why <lb/>
should we without shame help the nation lie, and <lb/>
then be ashamed to do a little lying on our own <lb/>
account? Why shouldn't we be honest and honor- <lb/>
able, and lie every time we get a chance? That is <lb/>
to say, why shouldn't we be consistent, and either <lb/>
lie all the time or not at all? Why should we help <lb/>
the nation lie the whole day long and then object to <lb/>
telling one little individual private lie in our own <lb/>
interest to go to bed on? Just for the refreshment <lb/>
of it, I mean, and to take the rancid taste out of our <lb/>
mouth.</p>
<p>Here in England they have the oddest ways. <lb/>
They won't tell a spoken lie&#x2014;nothing can persuade <lb/>
them. Except in a large moral interest, like politics <lb/>
or religion, I mean. To tell a spoken lie to get <lb/>
even the poorest little personal advantage out of it is <lb/>
a thing which is impossible to them. They make <lb/>
me ashamed of myself sometimes, they are so <lb/>
bigoted. They will not even tell a lie for the fun of <lb/>
it; they will not tell it when it hasn't even a sugges- <lb/>
tion of damage or advantage in it for any one. This <lb/>
has a restraining influence upon me in spite of <lb/>
reason, and I am always getting out of practice.</p>
<p>Of course, they tell all sorts of little unspoken lies, <lb/>
just like anybody; but they don't notice it until their <lb/>
<pb n="150"/>
attention is called to it. They have got me so that <lb/>
sometimes I never tell a verbal lie now except in a <lb/>
modified form; and even in the modified form they <lb/>
don't approve of it. Still, that is as far as I can go <lb/>
in the interest of the growing friendly relations <lb/>
between the two countries; I must keep some of my <lb/>
self-respect&#x2014;and my health. I can live on a low <lb/>
diet, but I can't get along on no sustenance at all.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when these people have <lb/>
to come out with a spoken lie, for that is a thing <lb/>
which happens to everybody once in a while, and <lb/>
would happen to the angels if they came down here <lb/>
much. Particularly to the angels, in fact, for the <lb/>
lies I speak of are self-sacrificing ones told for a gen- <lb/>
erous object, not a mean one; but even when these <lb/>
people tell a lie of that sort it seems to scare them <lb/>
and unsettle their minds. It is a wonderful thing to <lb/>
see, and shows that they are all insane. In fact, it <lb/>
is a country full of the most interesting superstitions.</p>
<p>I have an English friend of twenty-five years' <lb/>
standing, and yesterday when we were coming down- <lb/>
town on top of the 'bus I happened to tell him a lie <lb/>
&#x2014;a modified one, of course; a half-breed, a <lb/>
mulatto: I can't seem to tell any other kind now, <lb/>
the market is so flat. I was explaining to him how <lb/>
I got out of an embarrassment in Austria last year. <lb/>
I do not know what might have become of me if I <lb/>
hadn't happened to remember to tell the police that <lb/>
I belonged to the same family as the Prince of <lb/>
Wales. That made everything pleasant and they let <lb/>
<pb n="151"/>
me go; and apologized, too, and were ever so kind <lb/>
and obliging and polite, and couldn't do too much <lb/>
for me, and explained how the mistake came to be <lb/>
made, and promised to hang the officer that did it, <lb/>
and hoped I would let bygones be bygones and not <lb/>
say anything about it; and I said they could depend <lb/>
on me. My friend said, austerely:</p>
<p>"You call it a modified lie? Where is the <lb/>
modification?"</p>
<p>I explained that it lay in the form of my state- <lb/>
ment to the police.</p>
<p>"I didn't say I belonged to the royal family: I <lb/>
only said I belonged to the same family as the Prince <lb/>
&#x2014;meaning the human family, of course; and if <lb/>
those people had had any penetration they would <lb/>
have known it. I can't go around furnishing brains <lb/>
to the police; it is not to be expected."</p>
<p>"How did you feel after that performance?"</p>
<p>"Well, of course I was distressed to find that the <lb/>
police had misunderstood me, but as long as I had <lb/>
not told any lie I knew there was no occasion to sit <lb/>
up nights and worry about it."</p>
<p>My friend struggled with the case several minutes, <lb/>
turning it over and examining it in his mind; then he <lb/>
said that so far as he could see the modification was <lb/>
itself a lie, being a misleading reservation of an ex- <lb/>
planatory fact; so I had told two lies instead of one.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have done it," said he: "I have <lb/>
never told a lie, and I should be very sorry to do <lb/>
such a thing."</p>
<pb n="152"/>
<p>Just then he lifted his hat and smiled a basketful <lb/>
of surprised and delighted smiles down at a gentle- <lb/>
man who was passing in a hansom.</p>
<p>"Who was that, G<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Then why did you do that?"</p>
<p>"Because I saw he thought he knew me and was <lb/>
expecting it of me. If I hadn't done it he would <lb/>
have been hurt. I didn't want to embarrass him <lb/>
before the whole street."</p>
<p>"Well, your heart was right, G<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, and your <lb/>
act was right. What you did was kindly and <lb/>
courteous and beautiful; I would have done it <lb/>
myself: but it was a lie."</p>
<p>"A lie? I didn't say a word. How do you <lb/>
make it out?"</p>
<p>"I know you didn't speak, still you said to him <lb/>
very plainly and enthusiastically in dumb show, <lb/>
'Hello! you in town? Awful glad to see you, old <lb/>
fellow; when did you get back?' Concealed in <lb/>
your actions was what you have called 'a misleading <lb/>
reservation of an explanatory fact'&#x2014;the fact that <lb/>
you had never seen him before. You expressed joy <lb/>
in encountering him&#x2014;a lie; and you made that <lb/>
reservation&#x2014;another lie. It was my pair over <lb/>
again. But don't be troubled&#x2014;we all do it."</p>
<p>Two hours later, at dinner, when quite other mat- <lb/>
ters were being discussed, he told how he happened <lb/>
along once just in the nick of time to do a great serv- <lb/>
ice for a family who were old friends of his. The <lb/>
<pb n="153"/>
head of it had suddenly died in circumstances and <lb/>
surroundings of a ruinously disgraceful character. <lb/>
If known, the facts would break the hearts of the <lb/>
innocent family and put upon them a load of unen- <lb/>
durable shame. There was no help but in a giant <lb/>
lie, and he girded up his loins and told it.</p>
<p>"The family never found out, G<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>?"</p>
<p>"Never. In all these years they have never sus- <lb/>
pected. They were proud of him, and always had <lb/>
reason to be; they are proud of him yet, and to them <lb/>
his memory is sacred and stainless and beautiful."</p>
<p>"They had a narrow escape, G<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>."</p>
<p>"Indeed they had."</p>
<p>"For the very next man that came along might <lb/>
have been one of these heartless and shameless truth- <lb/>
mongers. You have told the truth a million times <lb/>
in your life, G<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/>, but that one golden lie atones <lb/>
for it all. Persevere."</p>
<p>Some may think me not strict enough in my <lb/>
morals, but that position is hardly tenable. There <lb/>
are many kinds of lying which I do not approve. <lb/>
I do not like an injurious lie, except when it injures <lb/>
somebody else; and I do not like the lie of bravado, <lb/>
nor the lie of virtuous ecstasy: the latter was affected <lb/>
by Bryant, the former by Carlyle.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant said, "Truth crushed to earth will <lb/>
rise again."</p>
<p>I have taken medals at thirteen world's fairs, and <lb/>
may claim to be not without capacity, but I never <lb/>
told as big a one as that which Mr. Bryant was play- <lb/>
<pb n="154"/>
ing to the gallery; we all do it. Carlyle said, in <lb/>
substance, this&#x2014;I do not remember the exact <lb/>
words: "This gospel is eternal&#x2014;that a lie shall <lb/>
not live."</p>
<p>I have a reverent affection for Carlyle's books, <lb/>
and have read his <i>Revolution</i> eight times; and so I <lb/>
prefer to think he was not entirely at himself when <lb/>
he told that one. To me it is plain that he said it in <lb/>
a moment of excitement, when chasing Americans <lb/>
out of his back-yard with brickbats. They used to <lb/>
go there and worship. At bottom he was probably <lb/>
fond of them, but he was always able to conceal it. <lb/>
He kept bricks for them, but he was not a good <lb/>
shot, and it is matter of history that when he fired <lb/>
they dodged, and carried off the brick; for as a <lb/>
nation we like relics, and so long as we get them we <lb/>
do not much care what the reliquary thinks about it. <lb/>
I am quite sure that when he told that large one <lb/>
about a lie not being able to live, he had just missed <lb/>
an American and was over-excited. He told it above <lb/>
thirty years ago, but it is alive yet; alive, and very <lb/>
healthy and hearty, and likely to outlive any fact in <lb/>
history. Carlyle was truthful when calm, but give <lb/>
him Americans enough and bricks enough and he <lb/>
could have taken medals himself.</p>
<p>As regards that time that George Washington told <lb/>
the truth, a word must be said, of course. It is the <lb/>
principal jewel in the crown of America, and it is <lb/>
but natural that we should work it for all it is <lb/>
worth, as Milton says in his "Lay of the Last Min- <lb/>
<pb n="155"/>
strel." It was a timely and judicious truth, and I <lb/>
should have told it myself in the circumstances. <lb/>
But I should have stopped there. It was a stately <lb/>
truth, a lofty truth&#x2014;a Tower; and I think it was a <lb/>
mistake to go on and distract attention from its sub- <lb/>
limity by building another Tower alongside of it <lb/>
fourteen times as high. I refer to his remark that <lb/>
he "could not lie." I should have fed that to the <lb/>
marines: or left it to Carlyle; it is just in his style. <lb/>
It would have taken a medal at any European fair, <lb/>
and would have got an Honorable Mention even at <lb/>
Chicago if it had been saved up. But let it pass: <lb/>
the Father of his Country was excited. I have been <lb/>
in those circumstances, and I recollect.</p>
<p>With the truth he told I have no objection to <lb/>
offer, as already indicated. I think it was not pre- <lb/>
meditated, but an inspiration. With his fine mili- <lb/>
tary mind, he had probably arranged to let his <lb/>
brother Edward in for the cherry-tree results, but <lb/>
by an inspiration he saw his opportunity in time and <lb/>
took advantage of it. By telling the truth he could <lb/>
astonish his father; his father would tell the neigh- <lb/>
bors; the neighbors would spread it; it would travel <lb/>
to all firesides; in the end it would make him Presi- <lb/>
dent, and not only that, but First President. He <lb/>
was a far-seeing boy and would be likely to think of <lb/>
these things. Therefore, to my mind, he stands <lb/>
justified for what he did. But not for the other <lb/>
Tower: it was a mistake. Still, I don't know about <lb/>
that; upon reflection I think perhaps it wasn't. For <lb/>
<pb n="156"/>
indeed it is that Tower that makes the other one live. <lb/>
If he hadn't said "I cannot tell a lie," there would <lb/>
have been no convulsion. That was the earthquake <lb/>
that rocked the planet. That is the kind of state- <lb/>
ment that lives forever, and a fact barnacled to it <lb/>
has a good chance to share its immortality.</p>
<p>To sum up, on the whole I am satisfied with <lb/>
things the way they are. There is a prejudice <lb/>
against the spoken lie, but none against any other, <lb/>
and by examination and mathematical computation <lb/>
I find that the proportion of the spoken lie to the <lb/>
other varieties is as 1 to 22,894. Therefore the <lb/>
spoken lie is of no consequence, and it is not worth <lb/>
while to go around fussing about it and trying to <lb/>
make believe that it is an important matter. The <lb/>
silent colossal National Lie that is the support and <lb/>
confederate of all the tyrannies and shams and in- <lb/>
equalities and unfairnesses that afflict the peoples&#x2014; <lb/>
that is the one to throw bricks and sermons at. But <lb/>
let us be judicious and let somebody else begin.</p>
<p>And then&#x2014; But I have wandered from my text. <lb/>
How did I get out of my second lie? I think I got <lb/>
out with honor, but I cannot be sure, for it was a <lb/>
long time ago and some of the details have faded <lb/>
out of my memory. I recollect that I was reversed <lb/>
and stretched across some one's knee, and that <lb/>
something happened, but I cannot now remember <lb/>
what it was. I think there was music; but it is all <lb/>
dim now and blurred by the lapse of time, and this <lb/>
may be only a senile fancy.</p>

<q>One Fly Makes a Summer.&#x2014;<i>Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar</i></q>
<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head>I.</head>
<p><smcap>A great</smcap> beer-saloon in the Friedrichstrasse, <lb/>
Berlin, toward mid-afternoon. At a hundred <lb/>
round tables gentlemen sat smoking and drinking; <lb/>
flitting here and there and everywhere were white- <lb/>
aproned waiters bearing foaming mugs to the thirsty. <lb/>
At a table near the main entrance were grouped half <lb/>
a dozen lively young fellows&#x2014;American students&#x2014; <lb/>
drinking goodby to a visiting Yale youth on his <lb/>
travels, who had been spending a few days in the <lb/>
German capital.</p>
<p>"But why do you cut your tour short in the <lb/>
middle, Parrish?" asked one of the students. "I <lb/>
wish I had your chance. What do you want to go <lb/>
home for?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said another, "what is the idea? You <lb/>
want to explain, you know, because it looks like in- <lb/>
sanity. Homesick?"</p>
<pb n="158"/>
<p>A girlish blush rose in Parrish's fresh young face, <lb/>
and after a little hesitation he confessed that that <lb/>
was his trouble.</p>
<p>"I was never away from home before," he said, <lb/>
"and every day I get more and more lonesome. I <lb/>
have not seen a friend for weeks, and it's been hor- <lb/>
rible. I meant to stick the trip through, for pride's <lb/>
sake, but seeing you boys has finished me. It's <lb/>
been heaven to me, and I can't take up that com- <lb/>
panionless dreariness again. If I had company&#x2014; <lb/>
but I haven't, you know, so it's no use. They used <lb/>
to call me Miss Nancy when I was a small chap, and <lb/>
I reckon I'm that yet&#x2014;girlish and timorous, and <lb/>
all that. I ought to have <i>been</i> a girl! I can't stand <lb/>
it; I'm going home."</p>
<p>The boys rallied him good-naturedly, and said he <lb/>
was making the mistake of his life; and one of them <lb/>
added that he ought at least to see St. Petersburg <lb/>
before turning back.</p>
<p>"Don't!" said Parrish, appealingly. "It was <lb/>
my dearest dream, and I'm throwing it away. <lb/>
Don't say a word more on that head, for I'm made <lb/>
of water, and can't stand out against anybody's <lb/>
persuasion. I <i>can't</i> go alone; I think I should die." <lb/>
He slapped his breast pocket, and added: "Here <lb/>
is my protection against a change of mind; I've <lb/>
bought ticket and sleeper for Paris, and I leave to- <lb/>
night. Drink, now&#x2014;this is on me&#x2014;bumpers&#x2014; <lb/>
this is for home!"</p>
<pb n="159"/>
<p>The goodbyes were said, and Alfred Parrish was <lb/>
left to his thoughts and his loneliness. But for a <lb/>
moment only. A sturdy middle-aged man with a <lb/>
brisk and businesslike bearing, and an air of decision <lb/>
and confidence suggestive of military training, came <lb/>
bustling from the next table, and seated himself at <lb/>
Parrish's side, and began to speak, with concen- <lb/>
trated interest and earnestness. His eyes, his face, <lb/>
his person, his whole system, seemed to exude <lb/>
energy. He was full of steam&#x2014;racing pressure&#x2014; <lb/>
one could almost hear his gauge-cocks sing. He ex- <lb/>
tended a frank hand, shook Parrish's cordially, and <lb/>
said, with a most convincing air of strenuous convic- <lb/>
tion:</p>
<p>"Ah, but you <i>mustn't;</i> really you mustn't; it <lb/>
would be the greatest mistake; you would always <lb/>
regret it. Be persuaded, I beg you; don't do it&#x2014; <lb/>
don't!"</p>
<p>There was such a friendly note in it, and such a <lb/>
seeming of genuineness, that it brought a sort of up- <lb/>
lift to the youth's despondent spirits, and a telltale <lb/>
moisture betrayed itself in his eyes, an unintentional <lb/>
confession that he was touched and grateful. The <lb/>
alert stranger noted that sign, was quite content with <lb/>
that response, and followed up his advantage <lb/>
without waiting for a spoken one:</p>
<p>"No, don't do it; it would be a mistake. I have <lb/>
heard everything that was said&#x2014;you will pardon <lb/>
that&#x2014;I was so close by that I couldn't help it. <lb/>
<pb n="160"/>
And it troubled me to think that you would cut <lb/>
your travels short when you really <i>want</i> to see St. <lb/>
Petersburg, and are right here almost in sight of it! <lb/>
Reconsider it&#x2014;ah, you <i>must</i> reconsider it. It is <lb/>
such a short distance&#x2014;it is very soon done and <lb/>
very soon over&#x2014;and think what a memory it <lb/>
will be!"</p>
<p>Then he went on and made a picture of the Rus- <lb/>
sian capital and its wonders, which made Alfred <lb/>
Parrish's mouth water and his roused spirits cry out <lb/>
with longing. Then&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Of course you must see St. Petersburg&#x2014;you <lb/>
<i>must!</i> Why, it will be a joy to you&#x2014;a joy! I <lb/>
know, because I know the place as familiarly as I <lb/>
know my own birthplace in America. Ten years&#x2014; <lb/>
I've known it ten years. Ask anybody there; <lb/>
they'll tell you; they all know me&#x2014;Major Jackson. <lb/>
The very dogs know me. Do go; oh, you must <lb/>
go; you must, indeed."</p>
<p>Alfred Parrish was quivering with eagerness now. <lb/>
He would go. His face said it as plainly as his <lb/>
tongue could have done it. Then&#x2014;the old shadow <lb/>
fell, and he said, sorrowfully:</p>
<p>"Oh no&#x2014;no, it's no use; I can't. I should die <lb/>
of the loneliness."</p>
<p>The Major said, with astonishment: "The&#x2014; <lb/>
loneliness! Why, I'm going <i>with</i> you!"</p>
<p>It was startlingly unexpected. And not quite <lb/>
pleasant. Things were moving too rapidly. Was <lb/>
<pb n="161"/>
this a trap? Was this stranger a sharper? Whence <lb/>
all this gratuitous interest in a wandering and un- <lb/>
known lad? Then he glanced at the Major's frank <lb/>
and winning and beaming face, and was ashamed; <lb/>
and wished he knew how to get out of this scrape <lb/>
without hurting the feelings of its contriver. But he <lb/>
was not handy in matters of diplomacy, and went at <lb/>
the difficulty with conscious awkwardness and small <lb/>
confidence. He said, with a quite overdone show of <lb/>
unselfishness:</p>
<p>"Oh no, no, you are too kind; I couldn't&#x2014;I <lb/>
couldn't allow you to put yourself to such an incon- <lb/>
venience on my&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Inconvenience? None in the world, my boy; I <lb/>
was going to-night, anyway; I leave in the express <lb/>
at nine. Come! we'll go together. You sha'n't <lb/>
be lonely a single minute. Come along&#x2014;say the <lb/>
word!"</p>
<p>So that excuse had failed. What to do now? <lb/>
Parrish was disheartened; it seemed to him that no <lb/>
subterfuge which his poor invention could contrive <lb/>
would ever rescue him from these toils. Still, he <lb/>
must make another effort, and he did; and before <lb/>
he had finished his new excuse he thought he recog- <lb/>
nized that it was unanswerable:</p>
<p>"Ah, but most unfortunately luck is against me, <lb/>
and it is impossible. Look at these"&#x2014;and he <lb/>
took out his tickets and laid them on the table. <lb/>
"I am booked through to Paris, and I couldn't get <lb/>
<pb n="162"/>
these tickets and baggage coupons changed for St. <lb/>
Petersburg, of course, and would have to lose the <lb/>
money; and if I could afford to lose the money I <lb/>
should be rather short after I bought the new tickets <lb/>
&#x2014;for there is all the cash I've got about me"&#x2014; <lb/>
and he laid a five-hundred-mark bank-note on the <lb/>
table.</p>
<p>In a moment the Major had the tickets and cou- <lb/>
pons and was on his feet, and saying, with enthu- <lb/>
siasm:</p>
<p>"Good! It's all right, and everything safe. <lb/>
They'll change the tickets and baggage pasters for <lb/>
<i>me;</i> they all know me&#x2014;everybody knows me. <lb/>
Sit right where you are; I'll be back right away." <lb/>
Then he reached for the bank-note, and added, "I'll <lb/>
take this along, for there will be a little extra pay <lb/>
on the new tickets, maybe"&#x2014;and the next moment <lb/>
he was flying out at the door.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="II">
<head>II.</head>
<p>Alfred Parrish was paralyzed. It was all so <lb/>
sudden. So sudden, so daring, so incredible, so <lb/>
impossible. His mouth was open, but his tongue <lb/>
wouldn't work; he tried to shout "Stop him," <lb/>
but his lungs were empty; he wanted to pur- <lb/>
sue, but his legs refused to do anything but <lb/>
tremble; then they gave way under him and let <lb/>
<pb n="163"/>
him down into his chair. His throat was dry, he <lb/>
was gasping and swallowing with dismay, his head <lb/>
was in a whirl. What must he do? He did not <lb/>
know. One thing seemed plain, however&#x2014;he must <lb/>
pull himself together, and try to overtake that man. <lb/>
Of course the man could not get back the ticket- <lb/>
money, but would he throw the tickets away on that <lb/>
account? No; he would certainly go to the station <lb/>
and sell them to some one at half-price; and to-day, <lb/>
too, for they would be worthless to-morrow, by Ger- <lb/>
man custom. These reflections gave him hope and <lb/>
strength, and he rose and started. But he took only <lb/>
a couple of steps, then he felt a sudden sickness, <lb/>
and tottered back to his chair again, weak with a <lb/>
dread that his movement had been noticed&#x2014;for the <lb/>
last round of beer was at his expense; it had not <lb/>
been paid for, and he hadn't a pfennig. He was a <lb/>
prisoner&#x2014;Heaven only could know what might <lb/>
happen if he tried to leave the place. He was timid, <lb/>
scared, crushed; and he had not German enough to <lb/>
state his case and beg for help and indulgence.</p>
<p>Then his thoughts began to persecute him. How <lb/>
could he have been such a fool? What possessed <lb/>
him to listen to such a manifest adventurer? <i>And <lb/>
here comes the waiter!</i> He buried himself in the <lb/>
newspaper&#x2014;trembling. The waiter passed by. It <lb/>
filled him with thankfulness. The hands of the clock <lb/>
seemed to stand still, yet he could not keep his eyes <lb/>
from them.</p>
<pb n="164"/>
<p>Ten minutes dragged by. The waiter again! <lb/>
Again he hid behind the paper. The waiter paused <lb/>
&#x2014;apparently a week&#x2014;then passed on.</p>
<p>Another ten minutes of misery&#x2014;once more the <lb/>
waiter; this time he wiped off the table, and seemed <lb/>
to be a month at it; then paused two months, and <lb/>
went away.</p>
<p>Parrish felt that he could not endure another visit; <lb/>
he must take the chances: he must run the gauntlet; <lb/>
he must escape. But the waiter stayed around about <lb/>
the neighborhood for five minutes&#x2014;months and <lb/>
months seemingly, Parrish watching him with a <lb/>
despairing eye, and feeling the infirmities of age <lb/>
creeping upon him and his hair gradually turning <lb/>
gray.</p>
<p>At last the waiter wandered away&#x2014;stopped at a <lb/>
table, collected a bill, wandered farther, collected <lb/>
another bill, wandered farther&#x2014;Parrish's praying <lb/>
eye riveted on him all the time, his heart thumping, <lb/>
his breath coming and going in quick little gasps of <lb/>
anxiety mixed with hope.</p>
<p>The waiter stopped again to collect, and Parrish <lb/>
said to himself, it is now or never! and started for <lb/>
the door. One step&#x2014;two steps&#x2014;three&#x2014;four <lb/>
&#x2014;he was nearing the door&#x2014;five&#x2014;his legs shaking <lb/>
under him&#x2014;was that a swift step behind him?&#x2014; <lb/>
the thought shriveled his heart&#x2014;six steps&#x2014;seven, <lb/>
and he was out!&#x2014;eight&#x2014;nine&#x2014;ten&#x2014;eleven&#x2014; <lb/>
twelve&#x2014;there <i>is</i> a pursuing step!&#x2014;he turned the <lb/>
<pb n="165"/>
corner, and picked up his heels to fly&#x2014;a heavy <lb/>
hand fell on his shoulder, and the strength went out <lb/>
of his body!</p>
<p>It was the Major. He asked not a question, he <lb/>
showed no surprise. He said, in his breezy and ex- <lb/>
hilarating fashion:</p>
<p>"Confound those people, they delayed me; <lb/>
that's why I was gone so long. New man in the <lb/>
ticket-office, and he didn't know me, and wouldn't <lb/>
make the exchange because it was irregular; so I <lb/>
had to hunt up my old friend, the great mogul&#x2014; <lb/>
the station-master, you know&#x2014;hi, there, cab! cab! <lb/>
&#x2014;jump in, Parrish!&#x2014;Russian consulate, cabby, <lb/>
and let them fly!&#x2014;so, as I say, that all cost time. <lb/>
But it's all right now, and everything straight; <lb/>
your luggage reweighed, rechecked, fare-ticket and <lb/>
sleeper changed, and I've got the documents for it in <lb/>
my pocket; also the change&#x2014;I'll keep it for you. <lb/>
Whoop along, cabby, whoop along; don't let them <lb/>
go to sleep!"</p>
<p>Poor Parrish was trying his best to get in a word <lb/>
edgeways, as the cab flew farther and farther from <lb/>
the bilked beer-hall, and now at last he succeeded, <lb/>
and wanted to return at once and pay his little bill.</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind about that," said the Major, <lb/>
placidly; "that's all right, they know me, every <lb/>
body knows me&#x2014;I'll square it next time I'm in <lb/>
Berlin&#x2014;push along, cabby, push along&#x2014;no great <lb/>
lot of time to spare, now."</p>
<pb n="166"/>
<p>They arrived at the Russian consulate, a moment <lb/>
after-hours, and hurried in. No one there but a <lb/>
clerk. The Major laid his card on the desk, and <lb/>
said, in the Russian tongue, "Now, then, if you'll <lb/>
vis&#x00E9; this young man's passport for Petersburg as <lb/>
quickly as&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"But, dear sir, I'm not authorized, and the con- <lb/>
sul has just gone."</p>
<p>"Gone where?"</p>
<p>"Out in the country, where he lives."</p>
<p>"And he'll be back&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Not till morning."</p>
<p>"Thunder! Oh, well, look here, I'm Major <lb/>
Jackson&#x2014;he knows me, everybody knows me. <lb/>
You vis&#x00E9; it yourself; tell him Major Jackson asked <lb/>
you; it'll be all right."</p>
<p>But it would be desperately and fatally irregular; <lb/>
the clerk could not be persuaded; he almost fainted <lb/>
at the idea.</p>
<p>"Well, then, I'll tell you what you do," said the <lb/>
Major. "Here's stamps and the fee&#x2014;vis&#x00E9; it in the <lb/>
morning, and start it along by mail."</p>
<p>The clerk said, dubiously, "He&#x2014;well, he may <lb/>
perhaps do it, and so&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"May? He <i>will!</i> He knows me&#x2014;everybody <lb/>
knows me."</p>
<p>"Very well," said the clerk, "I will tell him what <lb/>
you say." He looked bewildered, and in a measure <lb/>
subjugated; and added, timidly: "But&#x2014;but&#x2014;you <lb/>
<pb n="167"/>
know you will beat it to the frontier twenty-four <lb/>
hours. There are no accommodations there for so <lb/>
long a wait."</p>
<p>"Who's going to <i>wait?</i> Not I, if the court <lb/>
knows herself."</p>
<p>The clerk was temporarily paralyzed, and said, <lb/>
"Surely, sir, you don't wish it sent to Petersburg!"</p>
<p>"And why not?"</p>
<p>"And the owner of it tarrying at the frontier, <lb/>
twenty-five miles away? It couldn't do him any <lb/>
good, in those circumstances."</p>
<p>"Tarry&#x2014;the mischief! Who said he was going <lb/>
to do any tarrying?"</p>
<p>"Why, you know, of course, they'll stop him at <lb/>
the frontier if he has no passport."</p>
<p>"Indeed they won't! The Chief Inspector knows <lb/>
me&#x2014;everybody does. I'll be responsible for the <lb/>
young man. You send it straight through to Peters- <lb/>
burg&#x2014;H&#x00F4;tel de l'Europe, care Major Jackson: tell <lb/>
the consul not to worry, I'm taking all the risks <lb/>
myself."</p>
<p>The clerk hesitated, then chanced one more <lb/>
appeal:</p>
<p>"You must bear in mind, sir, that the risks are <lb/>
peculiarly serious, just now. The new edict is in <lb/>
force."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Ten years in Siberia for being in Russia without <lb/>
a passport."</p>
<pb n="168"/>
<p>"Mm&#x2014;damnation!" He said it in English, for <lb/>
the Russian tongue is but a poor stand-by in spiritual <lb/>
emergencies. He mused a moment, then brisked <lb/>
up and resumed in Russian: "Oh, it's all right&#x2014; <lb/>
label her St. Petersburg and let her sail! I'll fix it. <lb/>
They all know me there&#x2014;all the authorities&#x2014; <lb/>
everybody."</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="chapter" n="III">
<head><b>III.</b></head>
<p>The Major turned out to be an adorable traveling <lb/>
companion, and young Parrish was charmed with <lb/>
him. His talk was sunshine and rainbows, and lit <lb/>
up the whole region around, and kept it gay and <lb/>
happy and cheerful; and he was full of accommoda- <lb/>
ting ways, and knew all about how to do things, and <lb/>
when to do them, and the best way. So the long <lb/>
journey was a fairy dream for that young lad who <lb/>
had been so lonely and forlorn and friendless so <lb/>
many homesick weeks. At last, when the two <lb/>
travelers were approaching the frontier, Parrish said <lb/>
something about passports; then started, as if recol- <lb/>
lecting something, and added:</p>
<p>"Why, come to think, I don't remember your <lb/>
bringing my passport away from the consulate. <lb/>
But you did, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"No; it's coming by mail," said the Major, com- <lb/>
fortably.</p>
<pb n="169"/>
<p>"K&#x2014;coming&#x2014;by&#x2014;mail!" gasped the lad; <lb/>
and all the dreadful things he had heard about the <lb/>
terrors and disasters of passportless visitors to <lb/>
Russia rose in his frightened mind and turned him <lb/>
white to the lips. "Oh, Major&#x2014;oh, my goodness, <lb/>
what will become of me! How <i>could</i> you do such a <lb/>
thing?"</p>
<p>The Major laid a soothing hand upon the youth's <lb/>
shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Now don't you worry, my boy, don't you worry <lb/>
a bit. I'm taking care of you, and I'm not going <lb/>
to let any harm come to you. The Chief Inspector <lb/>
knows me, and I'll explain to him, and it'll be all <lb/>
right&#x2014;you'll see. Now don't you give yourself <lb/>
the least discomfort&#x2014;I'll fix it all up, easy as <lb/>
nothing."</p>
<p>Alfred trembled, and felt a great sinking inside, <lb/>
but he did what he could to conceal his misery, and <lb/>
to respond with some show of heart to the Major's <lb/>
kindly pettings and reassurings.</p>
<p>At the frontier he got out and stood on the edge <lb/>
of the great crowd, and waited in deep anxiety <lb/>
while the Major plowed his way through the mass <lb/>
to "explain to the Chief Inspector." It seemed a <lb/>
cruelly long wait, but at last the Major reappeared. <lb/>
He said, cheerfully, "Damnation, it's a new in- <lb/>
spector, and I don't know him!"</p>
<p>Alfred fell up against a pile of trunks, with a des- <lb/>
pairing, "Oh, dear, dear, I might have known it!" <lb/>
<pb n="170"/>
and was slumping limp and helpless to the ground, <lb/>
but the Major gathered him up and seated him on a <lb/>
box, and sat down by him, with a supporting arm <lb/>
around him, and whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>"Don't worry, laddie, don't&#x2014;it's going to be <lb/>
all right; you just trust to me. The sub-inspector's <lb/>
as near-sighted as a shad. I watched him, and I <lb/>
know it's so. Now I'll tell you how to do. I'll go <lb/>
and get my passport chalked, then I'll stop right <lb/>
yonder inside the grille where you see those peasants <lb/>
with their packs. You be there, and I'll back up <lb/>
against the grille, and slip my passport to you <lb/>
through the bars, then you tag along after the <lb/>
crowd and hand it in, and trust to Providence and <lb/>
that shad. Mainly the shad. You'll pull through <lb/>
all right&#x2014;now don't you be afraid."</p>
<p>"But, oh dear, dear, <i>your</i> description and <i>mine</i> <lb/>
don't tally any more than&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right&#x2014;difference between fifty- <lb/>
one and nineteen&#x2014;just entirely imperceptible to <lb/>
that shad&#x2014;don't you fret, it's going to come out <lb/>
as right as nails."</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Alfred was tottering toward the <lb/>
train, pale, and in a collapse, but he had played the <lb/>
shad successfully, and was as grateful as an untaxed <lb/>
dog that has evaded the police.</p>
<p>"I told you so," said the Major, in splendid <lb/>
spirits. "I knew it would come out all right if you <lb/>
trusted in Providence like a little trusting child and <lb/>
<pb n="171"/>
didn't try to improve on His ideas&#x2014;it always <lb/>
does."</p>
<p>Between the frontier and Petersburg the Major laid <lb/>
himself out to restore his young comrade's life, and <lb/>
work up his circulation, and pull him out of his des- <lb/>
pondency, and make him feel again that life was a <lb/>
joy and worth living. And so, as a consequence, <lb/>
the young fellow entered the city in high feather and <lb/>
marched into the hotel in fine form, and registered <lb/>
his name. But instead of naming a room, the <lb/>
clerk glanced at him inquiringly, and waited. The <lb/>
Major came promptly to the rescue, and said, cor- <lb/>
dially:</p>
<p>"It's all right&#x2014;you know me&#x2014;set him down, <lb/>
I'm responsible." The clerk looked grave, and <lb/>
shook his head. The Major added: "It's all right, <lb/>
it'll be here in twenty-four hours&#x2014;it's coming <lb/>
by mail. Here's mine, and his is coming, right <lb/>
along."</p>
<p>The clerk was full of politeness, full of deference, <lb/>
but he was firm. He said, in English:</p>
<p>"Indeed, I wish I could accommodate you, <lb/>
Major, and certainly I would if I could; but I have <lb/>
no choice, I must ask him to go; I cannot allow him <lb/>
to remain in the house a moment."</p>
<p>Parrish began to totter, and emitted a moan; the <lb/>
Major caught him and stayed him with an arm, and <lb/>
said to the clerk, appealingly:</p>
<p>"Come, you know me&#x2014;everybody does&#x2014;just <lb/>
<pb n="172"/>
let him stay here the one night, and I give you my <lb/>
word&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The clerk shook his head, and said:</p>
<p>"But, Major, you are endangering me, you are <lb/>
endangering the house. I&#x2014;I hate to do such a <lb/>
thing, but I&#x2014;I <i>must</i> call the police."</p>
<p>"Hold on, don't do that. Come along, my boy, <lb/>
and don't you fret&#x2014;it's going to come out all <lb/>
right. Hi, there, cabby! Jump in, Parrish. <lb/>
Palace of the General of the Secret Police&#x2014;turn <lb/>
them loose, cabby! Let them go! Make them <lb/>
whiz! Now we're off, and don't you give yourself <lb/>
any uneasiness. Prince Bossloffsky knows me, <lb/>
knows me like a book; he'll soon fix things all right <lb/>
for us."</p>
<p>They tore through the gay streets and arrived at <lb/>
the palace, which was brilliantly lighted. But it was <lb/>
half past eight; the Prince was about going in to <lb/>
dinner, the sentinel said, and couldn't receive any <lb/>
one.</p>
<p>"But he'll receive <i>me</i>," said the Major, robustly, <lb/>
and handed his card. "I'm Major Jackson. Send <lb/>
it in; it'll be all right."</p>
<p>The card was sent in, under protest, and the Major <lb/>
and his waif waited in a reception-room for some <lb/>
time. At length they were sent for, and conducted <lb/>
to a sumptuous private office and confronted with <lb/>
the Prince, who stood there gorgeously arrayed and <lb/>
frowning like a thunder-cloud. The Major stated <lb/>
<pb n="173"/>
his case, and begged for a twenty-four-hour stay of <lb/>
proceedings until the passport should be forthcom- <lb/>
ing.</p>
<p>"Oh, impossible!" said the Prince, in faultless <lb/>
English. "I marvel that you should have done so <lb/>
insane a thing as to bring the lad into the country <lb/>
without a passport, Major, I marvel at it; why, it's <lb/>
ten years in Siberia, and no help for it&#x2014;catch him! <lb/>
support him!" for poor Parrish was making another <lb/>
trip to the floor. "Here&#x2014;quick, give him this. <lb/>
There&#x2014;take another draught; brandy's the thing, <lb/>
don't you find it so, lad? Now you feel better, poor <lb/>
fellow. Lie down on the sofa. How stupid it was <lb/>
of you, Major, to get him into such a horrible <lb/>
scrape."</p>
<p>The Major eased the boy down with his strong <lb/>
arms, put a cushion under his head, and whispered <lb/>
in his ear:</p>
<p>"Look as damned sick as you can! Play it for <lb/>
all it's worth; he's touched, you see; got a tender <lb/>
heart under there somewhere; fetch a groan, and <lb/>
say, 'Oh, mamma, mamma'; it'll knock him out, <lb/>
sure as guns."</p>
<p>Parrish was going to do these things anyway, <lb/>
from native impulse, so they came from him <lb/>
promptly, with great and moving sincerity, and the <lb/>
Major whispered: "Splendid! Do it again; Bern- <lb/>
hardt couldn't beat it."</p>
<p>What with the Major's eloquence and the boy's <lb/>
<pb n="174"/>
misery, the point was gained at last; the Prince <lb/>
struck his colors, and said:</p>
<p>"Have it your way; though you deserve a sharp <lb/>
lesson and you ought to get it. I give you exactly <lb/>
twenty-four hours. If the passport is not here <lb/>
then, don't come near me; it's Siberia without hope <lb/>
of pardon."</p>
<p>While the Major and the lad poured out their <lb/>
thanks, the Prince rang in a couple of soldiers, and <lb/>
in their own language he ordered them to go with <lb/>
these two people, and not lose sight of the younger <lb/>
one a moment for the next twenty-four hours; and <lb/>
if, at the end of that term, the boy could not show a <lb/>
passport, impound him in the dungeons of St. Peter <lb/>
and St. Paul, and report.</p>
<p>The unfortunates arrived at the hotel with their <lb/>
guards, dined under their eyes, remained in Parrish's <lb/>
room until the Major went off to bed, after cheering <lb/>
up the said Parrish, then one of the soldiers locked <lb/>
himself and Parrish in, and the other one stretched <lb/>
himself across the door outside and soon went off to <lb/>
sleep.</p>
<p>So also did not Alfred Parrish. The moment he <lb/>
was alone with the solemn soldier and the voiceless <lb/>
silence his machine-made cheerfulness began to waste <lb/>
away, his medicated courage began to give off its <lb/>
supporting gases and shrink toward normal, and his <lb/>
poor little heart to shrivel like a raisin. Within <lb/>
thirty minutes he struck bottom; grief, misery, <lb/>
<pb n="175"/>
fright, despair, could go no lower. Bed? Bed was <lb/>
not for such as he; bed was not for the doomed, the <lb/>
lost! Sleep? He was not the Hebrew children, he <lb/>
could not sleep in the fire! He could only walk <lb/>
the floor. And not only could, but must. And did, <lb/>
by the hour. And mourned, and wept, and shud- <lb/>
dered, and prayed.</p>
<p>Then all-sorrowfully he made his last dispositions, <lb/>
and prepared himself, as well as in him lay, to meet <lb/>
his fate. As a final act, he wrote a letter:</p>
<p>"<smcap>My darling Mother</smcap>,&#x2014;When these sad lines <lb/>
shall have reached you your poor Alfred will be no <lb/>
more. No; worse than that, far worse! Through <lb/>
my own fault and foolishness I have fallen into the <lb/>
hands of a sharper or a lunatic; I do not know <lb/>
which, but in either case I feel that I am lost. <lb/>
Sometimes I think he is a sharper, but most of the <lb/>
time I think he is only mad, for he has a kind, good <lb/>
heart, I know, and he certainly seems to try the <lb/>
hardest that ever a person tried to get me out of the <lb/>
fatal difficulties he has gotten me into.</p>
<p>"In a few hours I shall be one of a nameless <lb/>
horde plodding the snowy solitudes of Russia, under <lb/>
the lash, and bound for that land of mystery and <lb/>
misery and termless oblivion, Siberia! I shall not <lb/>
live to see it; my heart is broken and I shall die. <lb/>
Give my picture to <i>her</i>, and ask her to keep it in <lb/>
memory of me, and to so live that in the appointed <lb/>
time she may join me in that better world where <lb/>
<pb n="176"/>
there is no marriage nor giving in marriage, and <lb/>
where there are no more separations, and troubles <lb/>
never come. Give my yellow dog to Archy Hale, <lb/>
and the other one to Henry Taylor; my blazer I <lb/>
give to brother Will, and my fishing things and <lb/>
Bible.</p>
<p>"There is no hope for me. I cannot escape; <lb/>
the soldier stands there with his gun and never takes <lb/>
his eyes off me, just blinks; there is no other move- <lb/>
ment, any more than if he was dead. I cannot bribe <lb/>
him, the maniac has my money. My letter of credit <lb/>
is in my trunk, and may never come&#x2014;<i>will</i> never <lb/>
come, I know. Oh, what is to become of me! <lb/>
Pray for me, darling mother, pray for your poor <lb/>
Alfred. But it will do no good."</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="IV">
<head>IV.</head>
<p>In the morning Alfred came out looking scraggy <lb/>
and worn when the Major summoned him to an <lb/>
early breakfast. They fed their guards, they lit <lb/>
cigars, the Major loosened his tongue and set it go- <lb/>
ing, and under its magic influence Alfred gradually <lb/>
and gratefully became hopeful, measurably cheerful, <lb/>
and almost happy once more.</p>
<p>But he would not leave the house. Siberia hung <lb/>
over him black and threatening, his appetite for <lb/>
sights was all gone, he could not have borne the <lb/>
<pb n="177"/>
shame of inspecting streets and galleries and churches <lb/>
with a soldier at each elbow and all the world stop- <lb/>
ping and staring and commenting&#x2014;no, he would <lb/>
stay within and wait for the Berlin mail and his fate. <lb/>
So, all day long the Major stood gallantly by him <lb/>
in his room, with one soldier standing stiff and <lb/>
motionless against the door with his musket at his <lb/>
shoulder, and the other one drowsing in a chair out- <lb/>
side; and all day long the faithful veteran spun <lb/>
campaign yarns, described battles, reeled off explo- <lb/>
sive anecdotes, with unconquerable energy and <lb/>
sparkle and resolution, and kept the scared student <lb/>
alive and his pulses functioning. The long day wore <lb/>
to a close, and the pair, followed by their guards, <lb/>
went down to the great dining-room and took their <lb/>
seats.</p>
<p>"The suspense will be over before long, now," <lb/>
sighed poor Alfred.</p>
<p>Just then a pair of Englishmen passed by, and one <lb/>
of them said, "So we'll get no letters from Berlin <lb/>
to-night."</p>
<p>Parrish's breath began to fail him. The English- <lb/>
men seated themselves at a near-by table, and the <lb/>
other one said:</p>
<p>"No, it isn't as bad as that." Parrish's breath- <lb/>
ing improved. "There is later telegraphic news. <lb/>
The accident did detain the train formidably, but <lb/>
that is all. It will arrive here three hours late to- <lb/>
night."</p>
<pb n="178"/>
<p>Parrish did not get to the floor this time, for the <lb/>
Major jumped for him in time. He had been listen- <lb/>
ing, and foresaw what would happen. He patted <lb/>
Parrish on the back, hoisted him out of his chair, <lb/>
and said, cheerfully:</p>
<p>"Come along, my boy, cheer up, there's abso- <lb/>
lutely nothing to worry about. I know a way out. <lb/>
Bother the passport; let it lag a week if it wants <lb/>
to, we can do without it."</p>
<p>Parrish was too sick to hear him; hope was gone, <lb/>
Siberia present; he moved off on legs of lead, up- <lb/>
held by the Major, who walked him to the American <lb/>
legation, heartening him on the way with assurances <lb/>
that on his recommendation the minister wouldn't <lb/>
hesitate a moment to grant him a new passport.</p>
<p>"I had that card up my sleeve all the time," he <lb/>
said. "The minister knows me&#x2014;knows me famil- <lb/>
iarly&#x2014;chummed together hours and hours under a <lb/>
pile of other wounded at Cold Harbor; been chum- <lb/>
mies ever since, in spirit, though we haven't met <lb/>
much in the body. Cheer up, laddie, everything's <lb/>
looking splendid! By gracious! I feel as cocky as <lb/>
a buck angel. Here we are, and our troubles are at <lb/>
an end! If we ever really had any."</p>
<p>There, alongside the door, was the trade-mark of <lb/>
the richest and freest and mightiest republic of all <lb/>
the ages: the pine disk, with the planked eagle <lb/>
spread upon it, his head and shoulders among the <lb/>
stars, and his claws full of out-of-date war material; <lb/>
<pb n="179"/>
and at that sight the tears came into Alfred's eyes, <lb/>
the pride of country rose in his heart, Hail Columbia <lb/>
boomed up in his breast, and all his fears and sor- <lb/>
rows vanished away; for here he was safe, safe! not <lb/>
all the powers of the earth would venture to cross <lb/>
that threshold to lay a hand upon him!</p>
<p>For economy's sake the mightiest republic's lega- <lb/>
tions in Europe consist of a room and a half on the <lb/>
ninth floor, when the tenth is occupied, and the lega- <lb/>
tion furniture consists of a minister or an ambassador <lb/>
with a brakeman's salary, a secretary of legation <lb/>
who sells matches and mends crockery for a living, <lb/>
a hired girl for interpreter and general utility, <lb/>
pictures of the American liners, a chromo of the <lb/>
reigning President, a desk, three chairs, kerosene- <lb/>
lamp, a cat, a clock, and a cuspidor with motto, <lb/>
"In God We Trust."</p>
<p>The party climbed up there, followed by the <lb/>
escort. A man sat at the desk writing official things <lb/>
on wrapping-paper with a nail. He rose and faced <lb/>
about; the cat climbed down and got under the <lb/>
desk; the hired girl squeezed herself up into the <lb/>
corner by the vodka-jug to make room; the soldiers <lb/>
squeezed themselves up against the wall alongside <lb/>
of her, with muskets at shoulder arms. Alfred was <lb/>
radiant with happiness and the sense of rescue. <lb/>
The Major cordially shook hands with the official, <lb/>
rattled off his case in easy and fluent style, and asked <lb/>
for the desired passport.</p>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>The official seated his guests, then said: "Well, <lb/>
I am only the secretary of legation, you know, and <lb/>
I wouldn't like to grant a passport while the minister <lb/>
is on Russian soil. There is far too much responsi- <lb/>
bility."</p>
<p>"All right, send for him."</p>
<p>The secretary smiled, and said: "That's easier <lb/>
said than done. He's away up in the wilds, some- <lb/>
where, on his vacation."</p>
<p>"Ger-reat Scott!" ejaculated the Major.</p>
<p>Alfred groaned; the color went out of his face, <lb/>
and he began to slowly collapse in his clothes. The <lb/>
secretary said, wonderingly:</p>
<p>"Why, what are you Great-Scotting about, <lb/>
Major? The Prince gave you twenty-four hours. <lb/>
Look at the clock; you're all right; you've half an <lb/>
hour left; the train is just due; the passport will <lb/>
arrive in time."</p>
<p>"Man, there's news! The train is three hours <lb/>
behind time! This boy's life and liberty are wast- <lb/>
ing away by minutes, and only thirty of them left! <lb/>
In half an hour he's the same as dead and damned <lb/>
to all eternity! By God, we <i>must</i> have the pass- <lb/>
port!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am dying, I know it!" wailed the lad, <lb/>
and buried his face in his arms on the desk. A <lb/>
quick change came over the secretary, his placidity <lb/>
vanished away, excitement flamed up in his face and <lb/>
eyes, and he exclaimed:</p>
<pb n="181"/>
<p>"I see the whole ghastliness of the situation, but, <lb/>
Lord help us, what can I do? What can you <lb/>
suggest?"</p>
<p>"Why, hang it, give him the passport!"</p>
<p>"Impossible! totally impossible! You know <lb/>
nothing about him; three days ago you had never <lb/>
heard of him; there's no way in the world to identify <lb/>
him. He is lost, lost&#x2014;there's no possibility of sav- <lb/>
ing him!"</p>
<p>The boy groaned again, and sobbed out, "Lord, <lb/>
Lord, it's the last of earth for Alfred Parrish!"</p>
<p>Another change came over the secretary.</p>
<p>In the midst of a passionate outburst of pity, vex- <lb/>
ation, and hopelessness, he stopped short, his man- <lb/>
ner calmed down, and he asked, in the indifferent <lb/>
voice which one uses in introducing the subject of <lb/>
the weather when there is nothing to talk about, "Is <lb/>
that your name?"</p>
<p>The youth sobbed out a yes.</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Bridgeport."</p>
<p>The secretary shook his head&#x2014;shook it again&#x2014; <lb/>
and muttered to himself. After a moment:</p>
<p>"Born there?"</p>
<p>"No; New Haven."</p>
<p>"Ah-h." The secretary glanced at the Major, <lb/>
who was listening intently, with blank and unenlight- <lb/>
ened face, and indicated rather than said, "There is <lb/>
vodka there, in case the soldiers are thirsty." The <lb/>
<pb n="182"/>
Major sprang up, poured for them, and received <lb/>
their gratitude. The questioning went on.</p>
<p>"How long did you live in New Haven?"</p>
<p>"Till I was fourteen. Came back two years ago <lb/>
to enter Yale."</p>
<p>"When you lived there, what street did you live <lb/>
on?"</p>
<p>"Parker Street."</p>
<p>With a vague half-light of comprehension dawning <lb/>
in his eye, the Major glanced an inquiry at the sec- <lb/>
retary. The secretary nodded, the Major poured <lb/>
vodka again.</p>
<p>"What number?"</p>
<p>"It hadn't any."</p>
<p>The boy sat up and gave the secretary a pathetic <lb/>
look which said, "Why do you want to torture me <lb/>
with these foolish things, when I am miserable <lb/>
enough without it?"</p>
<p>The secretary went on, unheeding: "What kind <lb/>
of a house was it?"</p>
<p>"Brick&#x2014;two story."</p>
<p>"Flush with the sidewalk?"</p>
<p>"No, small yard in front."</p>
<p>"Iron fence?"</p>
<p>"No, palings."</p>
<p>The Major poured vodka again&#x2014;without instruc- <lb/>
tions&#x2014;poured brimmers this time; and his face had <lb/>
cleared and was alive now.</p>
<p>"What do you see when you enter the door?"</p>
<pb n="183"/>
<p>"A narrow hall; door at the end of it, and a <lb/>
door at your right."</p>
<p>"Anything else?"</p>
<p>"Hat-rack."</p>
<p>"Room at the right?"</p>
<p>"Parlor."</p>
<p>"Carpet?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Kind of carpet?"</p>
<p>"Old-fashioned Wilton."</p>
<p>"Figures?"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;hawking-party, horseback."</p>
<p>The Major cast an eye at the clock&#x2014;only six <lb/>
minutes left! He faced about with the jug, and as <lb/>
he poured he glanced at the secretary, then at the <lb/>
clock&#x2014;inquiringly. The secretary nodded; the <lb/>
Major covered the clock from view with his body a <lb/>
moment, and set the hands back half an hour; then <lb/>
he refreshed the men&#x2014;double rations.</p>
<p>"Room beyond the hall and hat-rack?"</p>
<p>"Dining-room."</p>
<p>"Stove?"</p>
<p>"Grate."</p>
<p>"Did your people own the house?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do they own it yet?"</p>
<p>"No; sold it when we moved to Bridgeport."</p>
<p>The secretary paused a little, then said, "Did you <lb/>
have a nickname among your playmates?"</p>
<pb n="184"/>
<p>The color slowly rose in the youth's pale cheeks, <lb/>
and he dropped his eyes. He seemed to struggle <lb/>
with himself a moment or two, then he said, plain- <lb/>
tively, "They called me Miss Nancy."</p>
<p>The secretary mused awhile, then he dug up <lb/>
another question:</p>
<p>"Any ornaments in the dining-room?"</p>
<p>"Well, y&#x2014;no."</p>
<p>"<i>None?</i> None at <i>all?</i>"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"The mischief! Isn't that a little odd? Think!"</p>
<p>The youth thought and thought; the secretary <lb/>
waited, slightly panting. At last the imperiled waif <lb/>
looked up sadly and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Think&#x2014;<i>think!</i>" cried the Major, in anxious <lb/>
solicitude; and poured again.</p>
<p>"Come!" said the secretary, "not even a <lb/>
<i>picture?</i>"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly! but you said ornament."</p>
<p>"Ah! What did your father think of it?"</p>
<p>The color rose again. The boy was silent.</p>
<p>"Speak," said the secretary.</p>
<p>"Speak," cried the Major, and his trembling hand <lb/>
poured more vodka outside the glasses than inside.</p>
<p>"I&#x2014;I can't tell you what he said," murmured <lb/>
the boy.</p>
<p>"Quick! quick!" said the secretary; "out with <lb/>
it; there's no time to lose&#x2014;home and liberty or <lb/>
Siberia and death depend upon the answer."</p>
<pb n="185"/>
<p>"Oh, have pity! he is a clergyman, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No matter; out with it, or&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"He said it was the hellfiredest nightmare he ever <lb/>
struck!"</p>
<p>"Saved!" shouted the secretary, and seized his <lb/>
nail and a blank passport. "<i>I</i> identify you; I've <lb/>
lived in the house, and I painted the picture my- <lb/>
self!"</p>
<p>"Oh, come to my arms, my poor rescued boy!" <lb/>
cried the Major. "We will always be grateful to <lb/>
God that He made this artist!&#x2014;if He did."</p>

<head><b>TWO LITTLE TALES</b></head>
<div3 type="section">
<head><smcap>first story: the man with a message for the <lb/>
director-general</smcap></head>
<p><smcap>Some</smcap> days ago, in this second month of 1900, <lb/>
a friend made an afternoon call upon me here <lb/>
in London. We are of that age when men who are <lb/>
smoking away their time in chat do not talk quite so <lb/>
much about the pleasantnesses of life as about its <lb/>
exasperations. By and by this friend began to <lb/>
abuse the War Office. It appeared that he had a <lb/>
friend who had been inventing something which <lb/>
could be made very useful to the soldiers in South <lb/>
Africa. It was a light and very cheap and durable <lb/>
boot, which would remain dry in wet weather, and <lb/>
keep its shape and firmness. The inventor wanted <lb/>
to get the government's attention called to it, but he <lb/>
was an unknown man and knew the great officials <lb/>
would pay no heed to a message from him.</p>
<p>"This shows that he was an ass&#x2014;like the rest of <lb/>
us," I said, interrupting. "Go on."</p>
<p>"But why have you said that? The man spoke <lb/>
the truth."</p>
<p>"The man spoke a lie. Go on."</p>
<p>"I will <i>prove</i> that he&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="187"/>
<p>"You can't prove anything of the kind. I am <lb/>
very old and very wise. You must not argue with <lb/>
me: it is irreverent and offensive. Go on."</p>
<p>"Very well. But you will presently see. I am <lb/>
not unknown, yet even <i>I</i> was not able to get the <lb/>
man's message to the Director-General of the Shoe- <lb/>
Leather Department."</p>
<p>"This is another lie. Pray go on."</p>
<p>"But I assure you on my honor that I failed."</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly. I knew <i>that</i>. You didn't need <lb/>
to tell me."</p>
<p>"Then where is the lie?"</p>
<p>"It is in your intimation that you were <i>not able</i> <lb/>
to get the Director-General's immediate attention to <lb/>
the man's message. It is a lie, because you <i>could</i> <lb/>
have gotten his immediate attention to it."</p>
<p>"I tell you I couldn't. In three months I <lb/>
haven't accomplished it."</p>
<p>"Certainly. Of course. I could know that with- <lb/>
out your telling me. You <i>could</i> have gotten his im- <lb/>
mediate attention if you had gone at it in a sane <lb/>
way; and so could the other man."</p>
<p>"I <i>did</i> go at it in a sane way."</p>
<p>"You didn't."</p>
<p>"How do <i>you</i> know? What do you know about <lb/>
the circumstances?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all. But you didn't go at it in a <lb/>
sane way. That much I know to a certainty."</p>
<p>"How can you know it, when you don't know <lb/>
what method I used?"</p>
<pb n="188"/>
<p>"I know by the result. The result is perfect <lb/>
proof. You went at it in an insane way. I am <lb/>
very old and very w&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know. But will you let me tell you <lb/>
<i>how</i> I proceeded? I think that will settle whether <lb/>
it was insanity or not."</p>
<p>"No; that has already been settled. But go on, <lb/>
since you so desire to expose yourself. I am <lb/>
very o&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Certainly, certainly. I sat down and wrote a <lb/>
courteous letter to the Director-General of the Shoe- <lb/>
Leather Department, explai&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Do you know him personally?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You have scored one for my side. You began <lb/>
insanely. Go on."</p>
<p>"In the letter I made the great value and inex- <lb/>
pensiveness of the invention clear, and offered to&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Call and see him? Of course you did. Score <lb/>
two against yourself. I am v&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"He didn't answer for three days."</p>
<p>"Necessarily. Proceed."</p>
<p>"Sent me three gruff lines thanking me for my <lb/>
trouble, and proposing&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"That's it&#x2014;proposing nothing. Then I wrote <lb/>
him more elaborately and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Score three&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"&#x2014;and got no answer. At the end of a week I <lb/>
wrote and asked, with some touch of asperity, for <lb/>
an answer to that letter."</p>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>"Four. Go on."</p>
<p>"An answer came back saying the letter had not <lb/>
been received, and asking for a copy. I traced the <lb/>
letter through the post-office, and found that it <i>had</i> <lb/>
been received; but I sent a copy and said nothing. <lb/>
Two weeks passed without further notice of me. In <lb/>
the mean time I gradually got myself cooled down to <lb/>
a polite-letter temperature. Then I wrote and pro- <lb/>
posed an interview for next day, and said that if I <lb/>
did not hear from him in the mean time I should take <lb/>
his silence for assent."</p>
<p>"Score five."</p>
<p>"I arrived at twelve sharp, and was given a chair <lb/>
in the anteroom and told to wait. I waited until <lb/>
half-past one; then I left, ashamed and angry. I <lb/>
waited another week, to cool down; then I wrote <lb/>
and made another appointment with him for next <lb/>
day noon."</p>
<p>"Score six."</p>
<p>"He answered, assenting. I arrived promptly, <lb/>
and kept a chair warm until half-past two. I left <lb/>
then, and shook the dust of that place from my <lb/>
shoes for good and all. For rudeness, inefficiency, <lb/>
incapacity, indifference to the army's interests, the <lb/>
Director-General of the Shoe-Leather Department <lb/>
of the War Office is, in my o&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Peace! I am very old and very wise, and have <lb/>
seen many seemingly intelligent people who hadn't <lb/>
common sense enough to go at a simple and easy <lb/>
thing like this in a common-sense way. You are <lb/>
<pb n="190"/>
not a curiosity to me; I have personally known <lb/>
millions and billions like you. You have lost three <lb/>
months quite unnecessarily; the inventor has lost <lb/>
three months; the soldiers have lost three&#x2014;nine <lb/>
months altogether. I will now read you a little <lb/>
tale which I wrote last night. Then you will call on <lb/>
the Director-General at noon to-morrow and transact <lb/>
your business."</p>
<p>"Splendid! Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"No; but listen to the tale."</p>

<head><smcap>second story: how the chimney-sweep got the <lb/>
ear of the emperor</smcap></head>
<div4 type="subsection" n="I">
<head>I</head>
<p>Summer was come, and all the strong were bowed <lb/>
by the burden of the awful heat, and many of the <lb/>
weak were prostrate and dying. For weeks the <lb/>
army had been wasting away with a plague of <lb/>
dysentery, that scourge of the soldier, and there <lb/>
was but little help. The doctors were in despair; <lb/>
such efficacy as their drugs and their science had <lb/>
once had&#x2014;and it was not much at its best&#x2014;was a <lb/>
thing of the past, and promised to remain so.</p>
<p>The Emperor commanded the physicians of great- <lb/>
est renown to appear before him for a consultation, <lb/>
for he was profoundly disturbed. He was very <lb/>
severe with them, and called them to account for <lb/>
letting his soldiers die: and asked them if they knew <lb/>
their trade, or didn't; and were they properly heal- <lb/>
ers, or merely assassins? Then the principal assassin, <lb/>
<pb n="191"/>
who was also the oldest doctor in the land and the <lb/>
most venerable in appearance, answered and said:</p>
<p>"We have done what we could, your Majesty, <lb/>
and for a good reason it has been little. No medi- <lb/>
cine and no physician can cure that disease; only <lb/>
nature and a good constitution can do it. I am old, <lb/>
and I know. No doctor and no medicine can cure <lb/>
it&#x2014;I repeat it and I emphasize it. Sometimes they <lb/>
seem to help nature a little,&#x2014;a very little,&#x2014;but as <lb/>
a rule, they merely do damage."</p>
<p>The Emperor was a profane and passionate man, <lb/>
and he deluged the doctors with rugged and un- <lb/>
familiar names, and drove them from his presence.</p>
<p>Within a day he was attacked by that fell disease <lb/>
himself. The news flew from mouth to mouth, <lb/>
and carried consternation with it over all the land.</p>
<p>All the talk was about this awful disaster, and <lb/>
there was general depression, for few had hope. <lb/>
The Emperor himself was very melancholy, and <lb/>
sighed and said:</p>
<p>"The will of God be done. Send for the assas- <lb/>
sins again, and let us get over with it."</p>
<p>They came, and felt his pulse and looked at his <lb/>
tongue, and fetched the drug store and emptied it <lb/>
into him, and sat down patiently to wait&#x2014;for they <lb/>
were not paid by the job, but by the year.</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="subsection" n="II">
<head>II</head>
<p>Tommy was sixteen and a bright lad, but he was <lb/>
not in society. His rank was too humble for that, <lb/>
<pb n="192"/>
and his employment too base. In fact, it was the <lb/>
lowest of all employments, for he was second in <lb/>
command to his father, who emptied cesspools and <lb/>
drove a night-cart. Tommy's closest friend was <lb/>
Jimmy the chimney-sweep, a slim little fellow of <lb/>
fourteen, who was honest and industrious, and had a <lb/>
good heart, and supported a bedridden mother by <lb/>
his dangerous and unpleasant trade.</p>
<p>About a month after the Emperor fell ill, these <lb/>
two lads met one evening about nine. Tommy was <lb/>
on his way to his night-work, and of course was not <lb/>
in his Sundays, but in his dreadful work-clothes, and <lb/>
not smelling very well. Jimmy was on his way <lb/>
home from his day's labor, and was blacker than <lb/>
any other object imaginable, and he had his brushes <lb/>
on his shoulder and his soot-bag at his waist, and no <lb/>
feature of his sable face was distinguishable except <lb/>
his lively eyes.</p>
<p>They sat down on the curbstone to talk; and of <lb/>
course it was upon the one subject&#x2014;the nation's <lb/>
calamity, the Emperor's disorder. Jimmy was full of <lb/>
a great project, and burning to unfold it. He said:</p>
<p>"Tommy, I can cure his Majesty. I know how <lb/>
to do it."</p>
<p>Tommy was surprised.</p>
<p>"What! You?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I."</p>
<p>"Why, you little fool, the best doctors can't."</p>
<p>"I don't care: I can do it. I can cure him in <lb/>
fifteen minutes."</p>
<pb n="193"/>
<p>"Oh, come off! What are you giving me?"</p>
<p>"The facts&#x2014;that's all."</p>
<p>Jimmy's manner was so serious that it sobered <lb/>
Tommy, who said:</p>
<p>"I believe you are in earnest, Jimmy. Are you <lb/>
in earnest?"</p>
<p>"I give you my word."</p>
<p>"What is the plan? How'll you cure him?"</p>
<p>"Tell him to eat a slice of ripe watermelon."</p>
<p>It caught Tommy rather suddenly, and he was <lb/>
shouting with laughter at the absurdity of the idea <lb/>
before he could put on a stopper. But he sobered <lb/>
down when he saw that Jimmy was wounded. He <lb/>
patted Jimmy's knee affectionately, not minding the <lb/>
soot, and said:</p>
<p>"I take the laugh all back. I didn't mean any <lb/>
harm, Jimmy, and I won't do it again. You see, it <lb/>
seemed so funny, because wherever there's a soldier- <lb/>
camp and dysentery, the doctors always put up a <lb/>
sign saying anybody caught bringing watermelons <lb/>
there will be flogged with the cat till he can't stand."</p>
<p>"I know it&#x2014;the idiots!" said Jimmy, with both <lb/>
tears and anger in his voice. "There's plenty of <lb/>
watermelons, and not one of all those soldiers ought <lb/>
to have died."</p>
<p>"But, Jimmy, what put the notion into your head?"</p>
<p>"It isn't a notion; it's a fact. Do you know <lb/>
that old gray-headed Zulu? Well, this long time <lb/>
back he has been curing a lot of our friends, and <lb/>
my mother has seen him do it, and so have I. It <lb/>
<pb n="194"/>
takes only one or two slices of melon, and it don't <lb/>
make any difference whether the disease is new or <lb/>
old; it cures it."</p>
<p>"It's very odd. But, Jimmy, if it is so, the <lb/>
Emperor ought to be told of it."</p>
<p>"Of course; and my mother has told people, <lb/>
hoping they could get the word to him; but they <lb/>
are poor working-folks and ignorant, and don't <lb/>
know how to manage it."</p>
<p>"Of course they don't, the blunderheads," said <lb/>
Tommy, scornfully. "<i>I'll</i> get it to him!"</p>
<p>"You? You night-cart polecat!" And it was <lb/>
Jimmy's turn to laugh. But Tommy retorted <lb/>
sturdily:</p>
<p>"Oh, laugh if you like; but I'll <i>do</i> it!"</p>
<p>It had such an assured and confident sound that it <lb/>
made an impression, and Jimmy asked gravely:</p>
<p>"Do you know the Emperor?"</p>
<p>"Do <i>I</i> know him? Why, how you talk! Of <lb/>
course I don't."</p>
<p>"Then how'll you do it?"</p>
<p>"It's very simple and very easy. Guess. How <lb/>
would <i>you</i> do it, Jimmy?"</p>
<p>"Send him a letter. I never thought of it till <lb/>
this minute. But I'll bet that's your way."</p>
<p>"I'll bet it ain't. Tell me, how would you <lb/>
send it?"</p>
<p>"Why, through the mail, of course."</p>
<p>Tommy overwhelmed him with scoffings, and said:</p>
<p>"Now, don't you suppose every crank in the <lb/>
<pb n="195"/>
empire is doing the same thing? Do you mean to <lb/>
say you haven't thought of that?"</p>
<p>"Well&#x2014;no," said Jimmy, abashed.</p>
<p>"You <i>might</i> have thought of it, if you weren't so <lb/>
young and inexperienced. Why, Jimmy, when even <lb/>
a common <i>general</i>, or a poet, or an actor, or any- <lb/>
body that's a little famous gets sick, all the cranks <lb/>
in the kingdom load up the mails with certain-sure <lb/>
quack cures for him. And so, what's bound to <lb/>
happen when it's the Emperor?"</p>
<p>"I suppose it's worse," said Jimmy, sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Well, I should think so! Look here, Jimmy: <lb/>
every single night we cart off as many as six loads <lb/>
of that kind of letters from the back yard of the <lb/>
palace, where they're thrown. Eighty thousand <lb/>
letters in one night! Do you reckon anybody <lb/>
reads them? Sho! not a single one. It's what <lb/>
would happen to your letter if you wrote it&#x2014;which <lb/>
you won't, I reckon?"</p>
<p>"No," sighed Jimmy, crushed.</p>
<p>"But it's all right, Jimmy. Don't you fret: <lb/>
there's more than one way to skin a cat. <i>I'll</i> get <lb/>
the word to him."</p>
<p>"Oh, if you only <i>could</i>, Tommy, I should love <lb/>
you forever!"</p>
<p>"I'll do it, I tell you. Don't you worry; you <lb/>
depend on me."</p>
<p>"Indeed I will, Tommy, for you do know so <lb/>
much. You're not like other boys: they never <lb/>
know anything. How'll you manage, Tommy?"</p>
<pb n="196"/>
<p>Tommy was greatly pleased. He settled himself <lb/>
for reposeful talk, and said:</p>
<p>"Do you know that ragged poor thing that thinks <lb/>
he's a butcher because he goes around with a basket <lb/>
and sells cat's meat and rotten livers? Well, to <lb/>
begin with, I'll tell <i>him</i>."</p>
<p>Jimmy was deeply disappointed and chagrined, <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"Now, Tommy, it's a shame to talk so. You <lb/>
know my heart's in it, and it's not right."</p>
<p>Tommy gave him a love-pat, and said:</p>
<p>"Don't you be troubled, Jimmy. <i>I</i> know what <lb/>
I'm about. Pretty soon you'll see. That half- <lb/>
breed butcher will tell the old woman that sells <lb/>
chestnuts at the corner of the lane&#x2014;she's his closest <lb/>
friend, and I'll ask him to; then, by request, she'll <lb/>
tell her rich aunt that keeps the little fruit-shop on <lb/>
the corner two blocks above; and that one will tell <lb/>
her particular friend, the man that keeps the game- <lb/>
shop; and he will tell his friend the sergeant of <lb/>
police; and the sergeant will tell his captain, and the <lb/>
captain will tell the magistrate, and the magistrate <lb/>
will tell his brother-in-law the county judge, and <lb/>
the county judge will tell the sheriff, and the sheriff <lb/>
will tell the Lord Mayor, and the Lord Mayor will <lb/>
tell the President of the Council, and the President <lb/>
of the Council will tell the&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"By George, but it's a wonderful scheme, <lb/>
Tommy! How ever <i>did</i> you&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"&#x2014;Rear-Admiral, and the Rear will tell the Vice, <lb/>
<pb n="197"/>
and the Vice will tell the Admiral of the Blue, and <lb/>
the Blue will tell the Red, and the Red will tell the <lb/>
White, and the White will tell the First Lord of the <lb/>
Admiralty, and the First Lord will tell the Speaker <lb/>
of the House, and the Speaker&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Go it, Tommy; you're 'most there!"</p>
<p>"&#x2014;will tell the Master of the Hounds, and the <lb/>
Master will tell the Head Groom of the Stables, and <lb/>
the Head Groom will tell the Chief Equerry, and <lb/>
the Chief Equerry will tell the First Lord in Waiting, <lb/>
and the First Lord will tell the Lord High Chamber- <lb/>
lain, and the Lord High Chamberlain will tell the <lb/>
Master of the Household, and the Master of the <lb/>
Household will tell the little pet page that fans the <lb/>
flies off the Emperor, and the page will get down on <lb/>
his knees and whisper it to his Majesty&#x2014;and the <lb/>
game's made!"</p>
<p>"I've <i>got</i> to get up and hurrah a couple of times, <lb/>
Tommy. It's the grandest idea that ever was. <lb/>
What ever put it into your head?"</p>
<p>"Sit down and listen, and I'll give you some <lb/>
wisdom&#x2014;and don't you ever forget it as long as <lb/>
you live. Now, then, who is the closest friend <lb/>
you've got, and the one you couldn't and wouldn't <lb/>
ever refuse anything in the world to?"</p>
<p>"Why, it's you, Tommy. You know that."</p>
<p>"Suppose you wanted to ask a pretty large favor <lb/>
of the cat's-meat man. Well, you don't know him, <lb/>
and he would tell you to go to thunder, for he is that <lb/>
kind of a person; but he is my next best friend after <lb/>
<pb n="198"/>
you, and would run his legs off to do me a kindness <lb/>
&#x2014;<i>any</i> kindness, he don't care what it is. Now, I'll <lb/>
ask you: which is the most common-sensible&#x2014;for <lb/>
you to go and ask him to tell the chestnut-woman <lb/>
about your watermelon cure, or for you to get me <lb/>
to do it for you?"</p>
<p>"To get you to do it for me, of course. I <lb/>
wouldn't ever have thought of that, Tommy; it's <lb/>
splendid!"</p>
<p>"It's a <i>philosophy</i>, you see. Mighty good word&#x2014; <lb/>
and large. It goes on this idea: everybody in the <lb/>
world, little and big, has one <i>special</i> friend, a friend <lb/>
that he's <i>glad</i> to do favors to&#x2014;not sour about it, <lb/>
but <i>glad</i>&#x2014;glad clear to the marrow. And so, I <lb/>
don't care where you start, you can get at anybody's <lb/>
ear that you want to&#x2014;I don't care how low you are, <lb/>
nor how high he is. And it's so simple: you've <lb/>
only to find the <i>first</i> friend, that is all; that ends <lb/>
your part of the work. He finds the next friend <lb/>
himself, and that one finds the third, and so on, <lb/>
friend after friend, link after link, like a chain; and <lb/>
you can go up it or down it, as high as you like or <lb/>
as low as you like."</p>
<p>"It's just beautiful, Tommy."</p>
<p>"It's as simple and easy as a-b-c; but did you <lb/>
ever hear of anybody trying it? No; everybody is <lb/>
a fool. He goes to a stranger without any intro- <lb/>
duction, or writes him a letter, and of course he <lb/>
strikes a cold wave&#x2014;and serves him gorgeously <lb/>
right. Now, the Emperor don't know me, but</p>
<pb/>
<pb/>
<p><i>Jimmy saves the Emperor</i></p>
<pb/>
<figure/>
<pb/>
<pb n="199"/>
<p>that's no matter&#x2014;he'll eat his watermelon to-mor- <lb/>
row. You'll see. Hi-hi&#x2014;stop! It's the cat's- <lb/>
meat man. Good-by, Jimmy; I'll overtake him."</p>
<p>He did overtake him, and said:</p>
<p>"Say, will you do me a favor?"</p>
<p>"<i>Will</i> I? Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'm your man. <lb/>
Name it, and see me fly!"</p>
<p>"Go tell the chestnut-woman to put down every- <lb/>
thing and carry this message to her first-best friend, <lb/>
and tell the friend to pass it along." He worded the <lb/>
message, and said, "Now, then, rush!"</p>
<p>The next moment the chimney-sweep's word to <lb/>
the Emperor was on its way.</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="subsection" n="III">
<head>III</head>
<p>The next evening, toward midnight, the doctors <lb/>
sat whispering together in the imperial sick-room, <lb/>
and they were in deep trouble, for the Emperor was <lb/>
in very bad case. They could not hide it from them- <lb/>
selves that every time they emptied a fresh drug- <lb/>
store into him he got worse. It saddened them, for <lb/>
they were expecting that result. The poor emaci- <lb/>
ated Emperor lay motionless, with his eyes closed, <lb/>
and the page that was his darling was fanning the <lb/>
flies away and crying softly. Presently the boy heard <lb/>
the silken rustle of a porti&#x00E8;re, and turned and saw the <lb/>
Lord High Great Master of the Household peering in <lb/>
at the door and excitedly motioning to him to come. <lb/>
Lightly and swiftly the page tiptoed his way to his <lb/>
dear and worshiped friend the Master, who said:</p>
<pb n="200"/>
<p>"Only you can persuade him, my child, and oh, <lb/>
don't fail to do it! Take this, make him eat it, and <lb/>
he is saved."</p>
<p>"On my head be it. He shall eat it!"</p>
<p>It was a couple of great slices of ruddy, fresh <lb/>
watermelon.</p>
<p>The next morning the news flew everywhere that <lb/>
the Emperor was sound and well again, and had <lb/>
hanged the doctors. A wave of joy swept the land, <lb/>
and frantic preparations were made to illuminate.</p>
<p>After breakfast his Majesty sat meditating. His <lb/>
gratitude was unspeakable, and he was trying to de- <lb/>
vise a reward rich enough to properly testify it to his <lb/>
benefactor. He got it arranged in his mind, and <lb/>
called the page, and asked him if he had invented <lb/>
that cure. The boy said no&#x2014;he got it from the <lb/>
Master of the Household.</p>
<p>He was sent away, and the Emperor went to de- <lb/>
vising again. The Master was an earl; he would <lb/>
make him a duke, and give him a vast estate which <lb/>
belonged to a member of the Opposition. He had <lb/>
him called, and asked him if he was the inventor of <lb/>
the remedy. But the Master was an honest man, <lb/>
and said he got it of the Grand Chamberlain. He <lb/>
was sent away, and the Emperor thought some <lb/>
more. The Chamberlain was a viscount; he would <lb/>
make him an earl, and give him a large income. <lb/>
But the Chamberlain referred him to the First Lord <lb/>
in Waiting, and there was some more thinking; his <lb/>
Majesty thought out a smaller reward. But the <lb/>
<pb n="201"/>
First Lord in Waiting referred him back further, and <lb/>
he had to sit down and think out a further and <lb/>
becomingly and suitably smaller reward.</p>
<p>Then, to break the tediousness of the inquiry and <lb/>
hurry the business, he sent for the Grand High <lb/>
Chief Detective, and commanded him to trace the <lb/>
cure to the bottom, so that he could properly reward <lb/>
his benefactor.</p>
<p>At nine in the evening the High Chief Detective <lb/>
brought the word. He had traced the cure down <lb/>
to a lad named Jimmy, a chimney-sweep. The <lb/>
Emperor said, with deep feeling:</p>
<p>"Brave boy, he saved my life, and shall not re- <lb/>
gret it!"</p>
<p>And sent him a pair of his own boots; and the <lb/>
next best ones he had, too. They were too large <lb/>
for Jimmy, but they fitted the Zulu, so it was all <lb/>
right, and everything as it should be.</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="subsection">
<head><smcap>conclusion to the first story</smcap></head>
<p>"There&#x2014;do you get the idea?"</p>
<p>"I am obliged to admit that I do. And it will be <lb/>
as you have said. I will transact the business to- <lb/>
morrow. I intimately know the Director-General's <lb/>
nearest friend. He will give me a note of introduc- <lb/>
tion, with a word to say my matter is of real im- <lb/>
portance to the government. I will take it along, <lb/>
without an appointment, and send it in, with my card, <lb/>
and I shan't have to wait so much as half a minute."</p>
<p>That turned out true to the letter, and the govern- <lb/>
ment adopted the boots.</p>

<head><b>ABOUT PLAY-ACTING</b></head>
<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head>I</head>
<p><smcap>I have</smcap> a project to suggest. But first I will write <lb/>
a chapter of introduction.</p>
<p>I have just been witnessing a remarkable play, here <lb/>
at the Burg Theatre in Vienna. I do not know of <lb/>
any play that much resembles it. In fact, it is such <lb/>
a departure from the common laws of the drama <lb/>
that the name "play" doesn't seem to fit it quite <lb/>
snugly. However, whatever else it may be, it is in <lb/>
any case a great and stately metaphysical poem, <lb/>
and deeply fascinating. "Deeply fascinating" is <lb/>
the right term, for the audience sat four hours and <lb/>
five minutes without thrice breaking into applause, <lb/>
except at the close of each act; sat rapt and silent <lb/>
&#x2014;fascinated. This piece is "The Master of Pal- <lb/>
myra." It is twenty years old; yet I doubt if you <lb/>
have ever heard of it. It is by Wilbrandt, and is <lb/>
his masterpiece and the work which is to make his <lb/>
name permanent in German literature. It has never <lb/>
been played anywhere except in Berlin and in the <lb/>
great Burg Theatre in Vienna. Yet whenever it is <lb/>
put on the stage it packs the house, and the free list <lb/>
<pb n="203"/>
is suspended. I know people who have seen it ten <lb/>
times; they know the most of it by heart; they do <lb/>
not tire of it; and they say they shall still be quite <lb/>
willing to go and sit under its spell whenever they <lb/>
get the opportunity.</p>
<p>There is a dash of metempsychosis in it&#x2014;and it <lb/>
is the strength of the piece. The play gave me the <lb/>
sense of the passage of a dimly connected procession <lb/>
of dream-pictures. The scene of it is Palmyra in <lb/>
Roman times. It covers a wide stretch of time&#x2014;I <lb/>
don't know how many years&#x2014;and in the course of <lb/>
it the chief actress is reincarnated several times: <lb/>
four times she is a more or less young woman, <lb/>
and once she is a lad. In the first act she is <i>Zo&#x00EB;</i>&#x2014; <lb/>
a Christian girl who has wandered across the desert <lb/>
from Damascus to try to Christianize the Zeus-wor- <lb/>
shiping pagans of Palmyra. In this character she <lb/>
is wholly spiritual, a religious enthusiast, a devotee <lb/>
who covets martyrdom&#x2014;and gets it.</p>
<p>After many years she appears in the second act as <lb/>
<i>Ph&#x0153;be</i>, a graceful and beautiful young light-o'-love <lb/>
from Rome, whose soul is all for the shows and <lb/>
luxuries and delights of this life&#x2014;a dainty and <lb/>
capricious featherhead, a creature of shower and <lb/>
sunshine, a spoiled child, but a charming one.</p>
<p>In the third act, after an interval of many years, <lb/>
she reappears as <i>Persida</i>, mother of a daughter in <lb/>
the fresh bloom of youth. She is now a sort of <lb/>
combination of her two earlier selves: in religious <lb/>
loyalty and subjection she is <i>Zo&#x00EB;;</i> in triviality of <lb/>
<pb n="204"/>
character and shallowness of judgment&#x2014;together <lb/>
with a touch of vanity in dress&#x2014;she is <i>Ph&#x0153;be</i>.</p>
<p>After a lapse of years she appears in the fourth <lb/>
act as <i>Nymphas</i>, a beautiful boy, in whose character <lb/>
the previous incarnations are engagingly mixed.</p>
<p>And after another stretch of years all these heredi- <lb/>
ties are joined in the <i>Zenobia</i> of the fifth act&#x2014;a <lb/>
person of gravity, dignity, sweetness, with a heart <lb/>
filled with compassion for all who suffer, and a hand <lb/>
prompt to put into practical form the heart's benig- <lb/>
nant impulses.</p>
<p>You will easily concede that the actress who pro- <lb/>
poses to discriminate nicely these five characters, <lb/>
and play them to the satisfaction of a cultivated and <lb/>
exacting audience, has her work cut out for her. <lb/>
Mme. Hohenfels has made these parts her peculiar <lb/>
property; and she is well able to meet all the require- <lb/>
ments. You perceive, now, where the chief part of <lb/>
the absorbing fascination of this piece lies; it is in <lb/>
watching this extraordinary artist melt these five <lb/>
characters into each other&#x2014;grow, shade by shade, <lb/>
out of one and into another through a stretch of <lb/>
four hours and five minutes.</p>
<p>There are a number of curious and interesting <lb/>
features in this piece. For instance, its hero, <lb/>
<i>Apelles</i>, young, handsome, vigorous, in the first <lb/>
act, remains so all through the long flight of years <lb/>
covered by the five acts. Other men, young in the <lb/>
first act, are touched with gray in the second, are <lb/>
old and racked with infirmities in the third; in the <lb/>
<pb n="205"/>
fourth, all but one are gone to their long home, and <lb/>
he is a blind and helpless hulk of ninety or a hundred <lb/>
years. It indicates that the stretch of time covered <lb/>
by the piece is seventy years or more. The scenery <lb/>
undergoes decay, too&#x2014;the decay of age, assisted <lb/>
and perfected by a conflagration. The fine new <lb/>
temples and palaces of the second act are by and by <lb/>
a wreck of crumbled walls and prostrate columns, <lb/>
mouldy, grass-grown, and desolate; but their former <lb/>
selves are still recognizable in their ruins. The aging <lb/>
men and the aging scenery together convey a pro- <lb/>
found illusion of that long lapse of time: they make <lb/>
you live it yourself! You leave the theatre with the <lb/>
weight of a century upon you.</p>
<p>Another strong effect: Death, in person, walks <lb/>
about the stage in every act. So far as I could <lb/>
make out, he was supposedly not visible to any ex- <lb/>
cepting two persons&#x2014;the one he came for and <lb/>
<i>Apelles</i>. He used various costumes: but there <lb/>
was always more black about them than any other <lb/>
tint; and so they were always sombre. Also they <lb/>
were always deeply impressive, and indeed awe- <lb/>
inspiring. The face was not subjected to changes, <lb/>
but remained the same, first and last&#x2014;a ghastly <lb/>
white. To me he was always welcome, he seemed <lb/>
so real&#x2014;the actual Death, not a play-acting artifi- <lb/>
ciality. He was of a solemn and stately carriage; <lb/>
he had a deep voice, and used it with a noble <lb/>
dignity. Wherever there was a turmoil of merry- <lb/>
making or fighting or feasting or chaffing or quarrel- <lb/>
<pb n="206"/>
ing, or a gilded pageant, or other manifestation of our <lb/>
trivial and fleeting life, into it drifted that black figure <lb/>
with the corpse-face, and looked its fateful look and <lb/>
passed on; leaving its victim shuddering and smitten. <lb/>
And always its coming made the fussy human pack <lb/>
seem infinitely pitiful and shabby and hardly worth <lb/>
the attention of either saving or damning.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the first act the young girl <i>Zo&#x00EB;</i> <lb/>
appears by some great rocks in the desert, and sits <lb/>
down, exhausted, to rest. Presently arrive a pauper <lb/>
couple, stricken with age and infirmities; and they <lb/>
begin to mumble and pray to the Spirit of Life, who <lb/>
is said to inhabit that spot. The Spirit of Life <lb/>
appears; also Death&#x2014;uninvited. They are (sup- <lb/>
posably) invisible. Death, tall, black-robed, corpse- <lb/>
faced, stands motionless and waits. The aged <lb/>
couple pray to the Spirit of Life for a means to <lb/>
prop up their existence and continue it. Their <lb/>
prayer fails. The Spirit of Life prophesies <i>Zo&#x00EB;'s</i> <lb/>
martyrdom: it will take place before night. Soon <lb/>
<i>Apelles</i> arrives, young and vigorous and full of <lb/>
enthusiasm; he has led a host against the Persians <lb/>
and won the battle; he is the pet of fortune, <lb/>
rich, honored, beloved, "Master of Palmyra." He <lb/>
has heard that whoever stretches himself out on one of <lb/>
those rocks there, and asks for a deathless life, can <lb/>
have his wish. He laughs at the tradition, but wants <lb/>
to make the trial anyway. The invisible Spirit of Life <lb/>
warns him: "Life without end can be regret with- <lb/>
out end." But he persists: let him keep his youth, <lb/>
<pb n="207"/>
his strength, and his mental faculties unimpaired, <lb/>
and he will take all the risks. He has his desire.</p>
<p>From this time forth, act after act, the troubles <lb/>
and sorrows and misfortunes and humiliations of life <lb/>
beat upon him without pity or respite; but he will <lb/>
not give up, he will not confess his mistake. When- <lb/>
ever he meets Death he still furiously defies him&#x2014; <lb/>
but Death patiently waits. He, the healer of sor- <lb/>
rows, is man's best friend: the recognition of this <lb/>
will come. As the years drag on, and on, and on, <lb/>
the friends of the <i>Master's</i> youth grow old; and one <lb/>
by one they totter to the grave: he goes on with his <lb/>
proud fight, and will not yield. At length he is <lb/>
wholly alone in the world; all his friends are dead; <lb/>
last of all, his darling of darlings, his son, the lad <lb/>
<i>Nymphas</i>, who dies in his arms. His pride is broken <lb/>
now; and he would welcome Death, if Death would <lb/>
come, if Death would hear his prayers and give him <lb/>
peace. The closing act is fine and pathetic. <lb/>
<i>Apelles</i> meets <i>Zenobia</i>, the helper of all who <lb/>
suffer, and tells her his story, which moves her pity. <lb/>
By common report she is endowed with more than <lb/>
earthly powers; and, since he cannot have the boon <lb/>
of death, he appeals to her to drown his memory in <lb/>
forgetfulness of his griefs&#x2014;forgetfulness, "which <lb/>
is death's equivalent." She says (roughly trans- <lb/>
lated), in an exaltation of compassion: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Come to me!</l>
<l>Kneel; and may the power be granted me</l>
<l>To cool the fires of this poor tortured brain,</l>
<l>And bring it peace and healing."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="208"/>
<p>He kneels. From her hand, which she lays upon <lb/>
his head, a mysterious influence steals through him; <lb/>
and he sinks into a dreamy tranquillity.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Oh, if I could but so drift</l>
<l>Through this soft twilight into the night of peace,</l>
<l>Never to wake again!</l>
<l>(<i>Raising his hand, as if in benediction</i>.)</l>
<l>O mother earth, farewell!</l>
<l>Gracious thou wert to me. Farewell!</l>
<l>Apelles goes to rest."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Death appears behind him and encloses the up- <lb/>
lifted hand in his. <i>Apelles</i> shudders, wearily and <lb/>
slowly turns, and recognizes his life-long adversary. <lb/>
He smiles and puts all his gratitude into one simple <lb/>
and touching sentence, "Ich danke dir," and dies.</p>
<p>Nothing, I think, could be more moving, more <lb/>
beautiful, than this close. This piece is just one <lb/>
long, soulful, sardonic laugh at human life. Its title <lb/>
might properly be "Is Life a Failure?" and leave <lb/>
the five acts to play with the answer. I am not at <lb/>
all sure that the author meant to laugh at life. I <lb/>
only notice that he has done it. Without putting <lb/>
into words any ungracious or discourteous things <lb/>
about life, the episodes in the piece seem to be say- <lb/>
ing all the time, inarticulately: "Note what a silly, <lb/>
poor thing human life is; how childish its ambitions, <lb/>
how ridiculous its pomps, how trivial its dignities, <lb/>
how cheap its heroisms, how capricious its course, <lb/>
how brief its flight, how stingy in happiness, how <lb/>
opulent in miseries, how few its prides, how multi- <lb/>
tudinous its humiliations, how comic its tragedies, <lb/>
<pb n="209"/>
how tragic its comedies, how wearisome and monot- <lb/>
onous its repetition of its stupid history through the <lb/>
ages, with never the introduction of a new detail, how <lb/>
hard it has tried, from the Creation down, to play <lb/>
itself upon its possessor as a boon, and has never <lb/>
proved its case in a single instance!"</p>
<p>Take note of some of the details of the piece. <lb/>
Each of the five acts contains an independent tragedy <lb/>
of its own. In each act somebody's edifice of hope, <lb/>
or of ambition, or of happiness, goes down in ruins. <lb/>
Even <i>Apelles'</i> perennial youth is only a long <lb/>
tragedy, and his life a failure. There are two mar- <lb/>
tyrdoms in the piece; and they are curiously and <lb/>
sarcastically contrasted. In the first act the pagans <lb/>
persecute <i>Zo&#x00EB;</i>, the Christian girl, and a pagan mob <lb/>
slaughters her. In the fourth act those same <lb/>
pagans&#x2014;now very old and zealous&#x2014;are become <lb/>
Christians, and they persecute the pagans: a mob <lb/>
of them slaughters the pagan youth, <i>Nymphas</i>, <lb/>
who is standing up for the old gods of his <lb/>
fathers. No remark is made about this picturesque <lb/>
failure of civilization; but there it stands, as an un- <lb/>
worded suggestion that civilization, even when <lb/>
Christianized, was not able wholly to subdue the <lb/>
natural man in that old day&#x2014;just as in our day, the <lb/>
spectacle of a shipwrecked French crew clubbing <lb/>
women and children who tried to climb into the life- <lb/>
boats suggests that civilization has not succeeded in <lb/>
entirely obliterating the natural man even yet. <lb/>
Common sailors! A year ago, in Paris, at a fire, <lb/>
<pb n="210"/>
the aristocracy of the same nation clubbed girls and <lb/>
women out of the way to save themselves. Civiliza- <lb/>
tion tested at top and bottom both, you see. And <lb/>
in still another panic of fright we have this same <lb/>
"tough" civilization saving its honor by condemn- <lb/>
ing an innocent man to multiform death, and hug- <lb/>
ging and whitewashing the guilty one.</p>
<p>In the second act a grand Roman official is not <lb/>
above trying to blast <i>Apelles'</i> reputation by falsely <lb/>
charging him with misappropriating public moneys. <lb/>
<i>Apelles</i>, who is too proud to endure even the sus- <lb/>
picion of irregularity, strips himself to naked pov- <lb/>
erty to square the unfair account; and <i>his</i> troubles <lb/>
begin: the blight which is to continue and spread <lb/>
strikes his life; for the frivolous, pretty creature <lb/>
whom he has brought from Rome has no taste for <lb/>
poverty, and agrees to elope with a more competent <lb/>
candidate. Her presence in the house has previ- <lb/>
ously brought down the pride and broken the heart <lb/>
of <i>Apelles'</i> poor old mother; and <i>her</i> life is a <lb/>
failure. Death comes for her, but is willing to trade <lb/>
her for the Roman girl; so the bargain is struck <lb/>
with <i>Apelles</i>, and the mother spared for the present.</p>
<p>No one's life escapes the blight. <i>Timoleus</i>, the <lb/>
gay satirist of the first two acts, who scoffed at the <lb/>
pious hypocrisies and money-grubbing ways of the <lb/>
great Roman lords, is grown old and fat and blear- <lb/>
eyed and racked with disease in the third, has lost <lb/>
his stately purities, and watered the acid of his wit. <lb/>
<i>His</i> life has suffered defeat. Unthinkingly he swears <lb/>
<pb n="211"/>
by Zeus&#x2014;from ancient habit&#x2014;and then quakes <lb/>
with fright; for a fellow-communicant is passing by. <lb/>
Reproached by a pagan friend of his youth for his <lb/>
apostasy, he confesses that principle, when unsup- <lb/>
ported by an assenting stomach, has to climb down. <lb/>
One must have bread; and "the bread is Christian <lb/>
now." Then the poor old wreck, once so proud of <lb/>
iron rectitude, hobbles away, coughing and barking.</p>
<p>In the same act <i>Apelles</i> gives his sweet young <lb/>
Christian daughter and her fine young pagan lover <lb/>
his consent and blessing, and makes them utterly <lb/>
happy&#x2014;for five minutes. Then the priest and the <lb/>
mob come, to tear them apart and put the girl in a <lb/>
nunnery; for marriage between the sects is forbid- <lb/>
den. <i>Apelles'</i> wife could dissolve the rule; and she <lb/>
wants to do it: but under priestly pressure she <lb/>
wavers; then, fearing that in providing happiness for <lb/>
her child she would be committing a sin dangerous <lb/>
to herself, she goes over to the opposition, throwing <lb/>
the casting vote for the nunnery. The blight has <lb/>
fallen upon the young couple; <i>their</i> life is a failure.</p>
<p>In the fourth act, <i>Longinus</i>, who made such a <lb/>
prosperous and enviable start in the first act, is left <lb/>
alone in the desert, sick, blind, helpless, incredibly <lb/>
old, to die: not a friend left in the world&#x2014;another <lb/>
ruined life. And in that act, also, <i>Apelles'</i> wor- <lb/>
shiped boy, <i>Nymphas</i>, done to death by the mob, <lb/>
breathes out his last sigh in his father's arms&#x2014;one <lb/>
more failure. In the fifth act, <i>Apelles</i> himself <lb/>
dies, and is glad to do it; he who so ignorantly <lb/>
rejoiced, only four acts before, over the splendid <lb/>
<pb n="212"/>
present of an earthly immortality&#x2014;the very worst <lb/>
failure of the lot!</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="II">
<head>II</head>
<p>Now I approach my project. Here is the theatre <lb/>
list for Saturday, May 7, 1898&#x2014;cut from the <lb/>
advertising columns of a New York paper:</p>
<figure/>
<pb n="213"/>
<p>Now I arrive at my project, and make my sug- <lb/>
gestion. From the look of this lightsome feast, I <lb/>
conclude that what you need is a tonic. Send for <lb/>
"The Master of Palmyra." You are trying to <lb/>
make yourself believe that life is a comedy, that its <lb/>
sole business is fun, that there is nothing serious in <lb/>
it. You are ignoring the skeleton in your closet. <lb/>
Send for "The Master of Palmyra." You are <lb/>
neglecting a valuable side of your life; presently it <lb/>
will be atrophied. You are eating too much mental <lb/>
sugar; you will bring on Bright's disease of the in- <lb/>
tellect. You need a tonic; you need it very much. <lb/>
Send for "The Master of Palmyra." You will not <lb/>
need to translate it: its story is as plain as a pro- <lb/>
cession of pictures.</p>
<p>I have made my suggestion. Now I wish to put <lb/>
an annex to it. And that is this: It is right and <lb/>
wholesome to have those light comedies and enter- <lb/>
taining shows; and I shouldn't wish to see them <lb/>
diminished. But none of us is <i>always</i> in the comedy <lb/>
spirit: we have our graver moods; they come to us <lb/>
all; the lightest of us cannot escape them. These <lb/>
moods have their appetites&#x2014;healthy and legitimate <lb/>
appetites&#x2014;and there ought to be some way of satis- <lb/>
fying them. It seems to me that New York ought <lb/>
to have one theatre devoted to tragedy. With her <lb/>
three millions of population, and seventy outside <lb/>
millions to draw upon, she can afford it, she can <lb/>
support it. America devotes more time, labor, <lb/>
money, and attention to distributing literary and <lb/>
<pb n="214"/>
musical culture among the general public than does <lb/>
any other nation, perhaps; yet here you find her <lb/>
neglecting what is possibly the most effective of all <lb/>
the breeders and nurses and disseminators of high <lb/>
literary taste and lofty emotion&#x2014;the tragic stage. <lb/>
To leave that powerful agency out is to haul the <lb/>
culture-wagon with a crippled team. Nowadays, <lb/>
when a mood comes which only Shakspeare can set <lb/>
to music, what must we do? Read Shakspeare our- <lb/>
selves! Isn't it pitiful? It is playing an organ solo <lb/>
on a jew's-harp. <i>We</i> can't read. None but the <lb/>
Booths can do it.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago Edwin Booth played "Hamlet" <lb/>
a hundred nights in New York. With three times <lb/>
the population, how often is "Hamlet" played now <lb/>
in a year? If Booth were back now in his prime, <lb/>
how often could he play it in New York? Some <lb/>
will say twenty-five nights. I will say three hun- <lb/>
dred, and say it with confidence. The tragedians <lb/>
are dead; but I think that the taste and intelligence <lb/>
which made their market are not.</p>
<p>What <i>has</i> come over us English-speaking people? <lb/>
During the first half of this century tragedies and <lb/>
great tragedians were as common with us as farce <lb/>
and comedy; and it was the same in England. Now <lb/>
we have not a tragedian, I believe; and London, <lb/>
with her fifty shows and theatres, has but three, I <lb/>
think. It is an astonishing thing, when you come <lb/>
to consider it. Vienna remains upon the ancient <lb/>
basis: there has been no change. She sticks to the <lb/>
<pb n="215"/>
former proportions: a number of rollicking come- <lb/>
dies, admirably played, every night; and also every <lb/>
night at the Burg Theatre&#x2014;that wonder of the <lb/>
world for grace and beauty and richness and splen- <lb/>
dor and costliness&#x2014;a majestic drama of depth and <lb/>
seriousness, or a standard old tragedy. It is only <lb/>
within the last dozen years that men have learned to <lb/>
do miracles on the stage in the way of grand and <lb/>
enchanting scenic effects; and it is at such a time as <lb/>
this that we have reduced our scenery mainly to <lb/>
different breeds of parlors and varying aspects of <lb/>
furniture and rugs. I think we must have a Burg in <lb/>
New York, and Burg scenery, and a great company <lb/>
like the Burg company. Then, with a tragedy-tonic <lb/>
once or twice a month, we shall enjoy the comedies <lb/>
all the better. Comedy keeps the heart sweet; but <lb/>
we all know that there is wholesome refreshment for <lb/>
both mind and heart in an occasional climb among <lb/>
the pomps of the intellectual snow-summits built by <lb/>
Shakspeare and those others. Do I seem to be <lb/>
preaching? It is out of my line: I only do it be- <lb/>
cause the rest of the clergy seem to be on vacation.</p>

<head><b>DIPLOMATIC PAY AND CLOTHES</b></head>
<p><smcap>Vienna</smcap>, <i>January 5</i>.&#x2014;I find in this morning's <lb/>
papers the statement that the Government of <lb/>
the United States has paid to the two members of <lb/>
the Peace Commission entitled to receive money for <lb/>
their services &#x0024;100,000 each for their six weeks' <lb/>
work in Paris.</p>
<p>I hope that this is true. I will allow myself the <lb/>
satisfaction of considering that it <i>is</i> true, and of <lb/>
treating it as a thing finished and settled.</p>
<p>It is a precedent; and ought to be a welcome one <lb/>
to our country. A precedent always has a chance <lb/>
to be valuable (as well as the other way); and its <lb/>
best chance to be valuable (or the other way) is <lb/>
when it takes such a striking form as to fix a whole <lb/>
nation's attention upon it. If it come justified out <lb/>
of the discussion which will follow, it will find a <lb/>
career ready and waiting for it.</p>
<p>We realize that the edifice of public justice is built <lb/>
of precedents, from the ground upward; but we do <lb/>
not always realize that all the other details of our <lb/>
civilization are likewise built of precedents. The <lb/>
changes also which they undergo are due to the in- <lb/>
<pb n="217"/>
trusion of new precedents, which hold their ground <lb/>
against opposition, and keep their place. A pre- <lb/>
cedent may die at birth, or it may live&#x2014;it is mainly <lb/>
a matter of luck. If it be imitated once, it has a <lb/>
chance; if twice a better chance; if three times it is <lb/>
reaching a point where account must be taken of it; <lb/>
if four, five, or six times, it has probably come to <lb/>
stay&#x2014;for a whole century, possibly. If a town <lb/>
start a new bow, or a new dance, or a new temper- <lb/>
ance project, or a new kind of hat, and can get the <lb/>
precedent adopted in the next town, the career of <lb/>
that precedent is begun; and it will be unsafe to bet <lb/>
as to where the end of its journey is going to be. It <lb/>
may not get this start at all, and may have no career; <lb/>
but if a crown prince introduce the precedent, it will <lb/>
attract vast attention, and its chances for a career <lb/>
are so great as to amount almost to a certainty.</p>
<p>For a long time we have been reaping damage <lb/>
from a couple of disastrous precedents. One is <lb/>
the precedent of shabby pay to public servants <lb/>
standing for the power and dignity of the Republic <lb/>
in foreign lands; the other is a precedent condemn- <lb/>
ing them to exhibit themselves officially in clothes <lb/>
which are not only without grace or dignity, but are <lb/>
a pretty loud and pious rebuke to the vain and <lb/>
frivolous costumes worn by the other officials. To <lb/>
our day an American ambassador's official costume <lb/>
remains under the reproach of these defects. At a <lb/>
public function in a European court all foreign rep- <lb/>
resentatives except ours wear clothes which in some <lb/>
<pb n="218"/>
way distinguish them from the unofficial throng, and <lb/>
mark them as standing for their <i>countries</i>. But our <lb/>
representative appears in a plain black swallow-tail, <lb/>
which stands for neither country nor people. It <lb/>
has no nationality. It is found in all countries; it <lb/>
is as international as a night-shirt. It has no par- <lb/>
ticular meaning: but our Government tries to give it <lb/>
one; it tries to make it stand for Republican Sim- <lb/>
plicity, modesty and unpretentiousness. Tries, and <lb/>
without doubt fails, for it is not conceivable that this <lb/>
loud ostentation of simplicity deceives any one. <lb/>
The statue that advertises its modesty with a fig- <lb/>
leaf really brings its modesty under suspicion. <lb/>
Worn officially, our nonconforming swallow-tail is a <lb/>
declaration of ungracious independence in the mat- <lb/>
ter of manners, and is uncourteous. It says to all <lb/>
around: "In Rome we do not choose to do as <lb/>
Rome does; we refuse to respect your tastes and <lb/>
your traditions; we make no sacrifices to any one's <lb/>
customs and prejudices; we yield no jot to the <lb/>
courtesies of life; we prefer our manners, and in- <lb/>
trude them here."</p>
<p>That is not the true American spirit, and those <lb/>
clothes misrepresent us. When a foreigner comes <lb/>
among us and trespasses against our customs and <lb/>
our code of manners, we are offended, and justly so: <lb/>
but our Government commands our ambassadors to <lb/>
wear abroad an official dress which is an offense <lb/>
against foreign manners and customs; and the dis- <lb/>
credit of it falls upon the nation.</p>
<pb n="219"/>
<p>We did not dress our public functionaries in un- <lb/>
distinguished raiment before Franklin's time; and <lb/>
the change would not have come if he had been an <lb/>
obscurity. But he was such a colossal figure in the <lb/>
world that whatever he did of an unusual nature <lb/>
attracted the world's attention, and became a pre- <lb/>
cedent. In the case of clothes, the next representa- <lb/>
tive after him, and the next, had to imitate it. After <lb/>
that, the thing was custom: and custom is a petri- <lb/>
faction; nothing but dynamite can dislodge it for a <lb/>
century. We imagine that our queer official cos- <lb/>
tumery was deliberately devised to symbolize our Re- <lb/>
publican Simplicity&#x2014;a quality which we have never <lb/>
possessed, and are too old to acquire now, if we had <lb/>
any use for it or any leaning toward it. But it is <lb/>
not so; there was nothing deliberate about it: it <lb/>
grew naturally and heedlessly out of the precedent <lb/>
set by Franklin.</p>
<p>If it had been an intentional thing, and based <lb/>
upon a principle, it would not have stopped where <lb/>
it did: we should have applied it further. Instead <lb/>
of clothing our admirals and generals, for courts- <lb/>
martial and other public functions, in superb dress <lb/>
uniforms blazing with color and gold, the Govern- <lb/>
ment would put them in swallow-tails and white <lb/>
cravats, and make them look like ambassadors and <lb/>
lackeys. If I am wrong in making Franklin the <lb/>
father of our curious official clothes, it is no matter <lb/>
&#x2014;he will be able to stand it.</p>
<p>It is my opinion&#x2014;and I make no charge for the <lb/>

suggestion&#x2014;that, whenever we appoint an ambas- <lb/>
sador or a minister, we ought to confer upon him the <lb/>
temporary rank of admiral or general, and allow <lb/>
him to wear the corresponding uniform at public <lb/>
functions in foreign countries. I would recommend <lb/>
this for the reason that it is not consonant with the <lb/>
dignity of the United States of America that her <lb/>
representative should appear upon occasions of state <lb/>
in a dress which makes him glaringly conspicuous; <lb/>
and that is what his present undertaker-outfit does <lb/>
when it appears, with its dismal smudge, in the <lb/>
midst of the butterfly splendors of a Continental <lb/>
court. It is a most trying position for a shy man, a <lb/>
modest man, a man accustomed to being like other <lb/>
people. He is the most striking figure present; <lb/>
there is no hiding from the multitudinous eyes. It <lb/>
would be funny, if it were not such a cruel spectacle, <lb/>
to see the hunted creature in his solemn sables <lb/>
scuffling around in that sea of vivid color, like a <lb/>
mislaid Presbyterian in perdition. We are all aware <lb/>
that our representative's dress should not compel too <lb/>
much attention; for anybody but an Indian chief <lb/>
knows that that is a vulgarity. I am saying these <lb/>
things in the interest of our national pride and <lb/>
dignity. Our representative is the flag. He is the <lb/>
Republic. He is the United States of America. <lb/>
And when these embodiments pass by, we do not <lb/>
want them scoffed at; we desire that people shall <lb/>
be obliged to concede that they are worthily clothed, <lb/>
and politely.</p>
<pb n="221"/>
<p>Our Government is oddly inconsistent in this mat- <lb/>
ter of official dress. When its representative is a <lb/>
civilian who has not been a soldier, it restricts him <lb/>
to the black swallow-tail and white tie; but if he is a <lb/>
civilian who has been a soldier, it allows him to <lb/>
wear the uniform of his former rank as an official <lb/>
dress. When General Sickles was minister to Spain, <lb/>
he always wore, when on official duty, the dress <lb/>
uniform of a major-general. When General Grant <lb/>
visited foreign courts, he went handsomely and <lb/>
properly ablaze in the uniform of a full general, and <lb/>
was introduced by diplomatic survivals of his own <lb/>
Presidential Administration. The latter, by official <lb/>
necessity, went in the meek and lowly swallow-tail <lb/>
&#x2014;a deliciously sarcastic contrast: the one dress <lb/>
representing the honest and honorable dignity of the <lb/>
nation; the other, the cheap hypocrisy of the Re- <lb/>
publican Simplicity tradition. In Paris our present <lb/>
representative can perform his official functions rep- <lb/>
utably clothed; for he was an officer in the Civil <lb/>
War. In London our late ambassador was similarly <lb/>
situated; for he also was an officer in the Civil <lb/>
War. But Mr. Choate must represent the Great <lb/>
Republic&#x2014;even at official breakfast at seven in the <lb/>
morning&#x2014;in that same old funny swallow-tail.</p>
<p>Our Government's notions about proprieties of <lb/>
costume are indeed very, very odd&#x2014;as suggested <lb/>
by that last fact. The swallow-tail is recognized the <lb/>
world over as not wearable in the daytime; it is a <lb/>
night-dress, and a night-dress only&#x2014;a night-shirt is <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
not more so. Yet, when our representative makes <lb/>
an official visit in the morning, he is obliged by his <lb/>
Government to go in that night-dress. It makes the <lb/>
very cab-horses laugh.</p>
<p>The truth is, that for a while during the present <lb/>
century, and up to something short of forty years <lb/>
ago, we had a lucid interval, and dropped the <lb/>
Republican Simplicity sham, and dressed our foreign <lb/>
representatives in a handsome and becoming official <lb/>
costume. This was discarded by and by, and the <lb/>
swallow-tail substituted. I believe it is not now <lb/>
known which statesman brought about this change; <lb/>
but we all know that, stupid as he was as to diplo- <lb/>
matic proprieties in dress, he would not have sent his <lb/>
daughter to a state ball in a corn-shucking costume, <lb/>
nor to a corn-shucking in a state ball costume, to be <lb/>
harshly criticised as an ill-mannered offender against <lb/>
the proprieties of custom in both places. And we <lb/>
know another thing, viz.: that he himself would not <lb/>
have wounded the tastes and feelings of a family of <lb/>
mourners by attending a funeral in their house in a <lb/>
costume which was an offense against the dignities <lb/>
and decorum prescribed by tradition and sanctified <lb/>
by custom. Yet that man was so heedless as not to <lb/>
reflect that <i>all</i> the social customs of civilized peoples <lb/>
are entitled to respectful observance, and that no <lb/>
man with a right spirit of courtesy in him ever has <lb/>
any disposition to transgress these customs.</p>
<p>There is still another argument for a rational <lb/>
diplomatic dress&#x2014;a business argument. We are a <lb/>
<pb n="223"/>
trading nation; and our representative is our busi- <lb/>
ness agent. If he is respected, esteemed, and liked <lb/>
where he is stationed, he can exercise an influence <lb/>
which can extend our trade and forward our pros- <lb/>
perity. A considerable number of his business <lb/>
activities have their field in his social relations; and <lb/>
clothes which do not offend against local manners <lb/>
and customs and prejudices are a valuable part of his <lb/>
equipment in this matter&#x2014;would be, if Franklin had <lb/>
died earlier.</p>
<p>I have not done with gratis suggestions yet. We <lb/>
made a great and valuable advance when we insti- <lb/>
tuted the office of ambassador. That lofty rank <lb/>
endows its possessor with several times as much in- <lb/>
fluence, consideration, and effectiveness as the rank <lb/>
of minister bestows. For the sake of the country's <lb/>
dignity and for the sake of her advantage commer- <lb/>
cially, we should have ambassadors, not ministers, at <lb/>
the great courts of the world.</p>
<p>But not at present salaries! No; if we are to <lb/>
maintain present salaries, let us make no more am- <lb/>
bassadors; and let us unmake those we have already <lb/>
made. The great position, without the means of re- <lb/>
spectably maintaining it&#x2014;there could be no wisdom <lb/>
in that. A foreign representative, to be valuable to <lb/>
his country, must be on good terms with the officials <lb/>
of the capital and with the rest of the influential folk. <lb/>
He must mingle with this society; he cannot sit at <lb/>
home&#x2014;it is not business, it butters no commercial <lb/>
parsnips. He must attend the dinners, banquets, <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
suppers, balls, receptions, and must <i>return</i> these <lb/>
hospitalities. He should return as good as he gets, <lb/>
too, for the sake of the dignity of his country, and <lb/>
for the sake of Business. Have we ever had a min- <lb/>
ister or an ambassador who could do this on his <lb/>
salary? No&#x2014;not once, from Franklin's time to <lb/>
ours. Other countries understand the commercial <lb/>
value of properly lining the pockets of their repre- <lb/>
sentatives; but apparently our Government has not <lb/>
learned it. England is the most successful trader of <lb/>
the several trading nations; and she takes good care <lb/>
of the watchmen who keep guard in her commercial <lb/>
towers. It has been a long time, now, since we <lb/>
needed to blush for our representatives abroad. It <lb/>
has become custom to send our fittest. We send <lb/>
men of distinction, cultivation, character&#x2014;our <lb/>
ablest, our choicest, our best. Then we cripple <lb/>
their efficiency through the meagreness of their pay. <lb/>

<p>Sir Julian Pauncefote, the English ambassador at <lb/>
Washington, has a very fine house besides&#x2014;at no <lb/>
damage to his salary.</p>
<p>English ambassadors pay no house-rent; they live <lb/>
in palaces owned by England. Our representatives <lb/>
pay house-rent out of their salaries. You can judge <lb/>
by the above figures what kind of houses the United <lb/>
States of America has been used to living in abroad, <lb/>
and what sort of return-entertaining she has done. <lb/>
There is not a salary in our list which would properly <lb/>
house the representative receiving it, and, in addi- <lb/>
tion, pay &#x0024;3,000 toward his family's bacon and <lb/>
doughnuts&#x2014;the strange but economical and custom- <lb/>
ary fare of the American ambassador's household, <lb/>
except on Sundays, when petrified Boston crackers <lb/>
are added.</p>
<p>The ambassadors and ministers of foreign nations <lb/>
not only have generous salaries, but their Govern- <lb/>
ments provide them with money wherewith to pay a <lb/>
considerable part of their hospitality bills. I believe <lb/>
our Government pays no hospitality bills except those <lb/>
incurred by the navy. Through this concession to <lb/>
the navy, that arm is able to do us credit in foreign <lb/>
parts; and certainly that is well and politic. But <lb/>
why the Government does not think it well and poli- <lb/>
tic that our diplomats should be able to do us like <lb/>
credit abroad is one of those mysterious inconsist- <lb/>
encies which have been puzzling me ever since I <lb/>
stopped trying to understand baseball and took up <lb/>
statesmanship as a pastime.</p>
<pb n="226"/>
<p>To return to the matter of house-rent. Good <lb/>
houses, properly furnished, in European capitals, are <lb/>
not to be had at small figures. Consequently, our <lb/>
foreign representatives have been accustomed to live <lb/>
in garrets&#x2014;sometimes on the roof. Being poor <lb/>
men, it has been the best they could do on the salary <lb/>
which the Government has paid them. How could <lb/>
they adequately return the hospitalities shown them? <lb/>
It was impossible. It would have exhausted the <lb/>
salary in three months. Still, it was their official <lb/>
duty to entertain the influentials after some sort of <lb/>
fashion; and they did the best they could with their <lb/>
limited purse. In return for champagne they fur- <lb/>
nished lemonade; in return for game they furnished <lb/>
ham; in return for whale they furnished sardines; in <lb/>
return for liquors they furnished condensed milk; <lb/>
in return for the battalion of liveried and powdered <lb/>
flunkeys they furnished the hired girl; in return for <lb/>
the fairy wilderness of sumptuous decorations they <lb/>
draped the stove with the American flag; in return <lb/>
for the orchestra they furnished zither and ballads <lb/>
by the family; in return for the ball&#x2014;but they <lb/>
didn't return the ball, except in cases where the <lb/>
United States lived on the roof and had room.</p>
<p>Is this an exaggeration? It can hardly be called <lb/>
that. I saw nearly the equivalent of it once, a good <lb/>
many years ago. A minister was trying to create <lb/>
influential friends for a project which might be worth <lb/>
ten millions a year to the agriculturists of the Re- <lb/>
public; and our Government had furnished him ham <lb/>
<pb n="227"/>
and lemonade to persuade the opposition with. <lb/>
The minister did not succeed. He might not have <lb/>
succeeded if his salary had been what it ought to <lb/>
have been&#x2014;&#x0024;50,000 or &#x0024;60,000 a year&#x2014;but his <lb/>
chances would have been very greatly improved. <lb/>
And in any case, he and his dinners and his country <lb/>
would not have been joked about by the hard-hearted <lb/>
and pitied by the compassionate.</p>
<p>Any experienced "drummer" will testify that, <lb/>
when you want to do business, there is no economy <lb/>
in ham and lemonade. The drummer takes his <lb/>
country customer to the theatre, the opera, the <lb/>
circus; dines him, wines him, entertains him all the <lb/>
day and all the night in luxurious style; and plays <lb/>
upon his human nature in all seductive ways. For he <lb/>
knows, by old experience, that this is the best way <lb/>
to get a profitable order out of him. He has his <lb/>
reward. All Governments except our own play the <lb/>
same policy, with the same end in view; and they <lb/>
also have their reward. But ours refuses to do <lb/>
business by business ways, and sticks to ham and <lb/>
lemonade. This is the most expensive diet known <lb/>
to the diplomatic service of the world.</p>
<p>Ours is the only country of first importance that <lb/>
pays its foreign representatives trifling salaries. If <lb/>
we were poor, we could not find great fault with <lb/>
these economies, perhaps&#x2014;at least one could find a <lb/>
sort of plausible excuse for them. But we are not <lb/>
poor; and the excuse fails. As shown above, some <lb/>
of our important diplomatic representatives receive <lb/>
<pb n="228"/>
&#x0024;12,000; others &#x0024;17,500. These salaries are all ham <lb/>
and lemonade, and unworthy of the flag. When we <lb/>
have a rich ambassador in London or Paris, he lives <lb/>
as the ambassador of a country like ours ought to <lb/>
live, and it costs him &#x0024;100,000 a year to do it. But <lb/>
why should we allow him to pay that out of his <lb/>
private pocket? There is nothing fair about it; and <lb/>
the Republic is no proper subject for any one's <lb/>
charity. In several cases our salaries of &#x0024;12,000 <lb/>
should be &#x0024;50,000; and all of the salaries of &#x0024;17,- <lb/>
500 ought to be &#x0024;75,000 or &#x0024;100,000, since we pay <lb/>
no representative's house-rent. Our State Depart- <lb/>
ment realizes the mistake which we are making, and <lb/>
would like to rectify it, but it has not the power.</p>
<p>When a young girl reaches eighteen she is recog- <lb/>
nized as being a woman. She adds six inches to her <lb/>
skirt, she unplaits her dangling braids and balls her <lb/>
hair on top of her head, she stops sleeping with her <lb/>
little sister and has a room to herself, and becomes <lb/>
in many ways a thundering expense. But she is in <lb/>
society now; and papa has to stand it. There is no <lb/>
avoiding it. Very well. The Great Republic length- <lb/>
ened her skirts last year, balled up her hair, and <lb/>
entered the world's society. This means that, if <lb/>
she would prosper and stand fair with society, she <lb/>
must put aside some of her dearest and darlingest <lb/>
young ways and superstitions, and do as society <lb/>
does. Of course, she can decline if she wants to; <lb/>
but this would be unwise. She ought to realize, <lb/>
now that she has "come out," that this is a right <lb/>
<pb n="229"/>
and proper time to change a part of her style. She <lb/>
is in Rome; and it has long been granted that when <lb/>
one is in Rome it is good policy to do as Rome <lb/>
does. To advantage Rome? No&#x2014;to advantage <lb/>
herself.</p>
<p>If our Government has really paid representatives <lb/>
of ours on the Paris Commission &#x0024;100,000 apiece <lb/>
for six weeks' work, I feel sure that it is the best <lb/>
cash investment the nation has made in many years. <lb/>
For it seems quite impossible that, with that pre- <lb/>
cedent on the books, the Government will be able to <lb/>
find excuses for continuing its diplomatic salaries at <lb/>
the present mean figure.</p>
<p><i>P. S.</i>&#x2014;<smcap>Vienna</smcap>, <i>January 10</i>.&#x2014;I see, by this <lb/>
morning's telegraphic news, that I am not to be the <lb/>
new ambassador here, after all. This&#x2014;well, I <lb/>
hardly know what to say. I&#x2014;well, of course, I do <lb/>
not care anything about it; but it is at least a sur- <lb/>
prise. I have for many months been using my in- <lb/>
fluence at Washington to get this diplomatic see <lb/>
expanded into an ambassadorship, with the idea, of <lb/>
course, th&#x2014; But never mind. Let it go. It is of <lb/>
no consequence. I say it calmly; for I am calm. <lb/>
But at the same time&#x2014; However, the subject has <lb/>
no interest for me, and never had. I never really <lb/>
intended to take the place, anyway&#x2014;I made up my <lb/>
mind to it months and months ago, nearly a year. <lb/>
But now, while I am calm, I would like to say this&#x2014; <lb/>
that so long as I shall continue to possess an Ameri- <lb/>
can's proper pride in the honor and dignity of his <lb/>
<pb n="230"/>
country, I will not take any ambassadorship in the <lb/>
gift of the flag at a salary short of &#x0024;75,000 a year. <lb/>
If I shall be charged with wanting to live beyond my <lb/>
country's means, I cannot help it. A country which <lb/>
cannot afford ambassador's wages should be ashamed <lb/>
to have ambassadors.</p>
<p>Think of a Seventeen-thousand-five-hundred-dollar <lb/>
ambassador! Particularly for <i>America</i>. Why, it is <lb/>
the most ludicrous spectacle, the most inconsistent and <lb/>
incongruous spectacle, contrivable by even the most <lb/>
diseased imagination. It is a billionaire in a paper <lb/>
collar, a king in a breechclout, an archangel in a tin <lb/>
halo. And, for pure sham and hypocrisy, the salary <lb/>
is just the match of the ambassador's official clothes <lb/>
&#x2014;that boastful advertisement of a Republican Sim- <lb/>
plicity which manifests itself at home in Fifty-thou- <lb/>
sand-dollar salaries to insurance presidents and rail- <lb/>
way lawyers, and in domestic palaces whose fittings <lb/>
and furnishings often transcend in costly display and <lb/>
splendor and richness the fittings and furnishings of <lb/>
the palaces of the sceptred masters of Europe; and <lb/>
which has invented and exported to the Old World <lb/>
the palace-car, the sleeping-car, the tram-car, the <lb/>
electric trolley, the best bicycles, the best motor- <lb/>
cars, the steam-heater, the best and smartest systems <lb/>
of electric calls and telephonic aids to laziness and <lb/>
comfort, the elevator, the private bath-room (hot <lb/>
and cold water on tap), the palace-hotel, with its <lb/>
multifarious conveniences, comforts, shows, and <lb/>
luxuries, the&#x2014;oh, the list is interminable! In a <lb/>
<pb n="231"/>
word, Republican Simplicity found Europe with one <lb/>
shirt on her back, so to speak, as far as <i>real</i> luxuries, <lb/>
conveniences, and the comforts of life go, and has <lb/>
clothed her to the chin with the latter. We are the <lb/>
lavishest and showiest and most luxury-loving peo- <lb/>
ple on the earth; and at our masthead we fly one <lb/>
true and honest symbol, the gaudiest flag the world <lb/>
has ever seen. Oh, Republican Simplicity, there <lb/>
are many, many humbugs in the world, but none to <lb/>
which you need take off <i>your</i> hat!</p>

<head><b>IS HE LIVING OR IS HE DEAD</b></head>
<p><smcap>I was</smcap> spending the month of March, 1892, at <lb/>
Mentone, in the Riviera. At this retired spot <lb/>
one has all the advantages, privately, which are to <lb/>
be had at Monte Carlo and Nice, a few miles farther <lb/>
along, publicly. That is to say, one has the flood- <lb/>
ing sunshine, the balmy air, and the brilliant blue <lb/>
sea, without the marring additions of human pow- <lb/>
wow and fuss and feathers and display. Mentone is <lb/>
quiet, simple, restful, unpretentious; the rich and <lb/>
the gaudy do not come there. As a rule, I mean, <lb/>
the rich do not come there. Now and then a rich <lb/>
man comes, and I presently got acquainted with one <lb/>
of these. Partially to disguise him I will call him <lb/>
Smith. One day, in the H&#x00F4;tel des Anglais, at the <lb/>
second breakfast, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Quick! Cast your eye on the man going out <lb/>
at the door. Take in every detail of him."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Do you know who he is?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He spent several days here before you <lb/>
came. He is an old, retired, and very rich silk <lb/>
manufacturer from Lyons, they say, and I guess he <lb/>
<pb n="233"/>
is alone in the world, for he always looks sad and <lb/>
dreamy, and doesn't talk with anybody. His name <lb/>
is Th&#x00E9;ophile Magnan."</p>
<p>I supposed that Smith would now proceed to <lb/>
justify the large interest which he had shown in <lb/>
Monsieur Magnan; but instead he dropped into a <lb/>
brown study, and was apparently lost to me and to <lb/>
the rest of the world during some minutes. Now <lb/>
and then he passed his fingers through his flossy <lb/>
white hair, to assist his thinking, and meantime he <lb/>
allowed his breakfast to go on cooling. At last he <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"No, it's gone; I can't call it back."</p>
<p>"Can't call what back?"</p>
<p>"It's one of Hans Andersen's beautiful little <lb/>
stories. But it's gone from me. Part of it is like <lb/>
this: A child has a caged bird, which it loves, but <lb/>
thoughtlessly neglects. The bird pours out its song <lb/>
unheard and unheeded; but in time, hunger and <lb/>
thirst assail the creature, and its song grows plain- <lb/>
tive and feeble and finally ceases&#x2014;the bird dies. <lb/>
The child comes, and is smitten to the heart with <lb/>
remorse; then, with bitter tears and lamentations, <lb/>
it calls its mates, and they bury the bird with <lb/>
elaborate pomp and the tenderest grief, without <lb/>
knowing, poor things, that it isn't children only who <lb/>
starve poets to death and then spend enough on <lb/>
their funerals and monuments to have kept them <lb/>
alive and made them easy and comfortable. Now&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But here we were interrupted. About ten that <lb/>
<pb n="234"/>
evening I ran across Smith, and he asked me up to <lb/>
his parlor to help him smoke and drink hot Scotch. <lb/>
It was a cosy place, with its comfortable chairs, its <lb/>
cheerful lamps, and its friendly open fire of seasoned <lb/>
olive-wood. To make everything perfect, there was <lb/>
the muffled booming of the surf outside. After the <lb/>
second Scotch and much lazy and contented chat, <lb/>
Smith said:</p>
<p>"Now we are properly primed&#x2014;I to tell a <lb/>
curious history, and you to listen to it. It has been <lb/>
a secret for many years&#x2014;a secret between me and <lb/>
three others; but I am going to break the seal now. <lb/>
Are you comfortable?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly. Go on."</p>
<p>Here follows what he told me:</p>
<p>"A long time ago I was a young artist&#x2014;a very <lb/>
young artist, in fact&#x2014;and I wandered about the <lb/>
country parts of France, sketching here and sketch- <lb/>
ing there, and was presently joined by a couple of <lb/>
darling young Frenchmen who were at the same kind <lb/>
of thing that I was doing. We were as happy as we <lb/>
were poor, or as poor as we were happy&#x2014;phrase it <lb/>
to suit yourself. Claude Fr&#x00E8;re and Carl Boulanger <lb/>
&#x2014;these are the names of those boys; dear, dear <lb/>
fellows, and the sunniest spirits that ever laughed at <lb/>
poverty and had a noble good time in all weathers.</p>
<p>"At last we ran hard aground in a Breton village, <lb/>
and an artist as poor as ourselves took us in and <lb/>
literally saved us from starving&#x2014;Fran&#x00E7;ois Millet&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"What! the <i>great</i> Fran&#x00E7;ois Millet?"</p>
<pb n="235"/>
<p>"Great? He wasn't any greater than we were, <lb/>
then. He hadn't any fame, even in his own village; <lb/>
and he was so poor that he hadn't anything to feed <lb/>
us on but turnips, and even the turnips failed us <lb/>
sometimes. We four became fast friends, doting <lb/>
friends, inseparables. We painted away together <lb/>
with all our might, piling up stock, piling up stock, <lb/>
but very seldom getting rid of any of it. We had <lb/>
lovely times together; but, O my soul! how we <lb/>
were pinched now and then!</p>
<p>"For a little over two years this went on. At <lb/>
last, one day, Claude said:</p>
<p>"'Boys, we've come to the end. Do you under- <lb/>
stand that?&#x2014;absolutely to the end. Everybody <lb/>
has struck&#x2014;there's a league formed against us. <lb/>
I've been all around the village and it's just as I <lb/>
tell you. They refuse to credit us for another <lb/>
centime until all the odds and ends are paid up.'</p>
<p>"This struck us cold. Every face was blank <lb/>
with dismay. We realized that our circumstances <lb/>
were desperate, now. There was a long silence. <lb/>
Finally, Millet said with a sigh:</p>
<p>"'Nothing occurs to me&#x2014;nothing. Suggest <lb/>
something, lads.'</p>
<p>"There was no response, unless a mournful <lb/>
silence may be called a response. Carl got up, and <lb/>
walked nervously up and down awhile, then said:</p>
<p>"'It's a shame! Look at these canvases: stacks <lb/>
and stacks of as good pictures as anybody in <lb/>
Europe paints&#x2014;I don't care who he is. Yes, and <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
plenty of lounging strangers have said the same&#x2014; <lb/>
or nearly that, anyway.'</p>
<p>"'But didn't buy,' Millet said.</p>
<p>"'No matter, they said it; and it's true, too. <lb/>
Look at your "Angelus" there! Will anybody <lb/>
tell me&#x2014;'</p>
<p>"'Pah, Carl&#x2014;my "Angelus"! I was offered <lb/>
five francs for it.'</p>
<p>"'When?'</p>
<p>"'Who offered it?'</p>
<p>"'Where is he?'</p>
<p>"'Why didn't you take it?'</p>
<p>"'Come&#x2014;don't all speak at once. I thought <lb/>
he would give more&#x2014;I was sure of it&#x2014;he looked <lb/>
it&#x2014;so I asked him eight.'</p>
<p>"'Well&#x2014;and then?'</p>
<p>"'He said he would call again.'</p>
<p>"'Thunder and lightning! Why, Fran&#x00E7;ois&#x2014;'</p>
<p>"'Oh, I know&#x2014;I know! It was a mistake, and <lb/>
I was a fool. Boys, I meant for the best; you'll <lb/>
grant me that, and I&#x2014;'</p>
<p>"'Why, certainly, we know that, bless your dear <lb/>
heart; but don't you be a fool again.'</p>
<p>"'I? I wish somebody would come along and <lb/>
offer us a cabbage for it&#x2014;you'd see!'</p>
<p>"'A cabbage! Oh, don't name it&#x2014;it makes <lb/>
my mouth water. Talk of things less trying.'</p>
<p>"'Boys,' said Carl, '<i>do</i> these pictures lack <lb/>
merit? Answer me that.'</p>
<p>"'No!'</p>
<pb n="237"/>
<p>"'Aren't they of very great and high merit? <lb/>
Answer me that.'</p>
<p>"'Yes'</p>
<p>"'Of such great and high merit that, if an illus- <lb/>
trious name were attached to them, they would sell <lb/>
at splendid prices. Isn't it so?'</p>
<p>"'Certainly it is. Nobody doubts that.'</p>
<p>"'But&#x2014;I'm not joking&#x2014;<i>isn't</i> it so?'</p>
<p>"'Why, of course it's so&#x2014;and <i>we</i> are not jok- <lb/>
ing. But what of it? What of it? How does that <lb/>
concern us?'</p>
<p>"'In this way, comrades&#x2014;we'll <i>attach</i> an illus- <lb/>
trious name to them!'</p>
<p>"The lively conversation stopped. The faces <lb/>
were turned inquiringly upon Carl. What sort of <lb/>
riddle might this be? Where was an illustrious name <lb/>
to be borrowed? And who was to borrow it?</p>
<p>"Carl sat down, and said:</p>
<p>"'Now, I have a perfectly serious thing to pro- <lb/>
pose. I think it is the only way to keep us out of <lb/>
the almshouse, and I believe it to be a perfectly <lb/>
sure way. I base this opinion upon certain multi- <lb/>
tudinous and long-established facts in human history. <lb/>
I believe my project will make us all rich.'</p>
<p>"'Rich! You've lost your mind.'</p>
<p>"'No, I haven't.'</p>
<p>"'Yes, you have&#x2014;you've lost your mind. <lb/>
What do you <i>call</i> rich?'</p>
<p>"'A hundred thousand francs apiece.'</p>
<p>"'He <i>has</i> lost his mind. I knew it.'</p>
<pb n="238"/>
<p>"'Yes, he has. Carl, privation has been too <lb/>
much for you, and&#x2014;'</p>
<p>"'Carl, you want to take a pill and get right to <lb/>
bed.'</p>
<p>"'Bandage him first&#x2014;bandage his head, and <lb/>
then&#x2014;'</p>
<p>"'No, bandage his heels; his brains have been <lb/>
settling for weeks&#x2014;I've noticed it.'</p>
<p>"'Shut up!' said Millet, with ostensible severity, <lb/>
'and let the boy say his say. Now, then&#x2014;come <lb/>
out with your project, Carl. What is it?'</p>
<p>"'Well, then, by way of preamble I will ask you <lb/>
to note this fact in human history: that the merit <lb/>
of many a great artist has never been acknowledged <lb/>
until after he was starved and dead. This has hap- <lb/>
pened so often that I make bold to found a law upon <lb/>
it. This law: that the merit of <i>every</i> great unknown <lb/>
and neglected artist must and will be recognized, <lb/>
and his pictures climb to high prices after his death. <lb/>
My project is this: we must cast lots&#x2014;one of us <lb/>
must die.'</p>
<p>"The remark fell so calmly and so unexpectedly <lb/>
that we almost forgot to jump. Then there was a <lb/>
wild chorus of advice again&#x2014;medical advice&#x2014;for <lb/>
the help of Carl's brain; but he waited patiently for <lb/>
the hilarity to calm down, then went on again with <lb/>
his project:</p>
<p>"'Yes, one of us must die, to save the others&#x2014; <lb/>
and himself. We will cast lots. The one chosen <lb/>
shall be illustrious, all of us shall be rich. Hold <lb/>
<pb n="239"/>
still, now&#x2014;hold still; don't interrupt&#x2014;I tell you <lb/>
I know what I am talking about. Here is the idea. <lb/>
During the next three months the one who is to die <lb/>
shall paint with all his might, enlarge his stock all <lb/>
he can&#x2014;not pictures, <i>no!</i> skeleton sketches, <lb/>
studies, parts of studies, fragments of studies, a <lb/>
dozen dabs of the brush on each&#x2014;meaningless, of <lb/>
course, but <i>his</i> with his cipher on them; turn out <lb/>
fifty a day, each to contain some peculiarity or man- <lb/>
nerism easily detectable as his&#x2014;<i>they're</i> the things <lb/>
that sell, you know, and are collected at fabulous <lb/>
prices for the world's museums, after the great man <lb/>
is gone; we'll have a ton of them ready&#x2014;a ton! <lb/>
And all that time the rest of us will be busy support- <lb/>
ing the moribund, and working Paris and the dealers <lb/>
&#x2014;preparations for the coming event, you know; and <lb/>
when everything is hot and just right, we'll spring <lb/>
the death on them and have the notorious funeral. <lb/>
You get the idea?'</p>
<p>"'N-o; at least, not qu&#x2014;'</p>
<p>"'Not quite? Don't you see? The man doesn't <lb/>
really die; he changes his name and vanishes; we <lb/>
bury a dummy, and cry over it, with all the world to <lb/>
help. And I&#x2014;'</p>
<p>"But he wasn't allowed to finish. Everybody <lb/>
broke out into a rousing hurrah of applause; and all <lb/>
jumped up and capered about the room and fell on <lb/>
each other's necks in transports of gratitude and <lb/>
joy. For hours we talked over the great plan, with- <lb/>
out ever feeling hungry; and at last, when all the <lb/>
<pb n="240"/>
details had been arranged satisfactorily, we cast lots <lb/>
and Millet was elected&#x2014;elected to die, as we called <lb/>
it. Then we scraped together those things which <lb/>
one never parts with until he is betting them against <lb/>
future wealth&#x2014;keepsake trinkets and such like&#x2014; <lb/>
and these we pawned for enough to furnish us a <lb/>
frugal farewell supper and breakfast, and leave us a <lb/>
few francs over for travel, and a stake of turnips and <lb/>
such for Millet to live on for a few days.</p>
<p>"Next morning, early, the three of us cleared <lb/>
out, straightway after breakfast&#x2014;on foot, of course. <lb/>
Each of us carried a dozen of Millet's small pictures, <lb/>
purposing to market them. Carl struck for Paris, <lb/>
where he would start the work of building up Mil- <lb/>
let's fame against the coming great day. Claude <lb/>
and I were to separate, and scatter abroad over <lb/>
France.</p>
<p>"Now, it will surprise you to know what an easy <lb/>
and comfortable thing we had. I walked two days <lb/>
before I began business. Then I began to sketch a <lb/>
villa in the outskirts of a big town&#x2014;because I saw <lb/>
the proprietor standing on an upper veranda. He <lb/>
came down to look on&#x2014;I thought he would. I <lb/>
worked swiftly, intending to keep him interested. <lb/>
Occasionally he fired off a little ejaculation of appro- <lb/>
bation, and by and by he spoke up with enthusiasm, <lb/>
and said I was a master!</p>
<p>"I put down my brush, reached into my satchel, <lb/>
fetched out a Millet, and pointed to the cipher in <lb/>
the corner. I said, proudly:</p>
<pb n="241"/>
<p>"'I suppose you recognize <i>that?</i> Well, he <lb/>
taught me! I should <i>think</i> I ought to know my <lb/>
trade!'</p>
<p>"The man looked guiltily embarrassed, and was <lb/>
silent. I said, sorrowfully:</p>
<p>"'You don't mean to intimate that you don't <lb/>
know the cipher of Fran&#x00E7;ois Millet!'</p>
<p>"Of course he didn't know that cipher; but he <lb/>
was the gratefulest man you ever saw, just the same, <lb/>
for being let out of an uncomfortable place on such <lb/>
easy terms. He said:</p>
<p>"'No! Why, it <i>is</i> Millet's, sure enough! I <lb/>
don't know what I could have been thinking of. <lb/>
Of course I recognize it now.'</p>
<p>"Next, he wanted to buy it; but I said that <lb/>
although I wasn't rich I wasn't <i>that</i> poor. How- <lb/>
ever, at last, I let him have it for eight hundred <lb/>
francs."</p>
<p>"Eight hundred!"</p>
<p>"Yes. Millet would have sold it for a pork chop. <lb/>
Yes, I got eight hundred francs for that little thing. <lb/>
I wish I could get it back for eighty thousand. <lb/>
But that time's gone by. I made a very nice picture <lb/>
of that man's house, and I wanted to offer it to him <lb/>
for ten francs, but that wouldn't answer, seeing I <lb/>
was the pupil of such a master, so I sold it to him <lb/>
for a hundred. I sent the eight hundred francs <lb/>
straight back to Millet from that town and struck out <lb/>
again next day.</p>
<p>"But I didn't walk&#x2014;no. I rode. I have ridden <lb/>
<pb n="242"/>
ever since. I sold one picture every day, and never <lb/>
tried to sell two. I always said to my customer:</p>
<p>"'I am a fool to sell a picture of Fran&#x00E7;ois Mil- <lb/>
let's at all, for that man is not going to live three <lb/>
months, and when he dies his pictures can't be had <lb/>
for love or money.'</p>
<p>"I took care to spread that little fact as far as I <lb/>
could, and prepare the world for the event.</p>
<p>"I take credit to myself for our plan of selling <lb/>
the pictures&#x2014;it was mine. I suggested it that last <lb/>
evening when we were laying out our campaign, and <lb/>
all three of us agreed to give it a good fair trial be- <lb/>
fore giving it up for some other. It succeeded with <lb/>
all of us. I walked only two days, Claude walked <lb/>
two&#x2014;both of us afraid to make Millet celebrated <lb/>
too close to home&#x2014;but Carl walked only half a <lb/>
day, the bright, conscienceless rascal, and after that <lb/>
he traveled like a duke.</p>
<p>"Every now and then we got in with a country <lb/>
editor and started an item around through the press; <lb/>
not an item announcing that a new painter had been <lb/>
discovered, but an item which let on that everybody <lb/>
knew Fran&#x00E7;ois Millet; not an item praising him in <lb/>
any way, but merely a word concerning the present <lb/>
condition of the 'master'&#x2014;sometimes hopeful, <lb/>
sometimes despondent, but always tinged with fears <lb/>
for the worst. We always marked these paragraphs, <lb/>
and sent the papers to all the people who had <lb/>
bought pictures of us.</p>
<p>"Carl was soon in Paris, and he worked things <lb/>
<pb n="243"/>
with a high hand. He made friends with the cor- <lb/>
respondents, and got Millet's condition reported to <lb/>
England and all over the continent, and America, <lb/>
and everywhere.</p>
<p>"At the end of six weeks from the start, we three <lb/>
met in Paris and called a halt, and stopped sending <lb/>
back to Millet for additional pictures. The boom <lb/>
was so high, and everything so ripe, that we saw <lb/>
that it would be a mistake not to strike now, right <lb/>
away, without waiting any longer. So we wrote <lb/>
Millet to go to bed and begin to waste away pretty <lb/>
fast, for we should like him to die in ten days if he <lb/>
could get ready.</p>
<p>"Then we figured up and found that among us we <lb/>
had sold eighty-five small pictures and studies, and <lb/>
had sixty-nine thousand francs to show for it. Carl <lb/>
had made the last sale and the most brilliant one of <lb/>
all. He sold the 'Angelus' for twenty-two hundred <lb/>
francs. How we did glorify him!&#x2014;not foreseeing <lb/>
that a day was coming by and by when France would <lb/>
struggle to own it and a stranger would capture it <lb/>
for five hundred and fifty thousand, cash.</p>
<p>"We had a wind-up champagne supper that <lb/>
night, and next day Claude and I packed up and <lb/>
went off to nurse Millet through his last days and <lb/>
keep busybodies out of the house and send daily <lb/>
bulletins to Carl in Paris for publication in the <lb/>
papers of several continents for the information of a <lb/>
waiting world. The sad end came at last, and Carl <lb/>
was there in time to help in the final mournful rites.</p>
<pb n="244"/>
<p>"You remember that great funeral, and what a <lb/>
stir it made all over the globe, and how the illus- <lb/>
trious of two worlds came to attend it and testify <lb/>
their sorrow. We four&#x2014;still inseparable&#x2014;carried <lb/>
the coffin, and would allow none to help. And we <lb/>
were right about that, because it hadn't anything in <lb/>
it but a wax figure, and any other coffin-bearers <lb/>
would have found fault with the weight. Yes, we <lb/>
same old four, who had lovingly shared privation <lb/>
together in the old hard times now gone forever, <lb/>
carried the cof&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Which four?"</p>
<p>"<i>We</i> four&#x2014;for Millet helped to carry his own <lb/>
coffin. In disguise, you know. Disguised as a <lb/>
relative&#x2014;distant relative."</p>
<p>"Astonishing!"</p>
<p>"But true, just the same. Well, you remember <lb/>
how the pictures went up. Money? We didn't <lb/>
know what to do with it. There's a man in Paris <lb/>
to-day who owns seventy Millet pictures. He paid <lb/>
us two million francs for them. And as for the <lb/>
bushels of sketches and studies which Millet shoveled <lb/>
out during the six weeks that we were on the road, <lb/>
well, it would astonish you to know the figure we <lb/>
sell them at nowadays&#x2014;that is, when we consent <lb/>
to let one go!"</p>
<p>"It is a wonderful history, perfectly wonderful!"</p>
<p>"Yes&#x2014;it amounts to that."</p>
<p>"Whatever became of Millet?"</p>
<p>"Can you keep a secret?"</p>
<pb n="245"/>
<p>"I can."</p>
<p>"Do you remember the man I called your atten- <lb/>
tion to in the dining-room to-day? <i>That was <lb/>
Fran&#x00E7;ois Millet</i>."</p>
<p>"Great&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Scott! Yes. For once they didn't starve a <lb/>
genius to death and then put into other pockets the <lb/>
rewards he should have had himself. <i>This</i> song- <lb/>
bird was not allowed to pipe out its heart unheard <lb/>
and then be paid with the cold pomp of a big <lb/>
funeral. We looked out for that."</p>

<head><b>MY BOYHOOD DREAMS</b></head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> dreams of my boyhood? No, they have not <lb/>
been realized. For all who are old, there is <lb/>
something infinitely pathetic about the subject which <lb/>
you have chosen, for in no gray-head's case can it <lb/>
suggest any but one thing&#x2014;disappointment. Dis- <lb/>
appointment is its own reason for its pain: the <lb/>
quality or dignity of the hope that failed is a matter <lb/>
aside. The dreamer's valuation of a thing lost&#x2014; <lb/>
not another man's&#x2014;is the only standard to measure <lb/>
it by, and his grief for it makes it large and great <lb/>
and fine, and is worthy of our reverence in all cases. <lb/>
We should carefully remember that. There are six- <lb/>
teen hundred million people in the world. Of these <lb/>
there is but a trifling number&#x2014;in fact, only thirty- <lb/>
eight million&#x2014;who can understand why a person <lb/>
should have an ambition to belong to the French <lb/>
army; and why, belonging to it, he should be proud <lb/>
of that; and why, having got down that far, he <lb/>
should want to go on down, down, down till he <lb/>
struck bottom and got on the General Staff; and <lb/>
why, being stripped of his livery, or set free and <lb/>
reinvested with his self-respect by any other quick <lb/>
<pb n="247"/>
and thorough process, let it be what it might, he <lb/>
should wish to return to his strange serfage. But <lb/>
no matter: the estimate put upon these things by <lb/>
the fifteen hundred and sixty millions is no proper <lb/>
measure of their value: the proper measure, the <lb/>
just measure, is that which is put upon them by <lb/>
Dreyfus, and is cipherable merely upon the littleness <lb/>
or the vastness of the <i>disappointment</i> which their <lb/>
loss cost him.</p>
<p>There you have it: the measure of the magnitude <lb/>
of a dream-failure is the measure of the disappoint- <lb/>
ment the failure cost the dreamer; the value, in <lb/>
others' eyes, of the thing lost, has nothing to do <lb/>
with the matter. With this straightening-out and <lb/>
classification of the dreamer's position to help us, <lb/>
perhaps we can put ourselves in his place and re- <lb/>
spect his dream&#x2014;Dreyfus's, and the dreams our <lb/>
friends have cherished and reveal to us. Some that <lb/>
I call to mind, some that have been revealed to me, <lb/>
are curious enough; but we may not smile at them, <lb/>
for they were precious to the dreamers, and their <lb/>
failure has left scars which give them dignity and <lb/>
pathos. With this theme in my mind, dear heads that <lb/>
were brown when they and mine were young together <lb/>
rise old and white before me now, beseeching me to <lb/>
speak for them, and most lovingly will I do it.</p>
<p>Howells, Hay, Aldrich, Matthews, Stockton, <lb/>
Cable, Remus&#x2014;how their young hopes and am- <lb/>
bitions come flooding back to my memory now, out <lb/>
of the vague far past, the beautiful past, the <lb/>
<pb n="248"/>
lamented past! I remember it so well&#x2014;that night <lb/>
we met together&#x2014;it was in Boston, and Mr. Fields <lb/>
was there, and Mr. Osgood, and Ralph Keeler, and <lb/>
Boyle O'Reilly, lost to us now these many years&#x2014; <lb/>
and under the seal of confidence revealed to each <lb/>
other what our boyhood dreams had been: dreams <lb/>
which had not as yet been blighted, but over which <lb/>
was stealing the gray of the night that was to come <lb/>
&#x2014;a night which we prophetically <i>felt</i>, and this feel- <lb/>
ing oppressed us and made us sad. I remember that <lb/>
Howells's voice broke twice, and it was only with <lb/>
great difficulty that he was able to go on; in the end <lb/>
he wept. For he had hoped to be an auctioneer. <lb/>
He told of his early struggles to climb to his <lb/>
goal, and how at last he attained to within a single <lb/>
step of the coveted summit. But there misfortune <lb/>
after misfortune assailed him, and he went down, <lb/>
and down, and down, until now at last, weary and <lb/>
disheartened, he had for the present given up the <lb/>
struggle and become editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. <lb/>
This was in 1830. Seventy years are gone since, <lb/>
and where now is his dream? It will never be ful- <lb/>
filled. And it is best so; he is no longer fitted for <lb/>
the position; no one would take him now; even if <lb/>
he got it, he would not be able to do himself credit <lb/>
in it, on account of his deliberateness of speech and <lb/>
lack of trained professional vivacity; he would be <lb/>
put on real estate, and would have the pain of seeing <lb/>
younger and abler men intrusted with the furniture <lb/>
and other such goods&#x2014;goods which draw a mixed <lb/>
<pb n="249"/>
and intellectually low order of customers, who must <lb/>
be beguiled of their bids by a vulgar and specialized <lb/>
humor and sparkle, accompanied with antics.</p>
<p>But it is not the thing lost that counts, but only the <lb/>
<i>disappointment</i> the loss brings to the dreamer that <lb/>
had coveted that thing and had set his heart of <lb/>
hearts upon it; and when we remember this, a great <lb/>
wave of sorrow for Howells rises in our breasts, and <lb/>
we wish for his sake that his fate could have been <lb/>
different.</p>
<p>At that time Hay's boyhood dream was not yet <lb/>
past hope of realization, but it was fading, dimming, <lb/>
wasting away, and the wind of a growing apprehen- <lb/>
sion was blowing cold over the perishing summer of <lb/>
his life. In the pride of his young ambition he had <lb/>
aspired to be a steamboat mate; and in fancy <lb/>
saw himself dominating a forecastle some day on the <lb/>
Mississippi and dictating terms to roustabouts in <lb/>
high and wounding tones. I look back now, from <lb/>
this far distance of seventy years, and note with sor- <lb/>
row the stages of that dream's destruction. Hay's <lb/>
history is but Howells's, with differences of detail. <lb/>
Hay climbed high toward his ideal; when success <lb/>
seemed almost sure, his foot upon the very gang- <lb/>
plank, his eye upon the capstan, misfortune came <lb/>
and his fall began. Down&#x2014;down&#x2014;down&#x2014;ever <lb/>
down: Private Secretary to the President; Colonel <lb/>
in the field; Charg&#x00E9; d'Affaires in Paris; Charg&#x00E9; <lb/>
d'Affaires in Vienna; Poet; Editor of the <foreign lang="fre"><i>Tribune</i>;</foreign> <lb/>
Biographer of Lincoln; Ambassador to England; <lb/>
<pb n="250"/>
and now at last there he lies&#x2014;Secretary of State, <lb/>
Head of Foreign Affairs. And he has fallen like <lb/>
Lucifer, never to rise again. And his dream&#x2014; <lb/>
where now is his dream? Gone down in blood and <lb/>
tears with the dream of the auctioneer.</p>
<p>And the young dream of Aldrich&#x2014;where is that? <lb/>
I remember yet how he sat there that night fondling <lb/>
it, petting it; seeing it recede and ever recede; try- <lb/>
ing to be reconciled and give it up, but not able yet <lb/>
to bear the thought; for it had been his hope to be <lb/>
a horse-doctor. He also climbed high, but, like the <lb/>
others, fell; then fell again, and yet again, and <lb/>
again and again. And now at last he can fall no <lb/>
further. He is old now, he has ceased to struggle, <lb/>
and is only a poet. No one would risk a horse with <lb/>
him now. His dream is over.</p>
<p>Has <i>any</i> boyhood dream ever been fulfilled? I <lb/>
must doubt it. Look at Brander Matthews. He <lb/>
wanted to be a cowboy. What is he to-day? <lb/>
Nothing but a professor in a university. Will he <lb/>
ever be a cowboy? It is hardly conceivable.</p>
<p>Look at Stockton. What was Stockton's young <lb/>
dream? He hoped to be a barkeeper. See where <lb/>
<i>he</i> has landed.</p>
<p>Is it better with Cable? What was Cable's young <lb/>
dream? To be ring-master in the circus, and swell <lb/>
around and crack the whip. What is he to-day? <lb/>
Nothing but a theologian and novelist.</p>
<p>And Uncle Remus&#x2014;what was his young dream? <lb/>
To be a buccaneer. Look at him now.</p>
<pb n="251"/>
<p>Ah, the dreams of our youth, how beautiful they <lb/>
are, and how perishable! The ruins of these might- <lb/>
have-beens, how pathetic! The heart-secrets that <lb/>
were revealed that night now so long vanished, how <lb/>
they touch me as I give them voice! Those sweet <lb/>
privacies, how they endeared us to each other! <lb/>
We were under oath never to tell any of these <lb/>
things, and I have always kept that oath inviolate <lb/>
when speaking with persons whom I thought not <lb/>
worthy to hear them.</p>
<p>Oh, our lost Youth&#x2014;God keep its memory green <lb/>
in our hearts! for Age is upon us, with the in- <lb/>
dignity of its infirmities, and Death beckons!</p>

<q>Fearing that there might be some mistake, we submitted a proof of <lb/>

to correct any errors of detail that might have crept in among the facts. <lb/>
They reply with some asperity that errors cannot creep in among facts <lb/>
where there are no facts for them to creep in among; and that none are <lb/>
discoverable in this article, but only baseless aberrations of a disordered <lb/>
mind. They have no recollection of any such night in Boston, nor else- <lb/>
where; and in their opinion there was never any such night. They <lb/>
have <i>met</i> Mr. Twain, but have had the prudence not to intrust any <lb/>
privacies to him&#x2014;particularly under oath; and they think they now see <lb/>
that this prudence was justified, since he has been untrustworthy enough <lb/>
to even betray privacies which had no existence. Further they think <lb/>
it a strange thing that Mr. Twain, who was never invited to meddle with <lb/>
anybody's boyhood dreams but his own, has been so gratuitously anxious <lb/>
to see that other people's are placed before the world that he has quite <lb/>
lost his head in his zeal and forgotten to make any mention of his own at <lb/>
all. Provided we insert this explanation, they are willing to let his article <lb/>
pass; otherwise they must require its suppression in the interest of truth.</q>
<q><i>P. S.</i>&#x2014;These replies having left us in some perplexity, and also in <lb/>
some fear lest they might distress Mr. Twain if published without his <lb/>

opportunity to defend himself. But he does not seem to be troubled, or <lb/>
even aware that he is in a delicate situation. He merely says:</q>

<head><b>THE AUSTRIAN EDISON KEEPING <lb/>
SCHOOL AGAIN</b></head>
<p><smcap>By</smcap> a paragraph in the <i>Freie Presse</i> it appears that <lb/>
Jan Szczepanik, the youthful inventor of the <lb/>
"telelectroscope" (for seeing at great distances) <lb/>
and some other scientific marvels, has been having <lb/>
an odd adventure, by help of the state.</p>
<p>Vienna is hospitably ready to smile whenever there <lb/>
is an opportunity, and this seems to be a fair one. <lb/>
Three or four years ago, when Szczepanik was <lb/>
nineteen or twenty years old, he was a schoolmaster <lb/>
in a Moravian village, on a salary of&#x2014;I forget the <lb/>
amount, but no matter; there was not enough of it <lb/>
to remember. His head was full of inventions, and <lb/>
in his odd hours he began to plan them out. He <lb/>
soon perfected an ingenious invention for applying <lb/>
photography to pattern-designing as used in the <lb/>
textile industries, whereby he proposed to reduce <lb/>
the customary outlay of time, labor, and money <lb/>
expended on that department of loom-work to next <lb/>
to nothing. He wanted to carry his project to <lb/>
Vienna and market it; and as he could not get leave <lb/>
of absence, he made his trip without leave. This <lb/>
<pb n="256"/>
lost him his place, but did not gain him his market. <lb/>
When his money ran out he went back home, and <lb/>
was presently reinstated. By and by he deserted <lb/>
once more, and went to Vienna, and this time he <lb/>
made some friends who assisted him, and his inven- <lb/>
tion was sold to England and Germany for a great <lb/>
sum. During the past three years he has been ex- <lb/>
perimenting and investigating in velvety comfort. <lb/>
His most picturesque achievement is his telelectro- <lb/>
scope, a device which a number of able men&#x2014;in- <lb/>
cluding Mr. Edison, I think&#x2014;had already tried their <lb/>
hands at, with prospects of eventual success. A <lb/>
Frenchman came near to solving the difficult and in- <lb/>
tricate problem fifteen years ago, but an essential <lb/>
detail was lacking which he could not master, and he <lb/>
suffered defeat. Szczepanik's experiments with his <lb/>
pattern-designing project revealed to him the secret <lb/>
of the lacking detail. He perfected his invention, <lb/>
and a French syndicate has bought it, and saved it <lb/>
for exhibition and fortune-making at the Paris <lb/>
world's fair.</p>
<p>As a schoolmaster Szczepanik was exempt from <lb/>
military duty. When he ceased from teaching, be- <lb/>
ing an educated man he could have had himself en- <lb/>
rolled as a one-year volunteer; but he forgot to do <lb/>
it, and this exposed him to the privilege, and also <lb/>
the necessity, of serving <i>three</i> years in the army. <lb/>
In the course of duty, the other day, an official dis- <lb/>
covered the inventor's indebtedness to the state, and <lb/>
took the proper measures to collect. At first there <lb/>
<pb n="257"/>
seemed to be no way for the inventor (and the <lb/>
state) out of the difficulty. The authorities were <lb/>
loath to take the young man out of his great labora- <lb/>
tory, where he was helping to shove the whole <lb/>
human race along on its road to new prosperities and <lb/>
scientific conquests, and suspend operations in his <lb/>
mental Klondike three years, while he punched the <lb/>
empty air with a bayonet in a time of peace; but <lb/>
there was the law, and how was it to be helped? It <lb/>
was a difficult puzzle, but the authorities labored at <lb/>
it until they found a forgotten law somewhere which <lb/>
furnished a loop-hole&#x2014;a large one, and a long one, <lb/>
too, as it looks to me. By this piece of good luck <lb/>
Szczepanik is saved from soldiering, but he becomes <lb/>
a schoolmaster again; and it is a sufficiently pictur- <lb/>
esque billet, when you examine it. He must go back <lb/>
to his village every two months, and teach his school <lb/>
half a day&#x2014;from early in the morning until noon; <lb/>
and, to the best of my understanding of the pub- <lb/>
lished terms, he must keep this up the rest of his <lb/>
life! I hope so, just for the romantic poeticalness <lb/>
of it. He is twenty-four, strongly and compactly <lb/>
built, and comes of an ancestry accustomed to wait- <lb/>
ing to see its great-grandchildren married. It is <lb/>
almost certain that he will live to be ninety. I hope <lb/>
so. This promises him sixty-six years of useful <lb/>
school service. Dissected, it gives him a chance to <lb/>
teach school 396 half-days, make 396 railway trips <lb/>
going and 396 back, pay bed and board 396 times <lb/>
in the village, and lose possibly 1,200 days from his <lb/>
<pb n="258"/>
laboratory work&#x2014;that is to say, three years and <lb/>
three months or so. And he already owes three <lb/>
years to this same account. This has been over- <lb/>
looked; I shall call the attention of the authorities <lb/>
to it. It may be possible for him to get a compro- <lb/>
mise on this compromise by doing his three years in <lb/>
the army, and saving one; but I think it can't hap- <lb/>
pen. This government "holds the age" on him; <lb/>
it has what is technically called a "good thing" in <lb/>
financial circles, and knows a good thing when it <lb/>
sees it. I know the inventor very well, and he has <lb/>
my sympathy. This is friendship. But I am <lb/>
throwing my influence with the government. This <lb/>
is politics.</p>
<p>Szczepanik left for his village in Moravia day be- <lb/>
fore yesterday to "do time" for the first time under <lb/>
his sentence. Early yesterday morning he started <lb/>
for the school in a fine carriage, which was stocked <lb/>
with fruits, cakes, toys, and all sorts of knick- <lb/>
knacks, rarities, and surprises for the children, and <lb/>
was met on the road by the school and a body of <lb/>
schoolmasters from the neighboring districts, march- <lb/>
ing in column, with the village authorities at the <lb/>
head, and was received with the enthusiastic welcome <lb/>
proper to the man who had made their village's <lb/>
name celebrated, and conducted in state to the <lb/>
humble doors which had been shut against him as a <lb/>
deserter three years before. It is out of materials <lb/>
like these that romances are woven; and when the <lb/>
romancer has done his best, he has not improved <lb/>
<pb n="259"/>
upon the unpainted facts. Szczepanik put the sap- <lb/>
less school-books aside, and led the children a holi- <lb/>
day dance through the enchanted lands of science <lb/>
and invention, explaining to them some of the <lb/>
curious things which he had contrived, and the laws <lb/>
which governed their construction and performance, <lb/>
and illustrating these matters with pictures and <lb/>
models and other helps to a clear understanding of <lb/>
their fascinating mysteries. After this there was <lb/>
play and a distribution of the fruits and toys and <lb/>
things; and after this, again, some more science, <lb/>
including the story of the invention of the telephone, <lb/>
and an explanation of its character and laws, for the <lb/>
convict had brought a telephone along. The <lb/>
children saw that wonder for the first time, and they <lb/>
also personally tested its powers and verified them. <lb/>
Then school "let out"; the teacher got his certifi- <lb/>
cate, all signed, stamped, taxed, and so on, said <lb/>
good-by, and drove off in his carriage under a <lb/>
storm of "<i>Do widzenia!</i>" ("<i>Au revoir!</i>") from <lb/>
the children, who will resume their customary <lb/>
sobrieties until he comes in August and uncorks his <lb/>
flask of scientific fire-water again.</p>

<head><b>EXTRACTS FROM ADAM'S DIARY</b></head>
<p><smcap>Monday.</smcap>&#x2014;This new creature with the long hair <lb/>
is a good deal in the way. It is always hang- <lb/>
ing around and following me about. I don't like <lb/>
this; I am not used to company. I wish it would <lb/>
stay with the other animals&#x2026;. Cloudy to-day, <lb/>
wind in the east; think we shall have rain&#x2026;. <lb/>
<i>We?</i> Where did I get that word?&#x2014;I remember <lb/>
now&#x2014;the new creature uses it.</p>
<p><smcap>Tuesday</smcap>.&#x2014;Been examining the great waterfall. <lb/>
It is the finest thing on the estate, I think. The <lb/>
new creature calls it Niagara Falls&#x2014;why, I am sure <lb/>
I do not know. Says it <i>looks</i> like Niagara Falls. <lb/>
That is not a reason, it is mere waywardness and <lb/>
imbecility. I get no chance to name anything my- <lb/>
self. The new creature names everything that comes <lb/>
along, before I can get in a protest. And always <lb/>
that same pretext is offered&#x2014;it <i>looks</i> like the thing. <lb/>
There is the dodo, for instance. Says the moment <lb/>
one looks at it one sees at a glance that it "looks <lb/>
like a dodo." It will have to keep that name, no <lb/>
doubt. It wearies me to fret about it, and it does <lb/>
no good, anyway. Dodo! It looks no more like a <lb/>
dodo than I do.</p>
<p><smcap>Wednesday</smcap>.&#x2014;Built me a shelter against the rain, <lb/>
<pb n="261"/>
but could not have it to myself in peace. The new <lb/>
creature intruded. When I tried to put it out it shed <lb/>
water out of the holes it looks with, and wiped it <lb/>
away with the back of its paws, and made a noise <lb/>
such as some of the other animals make when they <lb/>
are in distress. I wish it would not talk; it is <lb/>
always talking. That sounds like a cheap fling at <lb/>
the poor creature, a slur; but I do not mean it so. <lb/>
I have never heard the human voice before, and any <lb/>
new and strange sound intruding itself here upon the <lb/>
solemn hush of these dreaming solitudes offends my <lb/>
ear and seems a false note. And this new sound is so <lb/>
close to me; it is right at my shoulder, right at my ear, <lb/>
first on one side and then on the other, and I am used <lb/>
only to sounds that are more or less distant from me.</p>
<p><smcap>Friday</smcap>.&#x2014;The naming goes recklessly on, in <lb/>
spite of anything I can do. I had a very good <lb/>
name for the estate, and it was musical and pretty <lb/>
&#x2014;<smcap>Garden of Eden</smcap>. Privately, I continue to call <lb/>
it that, but not any longer publicly. The new <lb/>
creature says it is all woods and rocks and scenery, <lb/>
and therefore has no resemblance to a garden. <lb/>
Says it <i>looks</i> like a park, and does not look like <lb/>
anything <i>but</i> a park. Consequently, without con- <lb/>
sulting me, it has been new-named&#x2014;<smcap>Niagara <lb/>
Falls Park</smcap>. This is sufficiently high-handed, it <lb/>
seems to me. And already there is a sign up: <lb/>
<q><smcap>keep off</smcap></q>
<q><smcap>the grass</smcap></q></p>
<p>My life is not as happy as it was.</p>
<pb n="262"/>
<p><smcap>Saturday</smcap>.&#x2014;The new creature eats too much <lb/>
fruit. We are going to run short, most likely. <lb/>
"We" again&#x2014;that is <i>its</i> word; mine, too, now, <lb/>
from hearing it so much. Good deal of fog this <lb/>
morning. I do not go out in the fog myself. The <lb/>
new creature does. It goes out in all weathers, and <lb/>
stumps right in with its muddy feet. And talks. It <lb/>
used to be so pleasant and quiet here.</p>
<p><smcap>Sunday</smcap>.&#x2014;Pulled through. This day is getting <lb/>
to be more and more trying. It was selected and <lb/>
set apart last November as a day of rest. I had <lb/>
already six of them per week before. This morning <lb/>
found the new creature trying to clod apples out of <lb/>
that forbidden tree.</p>
<p><smcap>Monday</smcap>.&#x2014;The new creature says its name is <lb/>
Eve. That is all right, I have no objections. Says <lb/>
it is to call it by, when I want it to come. I said it <lb/>
was superfluous, then. The word evidently raised <lb/>
me in its respect; and indeed it is a large, good <lb/>
word and will bear repetition. It says it is not an <lb/>
It, it is a She. This is probably doubtful; yet it is <lb/>
all one to me; what she is were nothing to me if she <lb/>
would but go by herself and not talk.</p>
<p><smcap>Tuesday</smcap>.&#x2014;She has littered the whole estate with <lb/>
execrable names and offensive signs: <lb/>
<q><smcap>This way to the Whirlpool.</smcap></q>
<q><smcap>This way to Goat Island.</smcap></q>
<q><smcap>Cave of the Winds this way.</smcap></q></p>
<p>She says this park would make a tidy summer <lb/>
resort if there was any custom for it. Summer <lb/>
<pb n="263"/>
resort&#x2014;another invention of hers&#x2014;just words, <lb/>
without any meaning. What is a summer resort? <lb/>
But it is best not to ask her, she has such a rage for <lb/>
explaining.</p>
<p><smcap>Friday</smcap>.&#x2014;She has taken to beseeching me to stop <lb/>
going over the Falls. What harm does it do? <lb/>
Says it makes her shudder. I wonder why; I <lb/>
have always done it&#x2014;always liked the plunge, and <lb/>
the excitement and the coolness. I supposed it was <lb/>
what the Falls were for. They have no other use <lb/>
that I can see, and they must have been made for <lb/>
something. She says they were only made for <lb/>
scenery&#x2014;like the rhinoceros and the mastodon.</p>
<p>I went over the Falls in a barrel&#x2014;not satisfactory <lb/>
to her. Went over in a tub&#x2014;still not satisfactory. <lb/>
Swam the Whirlpool and the Rapids in a fig-leaf <lb/>
suit. It got much damaged. Hence, tedious com- <lb/>
plaints about my extravagance. I am too much <lb/>
hampered here. What I need is change of scene.</p>
<p><smcap>Saturday</smcap>.&#x2014;I escaped last Tuesday night, and <lb/>
traveled two days, and built me another shelter in a <lb/>
secluded place, and obliterated my tracks as well as I <lb/>
could, but she hunted me out by means of a beast <lb/>
which she has tamed and calls a wolf, and came <lb/>
making that pitiful noise again, and shedding that <lb/>
water out of the places she looks with. I was <lb/>
obliged to return with her, but will presently emi- <lb/>
grate again when occasion offers. She engages her- <lb/>
self in many foolish things; among others, to study <lb/>
out why the animals called lions and tigers live on <lb/>
<pb n="264"/>
grass and flowers, when, as she says, the sort of teeth <lb/>
they wear would indicate that they were intended to <lb/>
eat each other. This is foolish, because to do that <lb/>
would be to kill each other, and that would introduce <lb/>
what, as I understand it, is called "death"; and <lb/>
death, as I have been told, has not yet entered the <lb/>
Park. Which is a pity, on some accounts.</p>
<p><smcap>Sunday</smcap>.&#x2014;Pulled through.</p>
<p><smcap>Monday</smcap>.&#x2014;I believe I see what the week is for: <lb/>
it is to give time to rest up from the weariness of <lb/>
Sunday. It seems a good idea&#x2026;. She has been <lb/>
climbing that tree again. Clodded her out of it. <lb/>
She said nobody was looking. Seems to consider <lb/>
that a sufficient justification for chancing any <lb/>
dangerous thing. Told her that. The word justi- <lb/>
fication moved her admiration&#x2014;and envy, too, I <lb/>
thought. It is a good word.</p>
<p><smcap>Tuesday</smcap>.&#x2014;She told me she was made out of a <lb/>
rib taken from my body. This is at least doubtful, <lb/>
if not more than that. I have not missed any rib. <lb/>
&#x2026; She is in much trouble about the buzzard; <lb/>
says grass does not agree with it; is afraid she can't <lb/>
raise it; thinks it was intended to live on decayed <lb/>
flesh. The buzzard must get along the best it can <lb/>
with what it is provided. We cannot overturn the <lb/>
whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard.</p>
<p><smcap>Saturday</smcap>.&#x2014;She fell in the pond yesterday when <lb/>
she was looking at herself in it, which she is always <lb/>
doing. She nearly strangled, and said it was most <lb/>
uncomfortable. This made her sorry for the crea- <lb/>
<pb n="265"/>
tures which live in there, which she calls fish, for <lb/>
she continues to fasten names on to things that don't <lb/>
need them and don't come when they are called by <lb/>
them, which is a matter of no consequence to her, <lb/>
she is such a numskull, anyway; so she got a lot of <lb/>
them out and brought them in last night and put <lb/>
them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed <lb/>
them now and then all day and I don't see that they <lb/>
are any happier there than they were before, only <lb/>
quieter. When night comes I shall throw them <lb/>
outdoors. I will not sleep with them again, for I <lb/>
find them clammy and unpleasant to lie among when <lb/>
a person hasn't anything on.</p>
<p><smcap>Sunday</smcap>.&#x2014;Pulled through.</p>
<p><smcap>Tuesday</smcap>.&#x2014;She has taken up with a snake now. <lb/>
The other animals are glad, for she was always ex- <lb/>
perimenting with them and bothering them; and I <lb/>
am glad because the snake talks, and this enables me <lb/>
to get a rest.</p>
<p><smcap>Friday</smcap>.&#x2014;She says the snake advises her to try <lb/>
the fruit of that tree, and says the result will be a <lb/>
great and fine and noble education. I told her there <lb/>
would be another result, too&#x2014;it would introduce <lb/>
death into the world. That was a mistake&#x2014;it had <lb/>
been better to keep the remark to myself; it only <lb/>
gave her an idea&#x2014;she could save the sick buzzard, <lb/>
and furnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and <lb/>
tigers. I advised her to keep away from the tree. <lb/>
She said she wouldn't. I foresee trouble. Will <lb/>
emigrate.</p>
<pb n="266"/>
<p><smcap>Wednesday</smcap>.&#x2014;I have had a variegated time. I <lb/>
escaped last night, and rode a horse all night as fast <lb/>
as he could go, hoping to get clear out of the Park <lb/>
and hide in some other country before the trouble <lb/>
should begin; but it was not to be. About an hour <lb/>
after sun-up, as I was riding through a flowery plain <lb/>
where thousands of animals were grazing, slumber- <lb/>
ing, or playing with each other, according to their <lb/>
wont, all of a sudden they broke into a tempest of <lb/>
frightful noises, and in one moment the plain was a <lb/>
frantic commotion and every beast was destroying <lb/>
its neighbor. I knew what it meant&#x2014;Eve had <lb/>
eaten that fruit, and death was come into the world. <lb/>
&#x2026; The tigers ate my horse, paying no attention <lb/>
when I ordered them to desist, and they would have <lb/>
eaten me if I had stayed&#x2014;which I didn't, but went <lb/>
away in much haste&#x2026;. I found this place, out- <lb/>
side the Park, and was fairly comfortable for a few <lb/>
days, but she has found me out. Found me out, <lb/>
and has named the place Tonawanda&#x2014;says it <i>looks</i> <lb/>
like that. In fact I was not sorry she came, for <lb/>
there are but meagre pickings here, and she brought <lb/>
some of those apples. I was obliged to eat them, I <lb/>
was so hungry. It was against my principles, but I <lb/>
find that principles have no real force except when <lb/>
one is well fed&#x2026;. She came curtained in boughs <lb/>
and bunches of leaves, and when I asked her what <lb/>
she meant by such nonsense, and snatched them <lb/>
away and threw them down, she tittered and <lb/>
blushed. I had never seen a person titter and blush <lb/>
<pb n="267"/>
before, and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic. <lb/>
She said I would soon know how it was myself. <lb/>
This was correct. Hungry as I was, I laid down <lb/>
the apple half-eaten&#x2014;certainly the best one I ever <lb/>
saw, considering the lateness of the season&#x2014;and <lb/>
arrayed myself in the discarded boughs and <lb/>
branches, and then spoke to her with some severity <lb/>
and ordered her to go and get some more and not <lb/>
make such a spectacle of herself. She did it, and <lb/>
after this we crept down to where the wild-beast <lb/>
battle had been, and collected some skins, and I <lb/>
made her patch together a couple of suits proper for <lb/>
public occasions. They are uncomfortable, it is <lb/>
true, but stylish, and that is the main point about <lb/>
clothes&#x2026;. I find she is a good deal of a com- <lb/>
panion. I see I should be lonesome and depressed <lb/>
without her, now that I have lost my property. <lb/>
Another thing, she says it is ordered that we work <lb/>
for our living hereafter. She will be useful. I will <lb/>
superintend.</p>
<p><smcap>Ten Days Later</smcap>.&#x2014;She accuses <i>me</i> of being the <lb/>
cause of our disaster! She says, with apparent <lb/>
sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured her that <lb/>
the forbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts. <lb/>
I said I was innocent, then, for I had not eaten any <lb/>
chestnuts. She said the Serpent informed her that <lb/>
"chestnut" was a figurative term meaning an aged <lb/>
and mouldy joke. I turned pale at that, for I have <lb/>
made many jokes to pass the weary time, and some <lb/>
of them could have been of that sort, though I had <lb/>
<pb n="268"/>
honestly supposed that they were new when I made <lb/>
them. She asked me if I had made one just at the <lb/>
time of the catastrophe. I was obliged to admit that <lb/>
I had made one to myself, though not aloud. It <lb/>
was this. I was thinking about the Falls, and I said <lb/>
to myself, "How wonderful it is to see that vast <lb/>
body of water tumble down there!" Then in an <lb/>
instant a bright thought flashed into my head, and I <lb/>
let it fly, saying, "It would be a deal more wonderful <lb/>
to see it tumble <i>up</i> there!"&#x2014;and I was just about <lb/>
to kill myself with laughing at it when all nature <lb/>
broke loose in war and death and I had to flee for <lb/>
my life. "There," she said, with triumph, "that <lb/>
is just it; the Serpent mentioned that very jest, and <lb/>
called it the First Chestnut, and said it was coeval <lb/>
with the creation." Alas, I am indeed to blame. <lb/>
Would that I were not witty; oh, that I had never <lb/>
had that radiant thought!</p>
<p><smcap>Next Year</smcap>.&#x2014;We have named it Cain. She <lb/>
caught it while I was up country trapping on the <lb/>
North Shore of the Erie; caught it in the timber a <lb/>
couple of miles from our dug-out&#x2014;or it might have <lb/>
been four, she isn't certain which. It resembles us <lb/>
in some ways, and may be a relation. That is what <lb/>
she thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment. <lb/>
The difference in size warrants the conclusion that <lb/>
it is a different and new kind of animal&#x2014;a fish, per- <lb/>
haps, though when I put it in the water to see, it <lb/>
sank, and she plunged in and snatched it out before <lb/>
there was opportunity for the experiment to deter- <lb/>
<pb n="269"/>
mine the matter. I still think it is a fish, but she is <lb/>
indifferent about what it is, and will not let me have <lb/>
it to try. I do not understand this. The coming <lb/>
of the creature seems to have changed her whole <lb/>
nature and made her unreasonable about experi- <lb/>
ments. She thinks more of it than she does of any <lb/>
of the other animals, but is not able to explain why. <lb/>
Her mind is disordered&#x2014;everything shows it. <lb/>
Sometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the <lb/>
night when it complains and wants to get to the <lb/>
water. At such times the water comes out of the <lb/>
places in her face that she looks out of, and she pats <lb/>
the fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her <lb/>
mouth to soothe it, and betrays sorrow and solicitude <lb/>
in a hundred ways. I have never seen her do like <lb/>
this with any other fish, and it troubles me greatly. <lb/>
She used to carry the young tigers around so, and <lb/>
play with them, before we lost our property, but it <lb/>
was only play; she never took on about them like <lb/>
this when their dinner disagreed with them.</p>
<p><smcap>Sunday</smcap>.&#x2014;She doesn't work, Sundays, but lies <lb/>
around all tired out, and likes to have the fish wallow <lb/>
over her; and she makes fool noises to amuse it, <lb/>
and pretends to chew its paws, and that makes it <lb/>
laugh. I have not seen a fish before that could <lb/>
laugh. This makes me doubt&#x2026;. I have come <lb/>
to like Sunday myself. Superintending all the week <lb/>
tires a body so. There ought to be more Sundays. <lb/>
In the old days they were tough, but now they <lb/>
come handy.</p>
<pb n="270"/>
<p><smcap>Wednesday</smcap>.&#x2014;It isn't a fish. I cannot quite <lb/>
make out what it is. It makes curious devilish <lb/>
noises when not satisfied, and says "goo-goo" <lb/>
when it is. It is not one of us, for it doesn't walk; <lb/>
it is not a bird, for it doesn't fly; it is not a frog, <lb/>
for it doesn't hop; it is not a snake, for it doesn't <lb/>
crawl; I feel sure it is not a fish, though I cannot <lb/>
get a chance to find out whether it can swim or not. <lb/>
It merely lies around, and mostly on its back, with <lb/>
its feet up. I have not seen any other animal do <lb/>
that before. I said I believed it was an enigma; but <lb/>
she only admired the word without understanding it. <lb/>
In my judgment it is either an enigma or some kind <lb/>
of a bug. If it dies, I will take it apart and see what <lb/>
its arrangements are. I never had a thing perplex <lb/>
me so.</p>
<p><smcap>Three Months Later</smcap>.&#x2014;The perplexity aug- <lb/>
ments instead of diminishing. I sleep but little. It <lb/>
has ceased from lying around, and goes about on its <lb/>
four legs now. Yet it differs from the other four- <lb/>
legged animals, in that its front legs are unusually <lb/>
short, consequently this causes the main part of its <lb/>
person to stick up uncomfortably high in the air, and <lb/>
this is not attractive. It is built much as we are, <lb/>
but its method of traveling shows that it is not of <lb/>
our breed. The short front legs and long hind ones <lb/>
indicate that it is of the kangaroo family, but it is a <lb/>
marked variation of the species, since the true kan- <lb/>
garoo hops, whereas this one never does. Still it is <lb/>
a curious and interesting variety, and has not been <lb/>
<pb n="271"/>
catalogued before. As I discovered it, I have felt <lb/>
justified in securing the credit of the discovery by <lb/>
attaching my name to it, and hence have called it <lb/>
<i>Kangaroorum Adamiensis</i>&#x2026;. It must have been <lb/>
a young one when it came, for it has grown exceed- <lb/>
ingly since. It must be five times as big, now, as it <lb/>
was then, and when discontented it is able to make <lb/>
from twenty-two to thirty-eight times the noise it <lb/>
made at first. Coercion does not modify this, but <lb/>
has the contrary effect. For this reason I discon- <lb/>
tinued the system. She reconciles it by persuasion, <lb/>
and by giving it things which she had previously told <lb/>
it she wouldn't give it. As already observed, I was <lb/>
not at home when it first came, and she told me she <lb/>
found it in the woods. It seems odd that it should <lb/>
be the only one, yet it must be so, for I have worn <lb/>
myself out these many weeks trying to find another <lb/>
one to add to my collection, and for this one to play <lb/>
with; for surely then it would be quieter and we <lb/>
could tame it more easily. But I find none, nor any <lb/>
vestige of any; and strangest of all, no tracks. It <lb/>
has to live on the ground, it cannot help itself; <lb/>
therefore, how does it get about without leaving a <lb/>
track? I have set a dozen traps, but they do no <lb/>
good. I catch all small animals except that one; <lb/>
animals that merely go into the trap out of curiosity, <lb/>
I think, to see what the milk is there for. They <lb/>
never drink it.</p>
<p><smcap>Three Months Later</smcap>.&#x2014;The Kangaroo still <lb/>
continues to grow, which is very strange and per- <lb/>
<pb n="272"/>
plexing. I never knew one to be so long getting its <lb/>
growth. It has fur on its head now; not like <lb/>
kangaroo fur, but exactly like our hair except that <lb/>
it is much finer and softer, and instead of being <lb/>
black is red. I am like to lose my mind over the <lb/>
capricious and harassing developments of this un- <lb/>
classifiable zo&#x00F6;logical freak. If I could catch <lb/>
another one&#x2014;but that is hopeless; it is a new <lb/>
variety, and the only sample; this is plain. But I <lb/>
caught a true kangaroo and brought it in, thinking <lb/>
that this one, being lonesome, would rather have <lb/>
that for company than have no kin at all, or any <lb/>
animal it could feel a nearness to or get sympathy <lb/>
from in its forlorn condition here among strangers <lb/>
who do not know its ways or habits, or what to do <lb/>
to make it feel that it is among friends; but it was <lb/>
a mistake&#x2014;it went into such fits at the sight of the <lb/>
kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen one <lb/>
before. I pity the poor noisy little animal, but there <lb/>
is nothing I can do to make it happy. If I could <lb/>
tame it&#x2014;but that is out of the question; the more <lb/>
I try the worse I seem to make it. It grieves me to <lb/>
the heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and <lb/>
passion. I wanted to let it go, but she wouldn't <lb/>
hear of it. That seemed cruel and not like her; and <lb/>
yet she may be right. It might be lonelier than <lb/>
ever; for since I cannot find another one, how could <lb/>
<i>it?</i></p>
<p><smcap>Five Months Later</smcap>.&#x2014;It is not a kangaroo. <lb/>
No, for it supports itself by holding to her finger, <lb/>
<pb n="273"/>
and thus goes a few steps on its hind legs, and then <lb/>
falls down. It is probably some kind of a bear; <lb/>
and yet it has no tail&#x2014;as yet&#x2014;and no fur, except <lb/>
on its head. It still keeps on growing&#x2014;that is a <lb/>
curious circumstance, for bears get their growth <lb/>
earlier than this. Bears are dangerous&#x2014;since our <lb/>
catastrophe&#x2014;and I shall not be satisfied to have this <lb/>
one prowling about the place much longer without a <lb/>
muzzle on. I have offered to get her a kangaroo if <lb/>
she would let this one go, but it did no good&#x2014;she <lb/>
is determined to run us into all sorts of foolish risks, <lb/>
I think. She was not like this before she lost her <lb/>
mind.</p>
<p><smcap>A Fortnight Later</smcap>.&#x2014;I examined its mouth. <lb/>
There is no danger yet: it has only one tooth. It <lb/>
has no tail yet. It makes more noise now than it <lb/>
ever did before&#x2014;and mainly at night. I have <lb/>
moved out. But I shall go over, mornings, to <lb/>
breakfast, and see if it has more teeth. If it gets a <lb/>
mouthful of teeth it will be time for it to go, tail or <lb/>
no tail, for a bear does not need a tail in order to be <lb/>
dangerous.</p>
<p><smcap>Four Months Later</smcap>.&#x2014;I have been off hunting <lb/>
and fishing a month, up in the region that she calls <lb/>
Buffalo; I don't know why, unless it is because there <lb/>
are not any buffaloes there. Meantime the bear has <lb/>
learned to paddle around all by itself on its hind <lb/>
legs, and says "poppa" and "momma." It is <lb/>
certainly a new species. This resemblance to words <lb/>
may be purely accidental, of course, and may have <lb/>
<pb n="274"/>
no purpose or meaning; but even in that case it is <lb/>
still extraordinary, and is a thing which no other <lb/>
bear can do. This imitation of speech, taken <lb/>
together with general absence of fur and entire <lb/>
absence of tail, sufficiently indicates that this is a <lb/>
new kind of bear. The further study of it will be <lb/>
exceedingly interesting. Meantime I will go off on <lb/>
a far expedition among the forests of the north and <lb/>
make an exhaustive search. There must certainly be <lb/>
another one somewhere, and this one will be less <lb/>
dangerous when it has company of its own species. <lb/>
I will go straightway; but I will muzzle this one <lb/>
first.</p>
<p><smcap>Three Months Later</smcap>.&#x2014;It has been a weary, <lb/>
weary hunt, yet I have had no success. In the <lb/>
meantime, without stirring from the home estate, she <lb/>
has caught another one! I never saw such luck. <lb/>
I might have hunted these woods a hundred years, I <lb/>
never would have run across that thing.</p>
<p><smcap>Next Day</smcap>.&#x2014;I have been comparing the new one <lb/>
with the old one, and it is perfectly plain that they <lb/>
are the same breed. I was going to stuff one of <lb/>
them for my collection, but she is prejudiced against <lb/>
it for some reason or other; so I have relinquished <lb/>
the idea, though I think it is a mistake. It would <lb/>
be an irreparable loss to science if they should get <lb/>
away. The old one is tamer than it was and can <lb/>
laugh and talk like the parrot, having learned this, <lb/>
no doubt, from being with the parrot so much, and <lb/>
having the imitative faculty in a highly developed <lb/>
<pb n="275"/>
degree. I shall be astonished if it turns out to be <lb/>
a new kind of parrot; and yet I ought not to be <lb/>
astonished, for it has already been everything else it <lb/>
could think of since those first days when it was <lb/>
a fish. The new one is as ugly now as the old one <lb/>
was at first; has the same sulphur-and-raw-meat <lb/>
complexion and the same singular head without any <lb/>
fur on it. She calls it Abel.</p>
<p><smcap>Ten Years Later</smcap>.&#x2014;They are <i>boys;</i> we found it <lb/>
out long ago. It was their coming in that small, <lb/>
immature shape that puzzled us; we were not used <lb/>
to it. There are some girls now. Abel is a good <lb/>
boy, but if Cain had stayed a bear it would have <lb/>
improved him. After all these years, I see that I <lb/>
was mistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better <lb/>
to live outside the Garden with her than inside it <lb/>
without her. At first I thought she talked too <lb/>
much; but now I should be sorry to have that voice <lb/>
fall silent and pass out of my life. Blessed be the <lb/>
chestnut that brought us near together and taught <lb/>
me to know the goodness of her heart and the sweet- <lb/>
ness of her spirit!</p>

<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head>I</head>
<p><smcap>This</smcap> was in Oliver Cromwell's time. Colonel <lb/>
Mayfair was the youngest officer of his rank <lb/>
in the armies of the Commonwealth, he being but <lb/>
thirty years old. But young as he was, he was a <lb/>
veteran soldier, and tanned and warworn, for he <lb/>
had begun his military life at seventeen; he had <lb/>
fought in many battles, and had won his high place <lb/>
in the service and in the admiration of men, step <lb/>
by step, by valor in the field. But he was in deep <lb/>
trouble now; a shadow had fallen upon his fortunes.</p>
<p>The winter evening was come, and outside were <lb/>
storm and darkness; within, a melancholy silence; <lb/>
for the Colonel and his young wife had talked their <lb/>
sorrow out, had read the evening chapter and prayed <lb/>
the evening prayer, and there was nothing more to <lb/>
do but sit hand in hand and gaze into the fire, and <lb/>
think&#x2014;and wait. They would not have to wait <lb/>
long; they knew that, and the wife shuddered at <lb/>
the thought.</p>
<pb n="277"/>
<p>They had one child&#x2014;Abby, seven years old, their <lb/>
idol. She would be coming presently for the good- <lb/>
night kiss, and the Colonel spoke now, and said:</p>
<p>"Dry away the tears and let us seem happy, for <lb/>
her sake. We must forget, for the time, that which <lb/>
is to happen."</p>
<p>"I will. I will shut them up in my heart, which <lb/>
is breaking."</p>
<p>"And we will accept what is appointed for us, <lb/>
and bear it in patience, as knowing that whatsoever <lb/>
He doeth is done in righteousness and meant in <lb/>
kindness&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Saying, His will be done. Yes, I can say it <lb/>
with all my mind and soul&#x2014;I would I could say <lb/>
it with my heart. Oh, if I could! if this dear hand <lb/>
which I press and kiss for the last time&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"'Sh! sweetheart, she is coming!"</p>
<p>A curly-headed little figure in nightclothes glided <lb/>
in at the door and ran to the father, and was gathered <lb/>
to his breast and fervently kissed once, twice, three <lb/>
times.</p>
<p>"Why, papa, you mustn't kiss me like that: <lb/>
you rumple my hair."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am so sorry&#x2014;so sorry: do you forgive <lb/>
me, dear?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course, papa. But <i>are</i> you sorry?&#x2014; <lb/>
not pretending, but real, right down sorry?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can judge for yourself, Abby," and <lb/>
he covered his face with his hands and made believe <lb/>
to sob. The child was filled with remorse to see this <lb/>
<pb n="278"/>
tragic thing which she had caused, and she began to <lb/>
cry herself, and to tug at the hands, and say:</p>
<p>"Oh, don't, papa, please don't cry; Abby didn't <lb/>
mean it; Abby wouldn't ever do it again. Please, <lb/>
papa!" Tugging and straining to separate the <lb/>
fingers, she got a fleeting glimpse of an eye behind <lb/>
them, and cried out: "Why, you naughty papa, <lb/>
you are not crying at all! You are only fooling! <lb/>
And Abby is going to mamma, now: you don't <lb/>
treat Abby right."</p>
<p>She was for climbing down, but her father wound <lb/>
his arms about her and said: "No, stay with me, <lb/>
dear: papa <i>was</i> naughty, and confesses it, and is <lb/>
sorry&#x2014;there, let him kiss the tears away&#x2014;and he <lb/>
begs Abby's forgiveness, and will do anything Abby <lb/>
says he must do, for a punishment; they're all <lb/>
kissed away now, and not a curl rumpled&#x2014;and <lb/>
whatever Abby commands&#x2014;"</p>
<p>And so it was made up; and all in a moment the <lb/>
sunshine was back again and burning brightly in the <lb/>
child's face, and she was patting her father's cheeks <lb/>
and naming the penalty&#x2014;"A story! a story!"</p>
<p>Hark!</p>
<p>The elders stopped breathing, and listened. Foot- <lb/>
steps! faintly caught between the gusts of wind. <lb/>
They came nearer, nearer&#x2014;louder, louder&#x2014;then <lb/>
passed by and faded away. The elders drew deep <lb/>
breaths of relief, and the papa said: "A story, is <lb/>
it? A gay one?"</p>
<p>"No, papa: a dreadful one."</p>
<pb n="279"/>
<p>Papa wanted to shift to the gay kind, but the child <lb/>
stood by her rights&#x2014;as per agreement, she was to <lb/>
have anything she commanded. He was a good <lb/>
Puritan soldier and had passed his word&#x2014;he saw <lb/>
that he must make it good. She said:</p>
<p>"Papa, we mustn't always have gay ones. Nurse <lb/>
says people don't always have gay times. Is that <lb/>
true, papa? She <i>says</i> so."</p>
<p>The mamma sighed, and her thoughts drifted to <lb/>
her troubles again. The papa said, gently: "It is <lb/>
true, dear. Troubles have to come; it is a pity, <lb/>
but it is true."</p>
<p>"Oh, then tell a story about them, papa&#x2014;a <lb/>
dreadful one, so that we'll shiver, and feel just as if <lb/>
it was <i>us</i>. Mamma, you snuggle up close, and hold <lb/>
one of Abby's hands, so that if it's too dreadful it'll <lb/>
be easier for us to bear it if we are all snuggled up <lb/>
together, you know. Now you can begin, papa."</p>
<p>"Well, once there were three Colonels&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, goody! <i>I</i> know Colonels, just as easy! <lb/>
It's because you are one, and I know the clothes. <lb/>
Go on, papa."</p>
<p>"And in a battle they had committed a breach of <lb/>
discipline."</p>
<p>The large words struck the child's ear pleasantly, <lb/>
and she looked up, full of wonder and interest, and <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Is it something good to eat, papa?"</p>
<p>The parents almost smiled, and the father <lb/>
answered:</p>
<pb n="280"/>
<p>"No, quite another matter, dear. They ex- <lb/>
ceeded their orders."</p>
<p>"Is <i>that</i> someth&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"No; it's as uneatable as the other. They were <lb/>
ordered to feign an attack on a strong position in a <lb/>
losing fight, in order to draw the enemy about and <lb/>
give the Commonwealth's forces a chance to retreat; <lb/>
but in their enthusiasm they overstepped their <lb/>
orders, for they turned the feint into a fact, and <lb/>
carried the position by storm, and won the day and <lb/>
the battle. The Lord General was very angry at <lb/>
their disobedience, and praised them highly, and <lb/>
ordered them to London to be tried for their lives."</p>
<p>"Is it the great General Cromwell, papa?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh, I've seen <i>him</i>, papa! and when he goes by <lb/>
our house so grand on his big horse, with the <lb/>
soldiers, he looks so&#x2014;so&#x2014;well, I don't know just <lb/>
how, only he looks as if he isn't satisfied, and you <lb/>
can see the people are afraid of him; but <i>I'm</i> not <lb/>
afraid of him, because he didn't look like that at <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"Oh, you dear prattler! Well, the Colonels <lb/>
came prisoners to London, and were put upon their <lb/>
honor, and allowed to go and see their families for <lb/>
the last&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Hark!</p>
<p>They listened. Footsteps again; but again they <lb/>
passed by. The mamma leaned her head upon her <lb/>
husband's shoulder to hide her paleness.</p>
<pb n="281"/>
<p>"They arrived this morning."</p>
<p>The child's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>"Why, papa! is it a <i>true</i> story?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear."</p>
<p>"Oh, how good! Oh, it's ever so much better! <lb/>
Go on, papa. Why, mamma!&#x2014;<i>dear</i> mamma, are <lb/>
you crying?"</p>
<p>"Never mind me, dear&#x2014;I was thinking of the&#x2014; <lb/>
of the&#x2014;the poor families."</p>
<p>"But <i>don't</i> cry, mamma: it'll all come out right <lb/>
&#x2014;you'll see; stories always do. Go on, papa, to <lb/>
where they lived happy ever after; then she won't <lb/>
cry any more. You'll see, mamma. Go on, papa."</p>
<p>"First, they took them to the Tower before they <lb/>
let them go home."</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> know the Tower! We can see it from <lb/>
here. Go on, papa."</p>
<p>"I am going on as well as I can, in the circum- <lb/>
stances. In the Tower the military court tried them <lb/>
for an hour, and found them guilty, and condemned <lb/>
them to be shot."</p>
<p>"<i>Killed</i>, papa?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh, how naughty! <i>Dear</i> mamma, you are cry- <lb/>
ing again. Don't, mamma; it'll soon come to the <lb/>
good place&#x2014;you'll see. Hurry, papa, for mam- <lb/>
ma's sake; you don't go fast enough."</p>
<p>"I know I don't, but I suppose it is because I <lb/>
stop so much to reflect."</p>
<p>"But you mustn't <i>do</i> it, papa; you must go right <lb/>
on."</p>
<pb n="282"/>
<p>"Very well, then. The three Colonels&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Do you know them, papa?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wish I did! I love Colonels. Would <lb/>
they let me kiss them, do you think?" The <lb/>
Colonel's voice was a little unsteady when he <lb/>
answered&#x2014;</p>
<p>"<i>One</i> of them would, my darling! There&#x2014;kiss <lb/>
me for him."</p>
<p>"There, papa&#x2014;and these two are for the others. <lb/>
I think they would let me kiss them, papa; for I <lb/>
would say, 'My papa is a Colonel, too, and brave, <lb/>
and he would do what you did; so it <i>can't</i> be <lb/>
wrong, no matter what those people say, and you <lb/>
needn't be the least bit ashamed;' then they would <lb/>
let me,&#x2014;wouldn't they, papa?"</p>
<p>"God knows they would, child!"</p>
<p>"Mamma!&#x2014;oh, mamma, you mustn't. He's <lb/>
soon coming to the happy place; go on, papa."</p>
<p>"Then, some were sorry&#x2014;they all were; that <lb/>
military court, I mean; and they went to the Lord <lb/>
General, and said they had done their duty&#x2014;for it <lb/>
<i>was</i> their duty, you know&#x2014;and now they begged <lb/>
that two of the Colonels might be spared, and only <lb/>
the other one shot. One would be sufficient for an <lb/>
example for the army, they thought. But the Lord <lb/>
General was very stern, and rebuked them foras- <lb/>
much as, having done <i>their</i> duty and cleared their <lb/>
consciences, they would beguile him to do less, and <lb/>
so smirch his soldierly honor. But they answered <lb/>
<pb n="283"/>
that they were asking nothing of him that they <lb/>
would not do themselves if they stood in his great <lb/>
place and held in their hands the noble prerogative <lb/>
of mercy. That struck him, and he paused and <lb/>
stood thinking, some of the sternness passing out of <lb/>
his face. Presently he bid them wait, and he retired <lb/>
to his closet to seek counsel of God in prayer; and <lb/>
when he came again, he said: 'They shall cast lots. <lb/>
That shall decide it, and two of them shall live.'"</p>
<p>"And did they, papa, did they? And which one <lb/>
is to die?&#x2014;ah, that poor man!"</p>
<p>"No. They refused."</p>
<p>"They wouldn't do it, papa?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"They said that the one that got the fatal bean <lb/>
would be sentencing himself to death by his own <lb/>
voluntary act, and it would be but suicide, call it by <lb/>
what name one might. They said they were Chris- <lb/>
tians, and the Bible forbade men to take their own <lb/>
lives. They sent back that word, and said they were <lb/>
ready&#x2014;let the court's sentence be carried into effect."</p>
<p>"What does that mean, papa?"</p>
<p>"They&#x2014;they will all be shot."</p>
<p>Hark!</p>
<p>The wind? No. Tramp&#x2014;tramp&#x2014;tramp&#x2014; <lb/>
r-r-r-umble-dumdum, r-r-rumble-dumdum&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Open&#x2014;in the Lord General's name!"</p>
<p>"Oh, goody, papa, it's the soldiers!&#x2014;I love the <lb/>
soldiers! Let <i>me</i> let them in, papa, let <i>me!</i>"</p>
<pb n="284"/>
<p>She jumped down, and scampered to the door <lb/>
and pulled it open, crying joyously: "Come in! <lb/>
come in! Here they are, papa! Grenadiers! <i>I</i> <lb/>
know the Grenadiers!"</p>
<p>The file marched in and straightened up in line at <lb/>
shoulder arms; its officer saluted, the doomed <lb/>
Colonel standing erect and returning the courtesy, <lb/>
the soldier wife standing at his side, white, and with <lb/>
features drawn with inward pain, but giving no <lb/>
other sign of her misery, the child gazing on the <lb/>
show with dancing eyes&#x2026;.</p>
<p>One long embrace, of father, mother, and child; <lb/>
then the order, "To the Tower&#x2014;forward!" <lb/>
Then the Colonel marched forth from the house <lb/>
with military step and bearing, the file following; <lb/>
then the door closed.</p>
<p>"Oh, mamma, didn't it come out beautiful! I <lb/>
<i>told</i> you it would; and they're going to the Tower, <lb/>
and he'll <i>see</i> them! He&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Oh, come to my arms, you poor innocent <lb/>
thing!" &#x2026;.</p>
</div3>

<p>The next morning the stricken mother was not <lb/>
able to leave her bed; doctors and nurses were <lb/>
watching by her, and whispering together now and <lb/>
then; Abby could not be allowed in the room; she <lb/>
was told to run and play&#x2014;mamma was very ill. <lb/>
The child, muffled in winter wraps, went out and <lb/>
played in the street awhile; then it struck her as <lb/>
<pb n="285"/>
strange, and also wrong, that her papa should be <lb/>
allowed to stay at the Tower in ignorance at such a <lb/>
time as this. This must be remedied; she would <lb/>
attend to it in person.</p>
<p>An hour later the military court were ushered into <lb/>
the presence of the Lord General. He stood grim <lb/>
and erect, with his knuckles resting upon the table, <lb/>
and indicated that he was ready to listen. The <lb/>
spokesman said: "We have urged them to recon- <lb/>
sider; we have implored them: but they persist. <lb/>
They will not cast lots. They are willing to die, <lb/>
but not to defile their religion."</p>
<p>The Protector's face darkened, but he said noth- <lb/>
ing. He remained a time in thought, then he said: <lb/>
"They shall not all die; the lots shall be cast <i>for</i> <lb/>
them." Gratitude shone in the faces of the court. <lb/>
"Send for them. Place them in that room there. <lb/>
Stand them side by side with their faces to the wall <lb/>
and their wrists crossed behind them. Let me have <lb/>
notice when they are there."</p>
<p>When he was alone he sat down, and presently <lb/>
gave this order to an attendant: "Go, bring me the <lb/>
first little child that passes by."</p>
<p>The man was hardly out at the door before he was <lb/>
back again&#x2014;leading Abby by the hand, her gar- <lb/>
ments lightly powdered with snow. She went <lb/>
straight to the Head of the State, that formidable <lb/>
personage at the mention of whose name the princi- <lb/>
palities and powers of the earth trembled, and <lb/>
climbed up in his lap, and said:</p>
<pb n="286"/>
<p>"I know <i>you</i>, sir: you are the Lord General; I <lb/>
have seen you; I have seen you when you went by <lb/>
my house. Everybody was afraid; but <i>I</i> wasn't <lb/>
afraid, because you didn't look cross at <i>me;</i> you <lb/>
remember, don't you? I had on my red frock&#x2014; <lb/>
the one with the blue things on it down the front. <lb/>
Don't you remember that?"</p>
<p>A smile softened the austere lines of the Pro- <lb/>
tector's face, and he began to struggle diplomatically <lb/>
with his answer:</p>
<p>"Why, let me see&#x2014;I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"I was standing right by the house&#x2014;<i>my</i> house, <lb/>
you know."</p>
<p>"Well, you dear little thing, I ought to be <lb/>
ashamed, but you know&#x2014;"</p>
<p>The child interrupted, reproachfully:</p>
<p>"Now you <i>don't</i> remember it. Why, I didn't <lb/>
forget <i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"Now I <i>am</i> ashamed: but I will never forget you <lb/>
again, dear; you have my word for it. You will <lb/>
forgive me now, won't you, and be good friends <lb/>
with me, always and forever?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed I will, though I don't know how <lb/>
you came to forget it; you must be very forgetful: <lb/>
but I am too, sometimes. I can forgive you with- <lb/>
out any trouble, for I think you <i>mean</i> to be good <lb/>
and do right, and I think you are just as kind&#x2014;but <lb/>
you must snuggle me better, the way papa does&#x2014; <lb/>
it's cold."</p>
<p>"You shall be snuggled to your heart's content, <lb/>
<pb n="287"/>
little new friend of mine, always to be <i>old</i> friend of <lb/>
mine hereafter, isn't it? You mind me of my little <lb/>
girl&#x2014;not little any more, now&#x2014;but she was dear, <lb/>
and sweet, and daintily made, like you. And she <lb/>
had your charm, little witch&#x2014;your all-conquering <lb/>
sweet confidence in friend and stranger alike, that <lb/>
wins to willing slavery any upon whom its precious <lb/>
compliment falls. She used to lie in my arms, just <lb/>
as you are doing now; and charm the weariness and <lb/>
care out of my heart and give it peace, just as <lb/>
you are doing now; and we were comrades, and <lb/>
equals, and playfellows together. Ages ago it <lb/>
was, since that pleasant heaven faded away and <lb/>
vanished, and you have brought it back again;&#x2014; <lb/>
take a burdened man's blessing for it, you tiny <lb/>
creature, who are carrying the weight of England <lb/>
while I rest!"</p>
<p>"Did you love her very, very, <i>very</i> much?"</p>
<p>"Ah, you shall judge by this: she commanded <lb/>
and I obeyed!"</p>
<p>"I think you are lovely! Will you kiss me?"</p>
<p>"Thankfully&#x2014;and hold it a privilege, too. <lb/>
There&#x2014;this one is for you; and there&#x2014;this one <lb/>
is for her. You made it a request; and you could <lb/>
have made it a command, for you are representing <lb/>
her, and what you command I must obey."</p>
<p>The child clapped her hands with delight at the <lb/>
idea of this grand promotion&#x2014;then her ear caught <lb/>
an approaching sound: the measured tramp of <lb/>
marching men.</p>
<pb n="288"/>
<p>"Soldiers!&#x2014;soldiers, Lord General! Abby <lb/>
wants to see them!"</p>
<p>"You shall, dear; but wait a moment, I have a <lb/>
commission for you."</p>
<p>An officer entered and bowed low, saying, "They <lb/>
are come, your Highness," bowed again, and retired.</p>
<p>The Head of the Nation gave Abby three little <lb/>
disks of sealing-wax: two white, and one a ruddy <lb/>
red&#x2014;for this one's mission was to deliver death to <lb/>
the Colonel who should get it.</p>
<p>"Oh, what a lovely red one! Are they for me?"</p>
<p>"No, dear; they are for others. Lift the corner <lb/>
of that curtain, there, which hides an open door; <lb/>
pass through, and you will see three men standing <lb/>
in a row, with their backs toward you and their <lb/>
hands behind their backs&#x2014;so&#x2014;each with one hand <lb/>
open, like a cup. Into each of the open hands drop <lb/>
one of those things, then come back to me."</p>
<p>Abby disappeared behind the curtain, and the <lb/>
Protector was alone. He said, reverently: "Of a <lb/>
surety that good thought came to me in my per- <lb/>
plexity from Him who is an ever present help to <lb/>
them that are in doubt and seek His aid. He <lb/>
knoweth where the choice should fall, and has sent <lb/>
His sinless messenger to do His will. Another <lb/>
would err, but He cannot err. Wonderful are His <lb/>
ways, and wise&#x2014;blessed be His holy Name!"</p>
<p>The small fairy dropped the curtain behind her <lb/>
and stood for a moment conning with alert curiosity <lb/>
the appointments of the chamber of doom, and the <lb/>
<pb n="289"/>
rigid figures of the soldiery and the prisoners; then <lb/>
her face lighted merrily, and she said to herself: <lb/>
"Why, one of them is papa! I know his back. <lb/>
He shall have the prettiest one!" She tripped <lb/>
gayly forward and dropped the disks into the open <lb/>
hands, then peeped around under her father's arm <lb/>
and lifted her laughing face and cried out:</p>
<p>"Papa! papa! look what you've got. <i>I</i> gave it <lb/>
to you!"</p>
<p>He glanced at the fatal gift, then sunk to his <lb/>
knees and gathered his innocent little executioner to <lb/>
his breast in an agony of love and pity. Soldiers, <lb/>
officers, released prisoners, all stood paralyzed, for <lb/>
a moment, at the vastness of this tragedy, then the <lb/>
pitiful scene smote their hearts, their eyes filled, and <lb/>
they wept unashamed. There was deep and rever- <lb/>
ent silence during some minutes, then the officer of <lb/>
the guard moved reluctantly forward and touched <lb/>
his prisoner on the shoulder, saying, gently:</p>
<p>"It grieves me, sir, but my duty commands."</p>
<p>"Commands what?" said the child.</p>
<p>"I must take him away. I am so sorry."</p>
<p>"Take him away? Where?"</p>
<p>"To&#x2014;to&#x2014;God help me!&#x2014;to another part of <lb/>
the fortress."</p>
<p>"Indeed you can't. My mamma is sick, and I <lb/>
am going to take him home." She released herself <lb/>
and climbed upon her father's back and put her <lb/>
arms around his neck. "Now Abby's ready, papa <lb/>
&#x2014;come along."</p>
<pb n="290"/>
<p>"My poor child, I can't. I must go with them."</p>
<p>The child jumped to the ground and looked about <lb/>
her, wondering. Then she ran and stood before the <lb/>
officer and stamped her small foot indignantly and <lb/>
cried out:</p>
<p>"I told you my mamma is sick, and you might <lb/>
have listened. Let him go&#x2014;you <i>must!</i>"</p>
<p>"Oh, poor child, would God I could, but indeed <lb/>
I must take him away. Attention, guard! &#x2026;. <lb/>
fall in! &#x2026;. shoulder arms!" &#x2026;.</p>
<p>Abby was gone&#x2014;like a flash of light. In a <lb/>
moment she was back, dragging the Lord Protector <lb/>
by the hand. At this formidable apparition all <lb/>
present straightened up, the officers saluting and the <lb/>
soldiers presenting arms.</p>
<p>"Stop them, sir! My mamma is sick and wants <lb/>
my papa, and I <i>told</i> them so, but they never even <lb/>
listened to me, and are taking him away."</p>
<p>The Lord General stood as one dazed.</p>
<p>"<i>Your</i> papa, child? Is he your papa?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course&#x2014;he was <i>always</i> it. Would I <lb/>
give the pretty red one to any other, when I love <lb/>
him so? No!"</p>
<p>A shocked expression rose in the Protector's face, <lb/>
and he said:</p>
<p>"Ah, God help me! through Satan's wiles I have <lb/>
done the cruelest thing that ever man did&#x2014;and <lb/>
there is no help, no help! What can I do?"</p>
<p>Abby cried out, distressed and impatient: "Why, <lb/>
you can make them let him go," and she began to <lb/>
<pb n="291"/>
sob. "Tell them to do it! You told me to com- <lb/>
mand, and now the very first time I tell you to do a <lb/>
thing you don't do it!"</p>
<p>A tender light dawned in the rugged old face, and <lb/>
the Lord General laid his hand upon the small <lb/>
tyrant's head and said: "God be thanked for the <lb/>
saving accident of that unthinking promise; and <lb/>
you, inspired by Him, for reminding me of my for- <lb/>
gotten pledge, O incomparable child! Officer, <lb/>
obey her command&#x2014;she speaks by my mouth. <lb/>
The prisoner is pardoned; set him free!"</p>

<head><b>A DOUBLE-BARRELED DETECTIVE <lb/>
STORY</b></head>
<div3 type="section" n="I">
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> first scene is in the country, in Virginia; the <lb/>
time, 1880. There has been a wedding, be- <lb/>
tween a handsome young man of slender means and <lb/>
a rich young girl&#x2014;a case of love at first sight and a <lb/>
precipitate marriage; a marriage bitterly opposed by <lb/>
the girl's widowed father.</p>
<p>Jacob Fuller, the bridegroom, is twenty-six years <lb/>
old, is of an old but unconsidered family which had <lb/>
by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor, and for <lb/>
King James's purse's profit, so everybody said&#x2014; <lb/>
some maliciously, the rest merely because they be- <lb/>
lieved it. The bride is nineteen and beautiful. She <lb/>
is intense, high-strung, romantic, immeasurably <lb/>
proud of her Cavalier blood, and passionate in her <lb/>
love for her young husband. For its sake she <lb/>
braved her father's displeasure, endured his re- <lb/>
proaches, listened with loyalty unshaken to his warn- <lb/>
ing predictions, and went from his house without his <lb/>
<pb n="294"/>
blessing, proud and happy in the proofs she was <lb/>
thus giving of the quality of the affection which had <lb/>
made its home in her heart.</p>
<p>The morning after the marriage there was a sad <lb/>
surprise for her. Her husband put aside her prof- <lb/>
fered caresses, and said:</p>
<p>"Sit down. I have something to say to you. I <lb/>
loved you. That was before I asked your father to <lb/>
give you to me. His refusal is not my grievance&#x2014; <lb/>
I could have endured that. But the things he said <lb/>
of me to you&#x2014;that is a different matter. There&#x2014; <lb/>
you needn't speak; I know quite well what they <lb/>
were; I got them from authentic sources. Among <lb/>
other things he said that my character was written in <lb/>
my face; that I was treacherous, a dissembler, a <lb/>
coward, and a brute without sense of pity or com- <lb/>
passion: the 'Sedgemoor trade-mark,' he called it <lb/>
&#x2014;and 'white-sleeve badge.' Any other man in my <lb/>
place would have gone to his house and shot him <lb/>
down like a dog. I wanted to do it, and was minded <lb/>
to do it, but a better thought came to me: to put him <lb/>
to shame; to break his heart; to kill him by inches. <lb/>
How to do it? Through my treatment of you, his <lb/>
idol! I would marry you; and then&#x2014; Have <lb/>
patience. You will see."</p>
<p>From that moment onward, for three months, the <lb/>
young wife suffered all the humiliations, all the in- <lb/>
sults, all the miseries that the diligent and inventive <lb/>
mind of the husband could contrive, save physical <lb/>
injuries only. Her strong pride stood by her, and <lb/>
<pb n="295"/>
she kept the secret of her troubles. Now and then <lb/>
the husband said, "Why don't you go to your <lb/>
father and tell him?" Then he invented new tor- <lb/>
tures, applied them, and asked again. She always <lb/>
answered, "He shall never know by my mouth," <lb/>
and taunted him with his origin; said she was the <lb/>
lawful slave of a scion of slaves, and must obey, and <lb/>
would&#x2014;up to that point, but no further; he could <lb/>
kill her if he liked, but he could not break her; it <lb/>
was not in the Sedgemoor breed to do it. At the <lb/>
end of the three months he said, with a dark signifi- <lb/>
cance in his manner, "I have tried all things but <lb/>
one"&#x2014;and waited for her reply. "Try that," <lb/>
she said, and curled her lip in mockery.</p>
<p>That night he rose at midnight and put on his <lb/>
clothes, then said to her,</p>
<p>"Get up and dress!"</p>
<p>She obeyed&#x2014;as always, without a word. He <lb/>
led her half a mile from the house, and proceeded to <lb/>
lash her to a tree by the side of the public road; <lb/>
and succeeded, she screaming and struggling. He <lb/>
gagged her then, struck her across the face with his <lb/>
cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They <lb/>
tore the clothes off her, and she was naked. He <lb/>
called the dogs off, and said:</p>
<p>"You will be found&#x2014;by the passing public. <lb/>
They will be dropping along about three hours <lb/>
from now, and will spread the news&#x2014;do you hear? <lb/>
Good-by. You have seen the last of me."</p>
<p>He went away then. She moaned to herself:</p>
<pb n="296"/>
<p>"I shall bear a child&#x2014;to <i>him!</i> God grant it <lb/>
may be a boy!"</p>
<p>The farmers released her by and by&#x2014;and spread <lb/>
the news, which was natural. They raised the <lb/>
country with lynching intentions, but the bird had <lb/>
flown. The young wife shut herself up in her <lb/>
father's house; he shut himself up with her, and <lb/>
thenceforth would see no one. His pride was <lb/>
broken, and his heart; so he wasted away, day by <lb/>
day, and even his daughter rejoiced when death re- <lb/>
lieved him.</p>
<p>Then she sold the estate and disappeared.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="II">
<pb n="297"/>
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p><smcap>In</smcap> 1886 a young woman was living in a modest <lb/>
house near a secluded New England village, with <lb/>
no company but a little boy about five years old. <lb/>
She did her own work, she discouraged acquaint- <lb/>
anceships, and had none. The butcher, the baker, <lb/>
and the others that served her could tell the villagers <lb/>
nothing about her further than that her name was <lb/>
Stillman, and that she called the child Archy. <lb/>
Whence she came they had not been able to find <lb/>
out, but they said she talked like a Southerner. <lb/>
The child had no playmates and no comrade, and <lb/>
no teacher but the mother. She taught him dili- <lb/>
gently and intelligently, and was satisfied with the <lb/>
results&#x2014;even a little proud of them. One day <lb/>
Archy said,</p>
<p>"Mamma, am I different from other children?"</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose not. Why?"</p>
<p>"There was a child going along out there and <lb/>
asked me if the postman had been by and I said yes, <lb/>
and she said how long since I saw him and I said I <lb/>
hadn't seen him at all, and she said how did I know <lb/>
he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his <lb/>
track on the sidewalk, and she said I was a dum <lb/>
<pb n="298"/>
fool and made a mouth at me. What did she do <lb/>
that for?"</p>
<p>The young woman turned white, and said to her- <lb/>
self, "It's a birthmark! The gift of the blood- <lb/>
hound is in him." She snatched the boy to her <lb/>
breast and hugged him passionately, saying, "God <lb/>
has appointed the way!" Her eyes were burning <lb/>
with a fierce light and her breath came short and <lb/>
quick with excitement. She said to herself: "The <lb/>
puzzle is solved now; many a time it has been a <lb/>
mystery to me, the impossible things the child has <lb/>
done in the dark, but it is all clear to me now."</p>
<p>She set him in his small chair, and said,</p>
<p>"Wait a little till I come, dear; then we will talk <lb/>
about the matter."</p>
<p>She went up to her room and took from her <lb/>
dressing-table several small articles and put them <lb/>
out of sight: a nail-file on the floor under the bed; <lb/>
a pair of nail-scissors under the bureau; a small <lb/>
ivory paper-knife under the wardrobe. Then she <lb/>
returned, and said:</p>
<p>"There! I have left some things which I ought <lb/>
to have brought down." She named them, and <lb/>
said, "Run up and bring them, dear."</p>
<p>The child hurried away on his errand and was soon <lb/>
back again with the things.</p>
<p>"Did you have any difficulty, dear?"</p>
<p>"No, mamma; I only went where you went."</p>
<p>During his absence she had stepped to the book- <lb/>
case, taken several books from the bottom shelf, <lb/>
<pb n="299"/>
opened each, passed her hand over a page, noting its <lb/>
number in her memory, then restored them to their <lb/>
places. Now she said:</p>
<p>"I have been doing something while you have <lb/>
been gone, Archy. Do you think you can find out <lb/>
what it was?"</p>
<p>The boy went to the bookcase and got out the <lb/>
books that had been touched, and opened them at <lb/>
the pages which had been stroked.</p>
<p>The mother took him in her lap, and said:</p>
<p>"I will answer your question now, dear. I have <lb/>
found out that in one way you are quite different <lb/>
from other people. You can see in the dark, you <lb/>
can smell what other people cannot, you have the <lb/>
talents of a bloodhound. They are good and valu- <lb/>
able things to have, but you must keep the matter a <lb/>
secret. If people found it out, they would speak of <lb/>
you as an odd child, a strange child, and children <lb/>
would be disagreeable to you, and give you nick- <lb/>
names. In this world one must be like everybody <lb/>
else if he doesn't want to provoke scorn or envy or <lb/>
jealousy. It is a great and fine distinction which <lb/>
has been born to you, and I am glad; but you will <lb/>
keep it a secret, for mamma's sake, won't you?"</p>
<p>The child promised, without understanding.</p>
<p>All the rest of the day the mother's brain was <lb/>
busy with excited thinkings; with plans, projects, <lb/>
schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and <lb/>
dark. Yet they lit up her face; lit it with a fell <lb/>
light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. <lb/>
<pb n="300"/>
She was in a fever of unrest; she could not sit, <lb/>
stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but in <lb/>
movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty <lb/>
ways, and kept saying to herself all the time, with <lb/>
her mind in the past: "He broke my father's <lb/>
heart, and night and day all these years I have tried, <lb/>
and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I <lb/>
have found it now&#x2014;I have found it now."</p>
<p>When night fell, the demon of unrest still possessed <lb/>
her. She went on with her tests; with a candle she <lb/>
traversed the house from garret to cellar, hiding pins, <lb/>
needles, thimbles, spools, under pillows, under <lb/>
carpets, in cracks in the walls, under the coal in the <lb/>
bin; then sent the little fellow in the dark to find <lb/>
them; which he did, and was happy and proud when <lb/>
she praised him and smothered him with caresses.</p>
<p>From this time forward life took on a new com- <lb/>
plexion for her. She said, "The future is secure&#x2014; <lb/>
I can wait, and enjoy the waiting." The most of <lb/>
her lost interests revived. She took up music again, <lb/>
and languages, drawing, painting, and the other long- <lb/>
discarded delights of her maidenhood. She was <lb/>
happy once more, and felt again the zest of life. <lb/>
As the years drifted by she watched the develop- <lb/>
ment of her boy, and was contented with it. Not <lb/>
altogether, but nearly that. The soft side of his <lb/>
heart was larger than the other side of it. It was <lb/>
his only defect, in her eyes. But she considered <lb/>
that his love for her and worship of her made up for <lb/>
it. He was a good hater&#x2014;that was well; but it <lb/>
<pb n="301"/>
was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of <lb/>
as tough and enduring a quality as those of his <lb/>
friendships&#x2014;and that was not so well.</p>
<p>The years drifted on. Archy was become a hand- <lb/>
some, shapely, athletic youth, courteous, dignified, <lb/>
companionable, pleasant in his ways, and looking <lb/>
perhaps a trifle older than he was, which was sixteen. <lb/>
One evening his mother said she had something of <lb/>
grave importance to say to him, adding that he was <lb/>
old enough to hear it now, and old enough and pos- <lb/>
sessed of character enough and stability enough to <lb/>
carry out a stern plan which she had been for years <lb/>
contriving and maturing. Then she told him her <lb/>
bitter story, in all its naked atrociousness. For a <lb/>
while the boy was paralyzed; then he said:</p>
<p>"I understand. We are Southerners; and by <lb/>
our custom and nature there is but one atonement. <lb/>
I will search him out and kill him."</p>
<p>"Kill him? No! Death is release, emancipa- <lb/>
tion; death is a favor. Do I owe him favors? You <lb/>
must not hurt a hair of his head."</p>
<p>The boy was lost in thought awhile; then he said:</p>
<p>"You are all the world to me, and your desire is <lb/>
my law and my pleasure. Tell me what to do and <lb/>
I will do it."</p>
<p>The mother's eyes beamed with satisfaction, and <lb/>
she said:</p>
<p>"You will go and find him. I have known his <lb/>
hiding-place for eleven years; it cost me five years <lb/>
and more of inquiry, and much money, to locate it. <lb/>
<pb n="302"/>
He is a quartz-miner in Colorado, and well-to-do. <lb/>
He lives in Denver. His name is Jacob Fuller. <lb/>
There&#x2014;it is the first time I have spoken it since <lb/>
that unforgettable night. Think! That name could <lb/>
have been yours if I had not saved you that shame <lb/>
and furnished you a cleaner one. You will drive <lb/>
him from that place; you will hunt him down and <lb/>
drive him again; and yet again, and again, and <lb/>
again, persistently, relentlessly, poisoning his life, <lb/>
filling it with mysterious terrors, loading it with <lb/>
weariness and misery, making him wish for death, <lb/>
and that he had a suicide's courage; you will make <lb/>
of him another wandering Jew; he shall know no <lb/>
rest any more, no peace of mind, no placid sleep; <lb/>
you shall shadow him, cling to him, persecute him, <lb/>
till you break his heart, as he broke my father's and <lb/>
mine."</p>
<p>"I will obey, mother."</p>
<p>"I believe it, my child. The preparations are all <lb/>
made; everything is ready. Here is a letter of <lb/>
credit; spend freely, there is no lack of money. <lb/>
At times you may need disguises. I have provided <lb/>
them; also some other conveniences." She took <lb/>
from the drawer of the typewriter table several <lb/>
squares of paper. They all bore these typewritten <lb/>
words: <lb/>
<q>&#x0024;10,000 REWARD.</q>
<q>It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern State <lb/>
is sojourning here. In 1880, in the night, he tied his young wife to a <lb/>
tree by the public road, cut her across the face with a cowhide, and <lb/>
made his dogs tear her clothes from her, leaving her naked. He left <lb/>
<pb n="303"/>
her there, and fled the country. A blood-relative of hers has searched <lb/>
for him for seventeen years. Address&#x2026;&#x2026;., &#x2026;&#x2026;., Post-office. <lb/>
The above reward will be paid in cash to the person who will furnish <lb/>
the seeker, in a personal interview, the criminal's address.</q></p>
<p>"When you have found him and acquainted your- <lb/>
self with his scent, you will go in the night and <lb/>
placard one of these upon the building he occupies, <lb/>
and another one upon the post-office or in some <lb/>
other prominent place. It will be the talk of the <lb/>
region. At first you must give him several days in <lb/>
which to force a sale of his belongings at something <lb/>
approaching their value. We will ruin him by and <lb/>
by, but gradually; we must not impoverish him at <lb/>
once, for that could bring him to despair and injure <lb/>
his health, possibly kill him."</p>
<p>She took three or four more typewritten forms <lb/>
from the drawer&#x2014;duplicates&#x2014;and read one:</p>

<p>I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob <lb/>
Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions <lb/>
of infantry and find him. I have often been near him and heard him <lb/>
talk. He owns a good mine, and has a fair income from it; but he is <lb/>
not rich. He learned mining in a good way&#x2014;by working at it for <lb/>
wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three years sit lightly <lb/>
upon him; he could pass for a younger man&#x2014;say thirty-six or thirty- <lb/>
seven. He has never married again&#x2014;passes himself off for a widower. <lb/>
He stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel <lb/>
a drawing toward him&#x2014;the paternal blood in me making its claim. <lb/>
How blind and unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature <lb/>
&#x2014;the most of them, in fact! My task is become hard now&#x2014;you <lb/>
realize it? you comprehend, and make allowances?&#x2014;and the fire of it <lb/>
has cooled, more than I like to confess to myself. But I will carry it <lb/>
out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and I will <lb/>
not spare him.</p>
<p>And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect that <lb/>
he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not <lb/>
suffered by it. The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, <lb/>
and in the change he is happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from <lb/>
all suffering; you, the innocent, are borne down with it. But be com- <lb/>
forted&#x2014;he shall harvest his share.</p>

<p>I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I <lb/>
slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave <lb/>
Denver at or before 11.50 the night of the 14th.</p>
<pb n="306"/>
<p>Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted the <lb/>
town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he <lb/>
accomplished what the profession call a "scoop"&#x2014;that is, he got <lb/>
a valuable item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his <lb/>
paper&#x2014;the principal one in the town&#x2014;had it in glaring type on the <lb/>
editorial page in the morning, followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our <lb/>
wretch a column long, which wound up by adding a thousand dollars to <lb/>
our reward on the <i>paper's</i> account! The journals out here know how <lb/>
to do the noble thing&#x2014;when there's business in it.</p>
<p>At breakfast I occupied my usual seat&#x2014;selected because it afforded <lb/>
a view of papa Fuller's face, and was near enough for me to hear the <lb/>
talk that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were <lb/>
in the room, and all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the <lb/>
seeker would find that rascal and remove the pollution of his presence <lb/>
from the town&#x2014;with a rail, or a bullet, or something.</p>
<p>When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave&#x2014;folded up&#x2014;in one <lb/>
hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half <lb/>
a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old <lb/>
and pinched and ashy. And then&#x2014;only think of the things he had to <lb/>
listen to! Mamma, he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him <lb/>
with epithets and characterizations drawn from the very dictionaries and <lb/>
phrase-books of Satan's own authorized editions down below. And <lb/>
more than that, he had to <i>agree</i> with the verdicts and applaud them. <lb/>
His applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise <lb/>
that from me; and it was observable that his appetite was gone; he <lb/>
only nibbled; he couldn't eat. Finally a man said:</p>
<p>"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing what <lb/>
this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so."</p>
<p>Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around <lb/>
scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left.</p>
<p>During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in Mexico, <lb/>
and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give <lb/>
the property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he <lb/>
would take &#x0024;40,000&#x2014;a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that <lb/>
as he greatly needed money on account of his new purchase, he would <lb/>
diminish his terms for cash in full. He sold out for &#x0024;30,000. And <lb/>
then, what do you think he did? He asked for <i>greenbacks</i>, and took <lb/>
them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head <lb/>
full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People <lb/>
<pb n="307"/>
thought it queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks <lb/>
quite conveniently. There was talk of this odd thing, but only for a <lb/>
day; that is as long as any topic lasts in Denver.</p>
<p>I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed and <lb/>
the money paid&#x2014;which was on the 11th&#x2014;I began to stick to Fuller's <lb/>
track without dropping it for a moment. That night&#x2014;no, 12th, for it <lb/>
was a little past midnight&#x2014;I tracked him to his room, which was four <lb/>
doors from mine in the same hall; then I went back and put on my <lb/>
muddy day-laborer disguise, darkened my complexion, and sat down <lb/>
in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy, with a change in it, <lb/>
and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing now. <lb/>
In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the <lb/>
familiar whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left <lb/>
the hotel by a side entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfre- <lb/>
quented street and walked three blocks in a light rain and a heavy dark- <lb/>
ness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of course was waiting for <lb/>
him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk platform <lb/>
behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack <lb/>
stopped at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took <lb/>
a seat on a barrow under the awning, as far as he could get from the <lb/>
light; I went inside, and watched the ticket-office. Fuller bought no <lb/>
ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came along, and he boarded <lb/>
a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down the aisle <lb/>
and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named <lb/>
his objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor <lb/>
was changing a bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place <lb/>
&#x2014;about a hundred miles westward.</p>
<p>From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled <lb/>
here and there and yonder&#x2014;always on a general westward trend&#x2014; <lb/>
but he was not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like my- <lb/>
self, and wore bushy false whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he <lb/>
could do the character without thinking about it, for he had served the <lb/>
trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have recognized him. <lb/>
At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp in <lb/>
Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all <lb/>
day, and avoids society. I am living at a miner's boarding-house, and <lb/>
it is an awful place: the bunks, the food, the dirt&#x2014;everything.</p>
<p>We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but <lb/>
once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as <lb/>
<pb n="308"/>
he engaged a shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and tele- <lb/>
graphed that Denver hotel to keep my baggage till I should send for it. <lb/>
I need nothing here but a change of army shirts, and I brought that <lb/>
with me.</p>

<p>The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know <lb/>
the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least <lb/>
in my hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. <lb/>
He has located a claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in <lb/>
the mountains; it promises very well, and he is working it diligently. <lb/>
Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles, and he keeps quite <lb/>
to himself, consorting with no one&#x2014;he who was so fond of company <lb/>
and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along <lb/>
several times recently&#x2014;drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his <lb/>
step, a pathetic figure. He calls himself David Wilson.</p>
<p>I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you <lb/>
insist, I will banish him again, but I do not see how he can be unhap- <lb/>
pier than he already is. I will go back to Denver and treat myself to a <lb/>
little season of comfort, and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily <lb/>
decency; then I will fetch my things, and notify poor papa Wilson <lb/>
to move on.</p>

<p><i>This</i> Jacob Fuller is a <i>cousin</i> of the guilty one. How stupid we <lb/>

aged twenty-one&#x2014;a year before you were married; and the documents <lb/>
<pb n="309"/>
to prove it are innumerable. Last night I talked with familiar friends <lb/>
of his who have known him from the day of his arrival. I said nothing, <lb/>
but a few days from now I will land him in this town again, with the <lb/>

torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody <lb/>

<p>Mother, he is gone! Gone, and left no trace. The scent was cold <lb/>
when I came. To-day I am out of bed for the first time since. I wish <lb/>
I were not a boy; then I could stand shocks better. They all think he <lb/>
went west. I start to-night, in a wagon&#x2014;two or three hours of that, <lb/>
then I get a train. I don't know where I'm going, but I must go; to <lb/>
try to keep still would be torture.</p>
<p>Of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise. <lb/>
This means that <i>I may have to search the whole globe to find him</i>. In- <lb/>
deed it is what I expect. Do you see, mother? It is <i>I</i> that am the <lb/>
Wandering Jew. The irony of it! We arranged that for another.</p>
<p>Think of the difficulties! And there would be none if I only could <lb/>
advertise for him. But if there is any way to do it that would not <lb/>
frighten him, I have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till <lb/>
my brains are addled. "If the gentleman who lately bought a mine in <lb/>
Mexico and sold one in Denver will send his address to" (to whom, <lb/>
mother!), "it will be explained to him that it was all a mistake; his <lb/>
forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he <lb/>
sustained in a certain matter." Do you see? He would think it a <lb/>
trap. Well, any one would. If I should say, "It is now known that <lb/>
he was not the man wanted, but another man&#x2014;a man who once bore <lb/>
the same name, but discarded it for good reasons"&#x2014;would that <lb/>
answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say "Oho!" <lb/>
and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, <lb/>
"Why did he run away if he wasn't the right man?&#x2014;it is too thin." <lb/>
If I failed to find him he would be ruined there&#x2014;there where there is <lb/>
no taint upon him now. You have a better head than mine. Help me.</p>
<p>I have one clew, and only one. I know his handwriting. If he puts <lb/>
his new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too <lb/>
much, it will be valuable to me if I ever run across it.</p>

<p>You already know how well I have searched the States from Colorado <lb/>
to the Pacific, and how nearly I came to getting him once. Well, I <lb/>
have had another close miss. It was here, yesterday. I struck his <lb/>
trail, <i>hot</i>, on the street, and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel. That <lb/>
was a costly mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But <lb/>
I am only part dog, and can get very humanly stupid when excited. <lb/>
He had been stopping in that house ten days; I almost know, now, <lb/>
that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is rest- <lb/>
less and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know <lb/>
what it is to feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when <lb/>
I came so near catching him nine months ago&#x2014;"James Walker"; <lb/>
doubtless the same he adopted when he fled from Silver Gulch. An <lb/>
unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I recognized <lb/>
the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not <lb/>
good at shams and pretenses.</p>
<p>They said he was just gone, on a journey; left no address; didn't <lb/>
say where he was going; looked frightened when asked to leave his <lb/>
address; had no baggage but a cheap valise; carried it off on foot&#x2014;a <lb/>
"stingy old person, and not much loss to the house." "<i>Old!</i>" I <lb/>
suppose he is, now. I hardly heard; I was there but a moment. I <lb/>
rushed along his trail, and it led me to a wharf. Mother, the smoke of <lb/>
the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the horizon! I should <lb/>
have saved half an hour if I had gone in the right direction at first. I <lb/>
could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching <lb/>
that vessel. She is bound for Melbourne.</p>

<p>You have a right to complain. "A letter a year" <i>is</i> a paucity; I <lb/>
freely acknowledge it; but how can one write when there is nothing to <lb/>
write about but failures? No one can keep it up; it breaks the heart.</p>
<p>I told you&#x2014;it seems ages ago, now&#x2014;how I missed him at Mel- <lb/>
bourne, and then chased him all over Australasia for months on end.</p>
<p>Well, then, after that I followed him to India; almost <i>saw</i> him in <lb/>
Bombay; traced him all around&#x2014;to Baroda, Rawal-Pindi, Lucknow, <lb/>
Lahore, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Madras&#x2014;oh, everywhere; <lb/>
week after week, month after month, through the dust and swelter&#x2014; <lb/>
always approximately on his track, sometimes close upon him, yet never <lb/>
catching him. And down to Ceylon, and then to&#x2014; Never mind; <lb/>
by and by I will write it all out.</p>
<pb n="311"/>
<p>I chased him home to California, and down to Mexico, and back <lb/>
again to California. Since then I have been hunting him about the <lb/>
State from the first of last January down to a month ago. I feel almost <lb/>
sure he is not far from Hope Canyon; I traced him to a point thirty <lb/>
miles from here, but there I lost the trail; some one gave him a lift in a <lb/>
wagon, I suppose.</p>
<p>I am taking a rest, now&#x2014;modified by searchings for the lost trail. I <lb/>
was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming un- <lb/>
comfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are <lb/>
good fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their <lb/>
breezy ways freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I <lb/>
have been here a month. I am cabining with a young fellow named <lb/>
"Sammy" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son of his mother&#x2014; <lb/>
like me&#x2014;and loves her dearly, and writes to her every week&#x2014;part of <lb/>
which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of intellect&#x2014; <lb/>
well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no matter, he <lb/>
is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and <lb/>
luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish <lb/>
"James Walker" could have it. He had friends; he liked company. <lb/>
That brings up that picture of him, the time that I saw him last. The <lb/>
pathos of it! It comes before me often and often. At that very time, <lb/>
poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on again!</p>
<p>Hillyer's heart is better than mine, better than anybody's in the com- <lb/>
munity, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the <lb/>
camp&#x2014;Flint Buckner&#x2014;and the only man Flint ever talks with or <lb/>
allows to talk with him. He says he knows Flint's history, and that it <lb/>
is trouble that has made him what he is, and so one ought to be as chari- <lb/>
table toward him as one can. Now none but a pretty large heart could <lb/>
find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint Buckner, from all I hear <lb/>
about him outside. I think that this one detail will give you a better <lb/>
idea of Sammy's character than any labored-out description I could <lb/>
furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like <lb/>
this: "Flint is a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to <lb/>
me&#x2014;empties his breast from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. <lb/>
There couldn't be any unhappier man, Archy Stillman; his life has <lb/>
been made up of misery of mind&#x2014;he isn't near as old as he looks. <lb/>
He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace&#x2014;oh, years and years <lb/>
ago! He doesn't know what good luck is&#x2014;never has had any; often <lb/>
says he wishes he was in the other hell, he is so tired of this one."</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of the Republican:</i>&#x2014;</p>
<p>One of your citizens has asked me a question about the "&#x0153;sopha- <lb/>
gus," and I wish to answer him through you. This in the hope that the <lb/>
answer will get around, and save me some penmanship, for I have <lb/>
already replied to the same question more than several times, and am <lb/>
not getting as much holiday as I ought to have.</p>
<p>I published a short story lately, and it was in that that I put the <lb/>
&#x0153;sophagus. I will say privately that I expected it to bother some peo- <lb/>
ple&#x2014;in fact, that was the intention,&#x2014;but the harvest has been larger <lb/>
than I was calculating upon. The &#x0153;sophagus has gathered in the <lb/>
guilty and the innocent alike, whereas I was only fishing for the inno- <lb/>
cent&#x2014;the innocent and confiding. I knew a few of these would write <lb/>
and ask me; that would give me but little trouble; but I was not ex- <lb/>
pecting that the wise and the learned would call upon me for succor. <lb/>
However, that has happened, and it is time for me to speak up and <lb/>
stop the inquiries if I can, for letter-writing is not restful to me, and I <lb/>
am not having so much fun out of this thing as I counted on. That <lb/>
you may understand the situation, I will insert a couple of sample in- <lb/>
quiries. The first is from a public instructor in the Philippines:</p>

<p>My Dear Sir: I have just been reading the first part of your latest <lb/>
story, entitled "A Double-barreled Detective Story," and am very much <lb/>
delighted with it. In Part IV, page 264, Harper's Magazine for Janu- <lb/>
ary, occurs this passage: "far in the empty sky a solitary '&#x0153;sophagus' <lb/>
slept, upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and <lb/>
the peace of God." Now, there is one word I do not understand, <lb/>
namely, "&#x0153;sophagus." My only work of reference is the "Standard <lb/>
Dictionary," but that fails to explain the meaning. If you can spare <lb/>
the time, I would be glad to have the meaning cleared up, as I consider <lb/>
the passage a very touching and beautiful one. It may seem foolish to <lb/>
you, but consider my lack of means away out in the northern part of <lb/>
Luzon.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Yours very truly.</salute>

<quotedLetter>
<p>Do you notice? Nothing in the paragraph disturbed him but that <lb/>
one word. It shows that that paragraph was most ably constructed for <lb/>
the deception it was intended to put upon the reader. It was my inten- <lb/>
tion that it should read plausibly, and it is now plain that it does; it was <lb/>
my intention that it should be emotional and touching, and you see, <lb/>
yourself, that it fetched this public instructor. Alas, if I had but left <lb/>
that one treacherous word out, I should have scored! scored every- <lb/>
where; and the paragraph would have slidden through every reader's <lb/>
sensibilities like oil, and left not a suspicion behind.</p>
<p>The other sample inquiry is from a professor in a New England uni- <lb/>
versity. It contains one naughty word (which I cannot bear to sup- <lb/>
press), but he is not in the theological department, so it is no harm:&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Clemens: "Far in the empty sky a solitary &#x0153;sophagus <lb/>
slept upon motionless wing."</p>
<p>It is not often I get a chance to read much periodical literature, but <lb/>
I have just gone through at this belated period, with much gratification <lb/>
and edification, your "Double-Barreled Detective Story."</p>
<p>But what in hell is an &#x0153;sophagus? I keep one myself, but it never <lb/>
sleeps in the air or anywhere else. My profession is to deal with words, <lb/>
and &#x0153;sophagus interested me the moment I lighted upon it. But as a <lb/>
companion of my youth used to say, "I'll be eternally, co-eternally <lb/>
cussed" if I can make it out. Is it a joke, or I an ignoramus?</p>
<p>Between you and me, I was almost ashamed of having fooled that <lb/>
man, but for pride's sake I was not going to say so. I wrote and told <lb/>
him it was a joke&#x2014;and that is what I am now saying to my Springfield <lb/>
inquirer. And I told him to carefully read the whole paragraph, and <lb/>
he would find not a vestige of sense in any detail of it. This also I <lb/>
commend to my Springfield inquirer.</p>
<p>I have confessed. I am sorry&#x2014;partially. I will not do so any <lb/>
more&#x2014;for the present. Don't ask me any more questions; let the <lb/>
&#x0153;sophagus have a rest&#x2014;on his same old motionless wing.</p>

<p>(Editorial.)</p>
<p><gap desc="image" reason="editorial"/> The "Double-Barreled Detective Story," which appeared in Har- <lb/>
per's Mag. for January and February last, is the most elaborate of bur- <lb/>
lesques on detective fiction, with striking melodramatic passages in which <lb/>
it is difficult to detect the deception, so ably is it done. But the illusion <lb/>
ought not to endure even the first incident in the February number. <lb/>
As for the paragraph which has so admirably illustrated the skill of Mr. <lb/>
Clemens's ensemble and the carelessness of readers, here it is:&#x2014;</p>
<p>It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and <lb/>
laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing <lb/>
in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for the wingless <lb/>
wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit to- <lb/>
gether; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow <lb/>
flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the wood- <lb/>
land; the sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose <lb/>
upon the swooning atmosphere; far in the empty sky a solitary &#x0153;so- <lb/>
phagus slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness, <lb/>
serenity, and the peace of God.</p>
<p>The success of Mark Twain's joke recalls to mind his story of the <lb/>
petrified man in the cavern, whom he described most punctiliously, first <lb/>
giving a picture of the scene, its impressive solitude, and all that; then <lb/>
going on to describe the majesty of the figure, casually mentioning <lb/>
that the thumb of his right hand rested against the side of his nose; <lb/>
then after further description observing that the fingers of the right <lb/>
hand were extended in a radiating fashion; and, recurring to the digni- <lb/>
fied attitude and position of the man, incidentally remarked that the <lb/>
thumb of the left hand was in contact with the little finger of the right <lb/>
&#x2014;and so on. But it was so ingeniously written that Mark, relating the <lb/>
history years later in an article which appeared in that excellent maga- <lb/>
zine of the past, the Galaxy, declared that no one ever found out the <lb/>
joke, and, if we remember aright, that that astonishing old mockery <lb/>
was actually looked for in the region where he, as a Nevada newspaper <lb/>
editor, had located it. It is certain that Mark Twain's jumping frog <lb/>
has a good many more "pints" than any other frog.</p></note> slept upon motionless wing; every- <lb/>
<pb n="313"/>
where brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of <lb/>
God.</p>
<p>October is the time&#x2014;1900; Hope Canyon is the <lb/>
place, a silver-mining camp away down in the <lb/>
<pb n="314"/>
Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and <lb/>
remote; recent as to discovery; thought by its oc- <lb/>
cupants to be rich in metal&#x2014;a year or two's pros- <lb/>
pecting will decide that matter one way or the <lb/>
<pb n="315"/>
other. For inhabitants, the camp has about two <lb/>
hundred miners, one white woman and child, <lb/>
several Chinese washermen, five squaws, and a <lb/>
dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, <lb/>
battered plug hats, and tin-can necklaces. There are <lb/>
no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The <lb/>
camp has existed but two years; it has made no big <lb/>
strike; the world is ignorant of its name and place.</p>
<p>On both sides of the canyon the mountains rise <lb/>
wall-like, three thousand feet, and the long spiral of <lb/>
straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a <lb/>
kiss from the sun only once a day, when he sails <lb/>
over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long; <lb/>
<pb n="316"/>
the cabins stand well apart from each other. The <lb/>
tavern is the only "frame" house&#x2014;the only house, <lb/>
one might say. It occupies a central position, and <lb/>
is the evening resort of the population. They drink <lb/>
there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also bil- <lb/>
liards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn <lb/>
places repaired with court-plaster; there are some <lb/>
cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which <lb/>
clatter when they run, and do not slow up gradually, <lb/>
but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a part of a <lb/>
cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; <lb/>
and the man who can score six on a single break <lb/>
can set up the drinks at the bar's expense.</p>
<p>Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the vil- <lb/>
lage, going south; his silver claim was at the other <lb/>
end of the village, northward, and a little beyond <lb/>
the last hut in that direction. He was a sour <lb/>
creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. <lb/>
People who had tried to get acquainted with him <lb/>
had regretted it and dropped him. His history was <lb/>
not known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer <lb/>
knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said no, <lb/>
he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek <lb/>
English youth of sixteen or seventeen with him, <lb/>
whom he treated roughly, both in public and in <lb/>
private; and of course this lad was applied to for <lb/>
information, but with no success. Fetlock Jones&#x2014; <lb/>
name of the youth&#x2014;said that Flint picked him up <lb/>
on a prospecting tramp, and as he had neither home <lb/>
nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay <lb/>
<pb n="317"/>
and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the <lb/>
salary, which was bacon and beans. Further than <lb/>
this he could offer no testimony.</p>
<p>Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, <lb/>
and under his meek exterior he was slowly consum- <lb/>
ing to a cinder with the insults and humiliations <lb/>
which his master had put upon him. For the meek <lb/>
suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, per- <lb/>
haps, than do the manlier sort, who can burst out <lb/>
and get relief with words or blows when the limit of <lb/>
endurance has been reached. Good-hearted people <lb/>
wanted to help Fetlock out of his trouble, and tried <lb/>
to get him to leave Buckner; but the boy showed <lb/>
fright at the thought, and said he "dasn't." Pat <lb/>
Riley urged him, and said:</p>
<p>"You leave the damned hunks and come with <lb/>
me; don't you be afraid. I'll take care of <i>him</i>."</p>
<p>The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes, but <lb/>
shuddered and said he "dasn't risk it"; he said <lb/>
Flint would catch him alone, some time, in the <lb/>
night, and then&#x2014; "Oh, it makes me sick, Mr. <lb/>
Riley, to think of it."</p>
<p>Others said, "Run away from him; we'll stake <lb/>
you; skip out for the coast some night." But all <lb/>
these suggestions failed; he said Flint would hunt <lb/>
him down and fetch him back, just for meanness.</p>
<p>The people could not understand this. The boy's <lb/>
miseries went steadily on, week after week. It is <lb/>
quite likely that the people would have understood <lb/>
if they had known how he was employing his spare <lb/>
<pb n="318"/>
time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flint's; and <lb/>
there, nights, he nursed his bruises and his humilia- <lb/>
tions, and studied and studied over a single problem <lb/>
&#x2014;how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be <lb/>
found out. It was the only joy he had in life; <lb/>
these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four <lb/>
which he looked forward to with eagerness and <lb/>
spent in happiness.</p>
<p>He thought of poison. No&#x2014;that would not <lb/>
serve; the inquest would reveal where it was pro- <lb/>
cured and who had procured it. He thought of a <lb/>
shot in the back in a lonely place when Flint would <lb/>
be homeward bound at midnight&#x2014;his unvarying <lb/>
hour for the trip. No&#x2014;somebody might be near, <lb/>
and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his <lb/>
sleep. No&#x2014;he might strike an inefficient blow, <lb/>
and Flint would seize him. He examined a hundred <lb/>
different ways&#x2014;none of them would answer; for in <lb/>
even the very obscurest and secretest of them there <lb/>
was always the fatal defect of a <i>risk</i>, a chance, a <lb/>
possibility that he might be found out. He would <lb/>
have none of that.</p>
<p>But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was <lb/>
no hurry, he said to himself. He would never leave <lb/>
Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry <lb/>
&#x2014;he would find the way. It was somewhere, and <lb/>
he would endure shame and pain and misery until he <lb/>
found it. Yes, somewhere there was a way which <lb/>
would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clew to <lb/>
the murderer&#x2014;there was no hurry&#x2014;he would find <lb/>
<pb n="319"/>
that way, and then&#x2014;oh, then, it would just be <lb/>
good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently <lb/>
keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as <lb/>
always theretofore, he would allow no one to hear <lb/>
him say a resentful or offensive thing about his <lb/>
oppressor.</p>
<p>Two days before the before-mentioned October <lb/>
morning Flint had bought some things, and he and <lb/>
Fetlock had brought them home to Flint's cabin: a <lb/>
fresh box of candles, which they put in the corner; <lb/>
a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon <lb/>
the candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which <lb/>
they placed under Flint's bunk; a huge coil of fuse, <lb/>
which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that <lb/>
Flint's mining operations had outgrown the pick, <lb/>
and that blasting was about to begin now. He had <lb/>
seen blasting done, and he had a notion of the pro- <lb/>
cess, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture <lb/>
was right&#x2014;blasting-time had come. In the morn- <lb/>
ing the pair carried fuse, drills, and the powder-can <lb/>
to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to <lb/>
get into it and out of it a short ladder was used. <lb/>
They descended, and by command Fetlock held the <lb/>
drill&#x2014;without any instructions as to the right way <lb/>
to hold it&#x2014;and Flint proceeded to strike. The <lb/>
sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlock's <lb/>
hand, almost as a matter of course.</p>
<p>"You mangy son of a nigger, is that any way to <lb/>
hold a drill? Pick it up! Stand it up! There&#x2014; <lb/>
hold fast. D<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing"/> you! <i>I'll</i> teach you!"</p>
<pb n="320"/>
<p>At the end of an hour the drilling was finished.</p>
<p>"Now, then, charge it."</p>
<p>The boy started to pour in the powder.</p>
<p>"Idiot!"</p>
<p>A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out.</p>
<p>"Get up! You can't lie sniveling there. Now, <lb/>
then, stick in the fuse <i>first. Now</i> put in the <lb/>
powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you going to fill <lb/>
the hole <i>all</i> up? Of all the sap-headed milksops I <lb/>
&#x2014; Put in some dirt! Put in some gravel! Tamp <lb/>
it down! Hold on, hold on! Oh, great Scott! <lb/>
get out of the way!" He snatched the iron and <lb/>
tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and <lb/>
blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, <lb/>
climbed out of the shaft, and ran fifty yards away, <lb/>
Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few min- <lb/>
utes, then a great volume of smoke and rocks burst <lb/>
high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after <lb/>
a little there was a shower of descending stones; <lb/>
then all was serene again.</p>
<p>"I wish to God you'd been in it!" remarked the <lb/>
master.</p>
<p>They went down the shaft, cleaned it out, drilled <lb/>
another hole, and put in another charge.</p>
<p>"Look here! How much fuse are you proposing <lb/>
to waste? Don't you know how to time a fuse?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"You <i>don't!</i> Well, if you don't beat anything <i>I</i> <lb/>
ever saw!"</p>
<p>He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down:</p>
<pb n="321"/>
<p>"Well, idiot, are you going to be all day? Cut <lb/>
the fuse and light it!"</p>
<p>The trembling creature began,</p>
<p>"If you please, sir, I&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"You talk back to <i>me?</i> Cut it and light it!"</p>
<p>The boy cut and lit.</p>
<p>"Ger-reat Scott! a one-minute fuse! I wish you <lb/>
were in&#x2014;"</p>
<p>In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft <lb/>
and ran. The boy was aghast.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God! Help! Help! Oh, save me!" <lb/>
he implored. "Oh, what can I do! What <i>can</i> <lb/>
I do!"</p>
<p>He backed against the wall as tightly as he could; <lb/>
the sputtering fuse frightened the voice out of him; <lb/>
his breath stood still; he stood gazing and impotent; <lb/>
in two seconds, three seconds, four he would be fly- <lb/>
ing toward the sky torn to fragments. Then he had <lb/>
an inspiration. He sprang at the fuse; severed the <lb/>
inch of it that was left above ground, and was saved.</p>
<p>He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright, <lb/>
his strength gone; but he muttered with a deep joy:</p>
<p>"He has learnt me! I knew there was a way, if <lb/>
I would wait."</p>
<p>After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the <lb/>
shaft, looking worried and uneasy, and peered down <lb/>
into it. He took in the situation; he saw what had <lb/>
happened. He lowered the ladder, and the boy <lb/>
dragged himself weakly up it. He was very white. <lb/>
His appearance added something to Buckner's un- <lb/>
<pb n="322"/>
comfortable state, and he said, with a show of regret <lb/>
and sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from <lb/>
lack of practice:</p>
<p>"It was an accident, you know. Don't say any- <lb/>
thing about it to anybody; I was excited, and didn't <lb/>
notice what I was doing. You're not looking well; <lb/>
you've worked enough for to-day; go down to my <lb/>
cabin and eat what you want, and rest. It's just an <lb/>
accident, you know, on account of my being <lb/>
excited."</p>
<p>"It scared me," said the lad, as he started away; <lb/>
"but I learnt something, so I don't mind it."</p>
<p>"Damned easy to please!" muttered Buckner, <lb/>
following him with his eye. "I wonder if he'll tell? <lb/>
Mightn't he? &#x2026; I wish it <i>had</i> killed him."</p>
<p>The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the <lb/>
matter of resting; he employed it in work, eager <lb/>
and feverish and happy work. A thick growth of <lb/>
chaparral extended down the mountain-side clear to <lb/>
Flint's cabin; the most of Fetlock's labor was done <lb/>
in the dark intricacies of that stubborn growth; the <lb/>
rest of it was done in his own shanty. At last all <lb/>
was complete, and he said:</p>
<p>"If he's got any suspicions that I'm going to tell <lb/>
on him, he won't keep them long, to-morrow. He <lb/>
will see that I am the same milksop as I always was <lb/>
&#x2014;all day and the next. And the day after to-mor- <lb/>
row night there'll be an end of him; nobody will <lb/>
ever guess who finished him up nor how it was done. <lb/>
He dropped me the idea his own self, and that's odd."</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> next day came and went.</p>
<p>It is now almost midnight, and in five min- <lb/>
utes the new morning will begin. The scene is in <lb/>
the tavern billiard-room. Rough men in rough <lb/>
clothing, slouch hats, breeches stuffed into boot- <lb/>
tops, some with vests, none with coats, are grouped <lb/>
about the boiler-iron stove, which has ruddy cheeks <lb/>
and is distributing a grateful warmth; the billiard <lb/>
balls are clacking; there is no other sound&#x2014;that is, <lb/>
within; the wind is fitfully moaning without. The <lb/>
men look bored; also expectant. A hulking, broad- <lb/>
shouldered miner, of middle age, with grizzled whis- <lb/>
kers, and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face, <lb/>
rises, slips a coil of fuse upon his arm, gathers up <lb/>
some other personal properties, and departs without <lb/>
word or greeting to anybody. It is Flint Buckner. As <lb/>
the door closes behind him a buzz of talk breaks out.</p>
<p>"The regularest man that ever was," said Jake <lb/>
Parker, the blacksmith: "you can tell when it's <lb/>
twelve just by him leaving, without looking at your <lb/>
Waterbury."</p>
<p>"And it's the only virtue he's got, as fur as I <lb/>
know," said Peter Hawes, miner.</p>
<pb n="324"/>
<p>"He's just a blight on this society," said Wells- <lb/>
Fargo's man, Ferguson. "If I was running this <lb/>
shop I'd make him say something, <i>some</i> time or <lb/>
other, or vamos the ranch." This with a suggestive <lb/>
glance at the barkeeper, who did not choose to see <lb/>
it, since the man under discussion was a good cus- <lb/>
tomer, and went home pretty well set up, every <lb/>
night, with refreshments furnished from the bar.</p>
<p>"Say," said Ham Sandwich, miner, "does any <lb/>
of you boys ever recollect of him asking you to take <lb/>
a drink?"</p>
<p>"<i>Him?</i> Flint <i>Buckner?</i> Oh, Laura!"</p>
<p>This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous <lb/>
general outburst in one form of words or another <lb/>
from the crowd. After a brief silence, Pat Riley, <lb/>
miner, said:</p>
<p>"He's the 15-puzzle, that cuss. And his boy's <lb/>
another one. <i>I</i> can't make them out."</p>
<p>"Nor anybody else," said Ham Sandwich; "and <lb/>
if they are 15-puzzles, how are you going to rank <lb/>
up that other one? When it comes to A 1 right- <lb/>
down solid mysteriousness, he lays over both of <lb/>
them. <i>Easy</i>&#x2014;don't he?"</p>
<p>"You bet!"</p>
<p>Everybody said it. Every man but one. He <lb/>
was the new-comer&#x2014;Peterson. He ordered the <lb/>
drinks all round, and asked who No. 3 might be. <lb/>
All answered at once, "Archy Stillman!"</p>
<p>"Is he a mystery?" asked Peterson.</p>
<p>"Is <i>he</i> a mystery? Is Archy <i>Stillman</i> a mys- <lb/>
<pb n="325"/>
tery?" said Wells-Fargo's man, Ferguson. "Why, <lb/>
the fourth dimension's foolishness to <i>him</i>."</p>
<p>For Ferguson was learned.</p>
<p>Peterson wanted to hear all about him; everybody <lb/>
wanted to tell him; everybody began. But Billy <lb/>
Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, <lb/>
and said one at a time was best. He distributed the <lb/>
drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"Well, he's a boy. And that is just about all we <lb/>
know about him. You can pump him till you are <lb/>
tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything. <lb/>
At least about his intentions, or line of business, <lb/>
or where he's from, and such things as that. And <lb/>
as for getting at the nature and get-up of his main <lb/>
big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject, <lb/>
that's all. You can <i>guess</i> till you're black in the face <lb/>
&#x2014;it's your privilege&#x2014;but suppose you do, where do <lb/>
you arrive at? Nowhere, as near as I can make out."</p>
<p>"What <i>is</i> his big chief one?"</p>
<p>"Sight, maybe. Hearing, maybe. Instinct, <lb/>
maybe. Magic, maybe. Take your choice&#x2014; <lb/>
grown-ups, twenty-five; children and servants, half <lb/>
price. Now I'll tell you what he can do. You can <lb/>
start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide <lb/>
wherever you want to, I don't care where it is, <lb/>
nor how far&#x2014;and he'll go straight and put his <lb/>
finger on you."</p>
<p>"You don't mean it!"</p>
<p>"I just do, though. Weather's nothing to him&#x2014; <lb/>
<pb n="326"/>
elemental conditions is nothing to him&#x2014;he don't <lb/>
even take notice of them."</p>
<p>"Oh, come! Dark? Rain? Snow? Hey?"</p>
<p>"It's all the same to <i>him</i>. He don't give a <lb/>
damn."</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>say</i>&#x2014;including <i>fog</i>, per'aps?"</p>
<p>"<i>Fog!</i> he's got an eye 't can plunk through it <lb/>
like a bullet."</p>
<p>"Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?"</p>
<p>"It's a fact!" they all shouted. "Go on, <lb/>
Wells-Fargo."</p>
<p>"Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with <lb/>
the boys, and you can slip out and go to any cabin <lb/>
in this camp and open a book&#x2014;yes, sir, a dozen of <lb/>
them&#x2014;and take the page in your memory, and <lb/>
he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open <lb/>
every one of them books at the right page, and call <lb/>
it off, and never make a mistake."</p>
<p>"He must be the devil!"</p>
<p>"More than one has thought it. Now I'll tell <lb/>
you a perfectly wonderful thing that he done. The <lb/>
other night he&#x2014;"</p>
<p>There was a sudden great murmur of sounds out- <lb/>
side, the door flew open, and an excited crowd burst <lb/>
in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead <lb/>
and crying:</p>
<p>"My child! my child! she's lost and gone! For <lb/>
the love of God help me to find Archy Stillman; <lb/>
we've hunted everywhere!"</p>
<p>Said the barkeeper:</p>
<pb n="327"/>
<p>"Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't <lb/>
worry. He asked for a bed three hours ago, tuck- <lb/>
ered out tramping the trails the way he's always do- <lb/>
ing, and went upstairs. Ham Sandwich, run up <lb/>
and roust him out; he's in No. 14."</p>
<p>The youth was soon downstairs and ready. He <lb/>
asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars.</p>
<p>"Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there <lb/>
was. I put her to sleep at seven in the evening, <lb/>
and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed <lb/>
myself, she was gone. I rushed for your cabin, <lb/>
dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you <lb/>
ever since, at every cabin down the gulch, and now <lb/>
I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and <lb/>
scared and heart-broke; but, thanks to God, I've <lb/>
found you at last, dear heart, and you'll find my <lb/>
child. Come on! come quick!"</p>
<p>"Move right along; I'm with you, madam. Go <lb/>
to your cabin first."</p>
<p>The whole company streamed out to join the <lb/>
hunt. All the southern half of the village was up, <lb/>
a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague <lb/>
dark mass sprinkled with twinkling lanterns. The <lb/>
mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accom- <lb/>
modate itself to the narrow road, and strode briskly <lb/>
along southward in the wake of the leaders. In a <lb/>
few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached.</p>
<p>"There's the bunk," said Mrs. Hogan; "there's <lb/>
where she was; it's where I laid her at seven <lb/>
o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows."</p>
<pb n="328"/>
<p>"Hand me a lantern," said Archy. He set it <lb/>
on the hard earth floor and knelt by it, pretending <lb/>
to examine the ground closely. "Here's her <lb/>
track," he said, touching the ground here and there <lb/>
and yonder with his finger. "Do you see?"</p>
<p>Several of the company dropped upon their knees <lb/>
and did their best to see. One or two thought they <lb/>
discerned something like a track; the others shook <lb/>
their heads and confessed that the smooth hard <lb/>
surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were <lb/>
sharp enough to discover. One said, "Maybe a <lb/>
child's foot could make a mark on it, but <i>I</i> don't <lb/>
see how."</p>
<p>Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to <lb/>
the ground, turned leftward, and moved three steps, <lb/>
closely examining; then said, "I've got the direc- <lb/>
tion&#x2014;come along; take the lantern, somebody."</p>
<p>He strode off swiftly southward, the files follow- <lb/>
ing, swaying and bending in and out with the deep <lb/>
curves of the gorge. Thus a mile, and the mouth <lb/>
of the gorge was reached; before them stretched <lb/>
the sage-brush plain, dim, vast, and vague. Still- <lb/>
man called a halt, saying, "We mustn't start wrong, <lb/>
now; we must take the direction again."</p>
<p>He took a lantern and examined the ground for a <lb/>
matter of twenty yards; then said, "Come on; it's all <lb/>
right," and gave up the lantern. In and out among <lb/>
the sage-bushes he marched, a quarter of a mile, bear- <lb/>
ing gradually to the right; then took a new direction <lb/>
and made another great semicircle; then changed <lb/>
<pb n="329"/>
again and moved due west nearly half a mile&#x2014;and <lb/>
stopped.</p>
<p>"She gave it up, here, poor little chap. Hold the <lb/>
lantern. You can see where she sat."</p>
<p>But this was in a slick alkali flat which was sur- <lb/>
faced like steel, and no person in the party was <lb/>
quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could <lb/>
detect the track of a cushion on a veneer like that. <lb/>
The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed <lb/>
the spot, lamenting.</p>
<p>"But where is she, then?" some one said. "She <lb/>
didn't stay here. We can see <i>that</i> much, anyway."</p>
<p>Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, <lb/>
with the lantern, pretending to hunt for tracks.</p>
<p>"Well!" he said presently, in an annoyed tone, <lb/>
"I don't understand it." He examined again. <lb/>
"No use. She was here&#x2014;that's certain; she <lb/>
never <i>walked</i> away from here&#x2014;and that's certain. <lb/>
It's a puzzle; I can't make it out."</p>
<p>The mother lost heart then.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God! oh, blessed Virgin! some flying <lb/>
beast has got her. I'll never see her again!"</p>
<p>"Ah, <i>don't</i> give up," said Archy. "We'll find <lb/>
her&#x2014;don't give up."</p>
<p>"God bless you for the words, Archy Stillman!" <lb/>
and she seized his hand and kissed it fervently.</p>
<p>Peterson, the new-comer, whispered satirically in <lb/>
Ferguson's ear:</p>
<p>"Wonderful performance to find this place, <lb/>
wasn't it? Hardly worth while to come so far, <lb/>
<pb n="330"/>
though; any other supposititious place would have <lb/>
answered just as well&#x2014;hey?"</p>
<p>Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo. He <lb/>
said, with some warmth:</p>
<p>"Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasn't <lb/>
been here? I tell you the child <i>has</i> been here! <lb/>
Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a <lb/>
little fuss as&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"All right!" sang out Stillman. "Come, every- <lb/>
body, and look at this! It was right under our <lb/>
noses all the time, and we didn't see it."</p>
<p>There was a general plunge for the ground at the <lb/>
place where the child was alleged to have rested, <lb/>
and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the <lb/>
thing that Archy's finger was resting upon. There <lb/>
was a pause, then a several-barreled sigh of disap- <lb/>
pointment. Pat Riley and Ham Sandwich said, in <lb/>
the one breath:</p>
<p>"What is it, Archy? There's nothing here."</p>
<p>"Nothing? Do you call <i>that</i> nothing?" and he <lb/>
swiftly traced upon the ground a form with his <lb/>
finger. "There&#x2014;don't you recognize it now? <lb/>
It's Injun Billy's track. He's got the child."</p>
<p>"God be praised!" from the mother.</p>
<p>"Take away the lantern. I've got the direction. <lb/>
Follow!"</p>
<p>He started on a run, racing in and out among the <lb/>
sage-bushes a matter of three hundred yards, and <lb/>
disappeared over a sand-wave; the others struggled <lb/>
after him, caught him up, and found him waiting. <lb/>
<pb n="331"/>
Ten steps away was a little wickieup, a dim and <lb/>
formless shelter of rags and old horse-blankets, a <lb/>
dull light showing through its chinks.</p>
<p>"You lead, Mrs. Hogan," said the lad. "It's <lb/>
your privilege to be first."</p>
<p>All followed the sprint she made for the wickieup, <lb/>
and saw, with her, the picture its interior afforded. <lb/>
Injun Billy was sitting on the ground; the child was <lb/>
asleep beside him. The mother hugged it with a <lb/>
wild embrace, which included Archy Stillman, the <lb/>
grateful tears running down her face, and in a <lb/>
choked and broken voice she poured out a golden <lb/>
stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments <lb/>
which has its home in full richness nowhere but in <lb/>
the Irish heart.</p>
<p>"I find her bymeby it is ten o'clock," Billy ex- <lb/>
plained. "She 'sleep out yonder, ve'y tired&#x2014;face <lb/>
wet, been cryin', 'spose; fetch her home, feed her, <lb/>
she heap much hungry&#x2014;go 'sleep 'gin."</p>
<p>In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived <lb/>
rank and hugged him too, calling him "the angel of <lb/>
God in disguise." And he probably was in disguise <lb/>
if he was that kind of an official. He was dressed <lb/>
for the character.</p>
<p>At half-past one in the morning the procession <lb/>
burst into the village singing, "When Johnny Comes <lb/>
Marching Home," waving its lanterns, and swal- <lb/>
lowing the drinks that were brought out all along its <lb/>
course. It concentrated at the tavern, and made a <lb/>
night of what was left of the morning.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="VI">
<pb n="332"/>
<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> next afternoon the village was electrified with <lb/>
an immense sensation. A grave and dignified <lb/>
foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had <lb/>
arrived at the tavern, and entered this formidable <lb/>
name upon the register:</p>
<div4 type="subsection">
<head>SHERLOCK HOLMES.</head>
<p>The news buzzed from cabin to cabin, from claim <lb/>
to claim; tools were dropped, and the town swarmed <lb/>
toward the centre of interest. A man passing out <lb/>
at the northern end of the village shouted it to Pat <lb/>
Riley, whose claim was the next one to Flint Buck- <lb/>
ner's. At that time Fetlock Jones seemed to turn <lb/>
sick. He muttered to himself:</p>
<p>"Uncle <i>Sherlock!</i> The mean luck of it!&#x2014;that <lb/>
<i>he</i> should come just when &#x2026;." He dropped <lb/>
into a reverie, and presently said to himself: "But <lb/>
what's the use of being afraid of <i>him?</i> Anybody <lb/>
that knows him the way I do knows he can't <lb/>
detect a crime except where he plans it all out <lb/>
beforehand and arranges the clews and hires <lb/>
some fellow to commit it according to instructions. <lb/>
&#x2026; Now there ain't going to <i>be</i> any clews this <lb/>
<pb n="333"/>
time&#x2014;so, what show has he got? None at all. <lb/>
No, sir; everything's ready. If I was to risk put- <lb/>
ting it off&#x2014;.. No, I won't run any risk like that. <lb/>
Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for <lb/>
sure." Then another trouble presented itself. <lb/>
"Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters <lb/>
with me this evening, and how am I going to get rid <lb/>
of him? for I've <i>got</i> to be at my cabin a minute or <lb/>
two about eight o'clock." This was an awkward <lb/>
matter, and cost him much thought. But he found <lb/>
a way to beat the difficulty. "We'll go for a walk, <lb/>
and I'll leave him in the road a minute, so that he <lb/>
won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a <lb/>
detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along <lb/>
when you are preparing the thing. Yes, that's the <lb/>
safest&#x2014;I'll take him with me."</p>
<p>Meantime the road in front of the tavern was <lb/>
blocked with villagers waiting and hoping for a <lb/>
glimpse of the great man. But he kept his room, <lb/>
and did not appear. None but Ferguson, Jake <lb/>
Parker the blacksmith, and Ham Sandwich had any <lb/>
luck. These enthusiastic admirers of the great <lb/>
scientific detective hired the tavern's detained-bag- <lb/>
gage lockup, which looked into the detective's room <lb/>
across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide, am- <lb/>
bushed themselves in it, and cut some peep-holes in <lb/>
the window-blind. Mr. Holmes's blinds were down; <lb/>
but by and by he raised them. It gave the spies a <lb/>
hair-lifting but pleasurable thrill to find themselves <lb/>
face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had <lb/>
<pb n="334"/>
filled the world with the fame of his more than <lb/>
human ingenuities. There he sat&#x2014;not a myth, not <lb/>
a shadow, but real, alive, compact of substance, and <lb/>
almost within touching distance with the hand.</p>
<p>"Look at that head!" said Ferguson, in an awed <lb/>
voice. "By gracious! <i>that's</i> a head!"</p>
<p>"You bet!" said the blacksmith, with deep <lb/>
reverence. "Look at his nose! look at his eyes! <lb/>
Intellect? Just a battery of it!"</p>
<p>"And that paleness," said Ham Sandwich. <lb/>
"Comes from thought&#x2014;that's what it comes from. <lb/>
Hell! duffers like us don't know what real thought <lb/>
<i>is</i>."</p>
<p>"No more we don't," said Ferguson. "What <lb/>
we take for thinking is just blubber-and-slush."</p>
<p>"Right you are, Wells-Fargo. And look at that <lb/>
frown&#x2014;that's <i>deep</i> thinking&#x2014;away down, down, <lb/>
forty fathom into the bowels of things. He's on <lb/>
the track of something."</p>
<p>"Well, he is, and don't you forget it. Say&#x2014; <lb/>
look at that awful gravity&#x2014;look at that pallid sol- <lb/>
emnness&#x2014;there ain't any corpse can lay over it."</p>
<p>"No, sir, not for dollars! And it's his'n by <lb/>
hereditary rights, too; he's been dead four times <lb/>
a'ready, and there's history for it. Three times <lb/>
natural, once by accident. I've heard say he smells <lb/>
damp and cold, like a grave. And he&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"'Sh! Watch him! There&#x2014;he's got his <lb/>
thumb on the bump on the near corner of his fore- <lb/>
head, and his forefinger on the off one. His think- <lb/>
<pb n="335"/>
works is just a-<i>grinding</i> now, you bet your other <lb/>
shirt."</p>
<p>"That's so. And now he's gazing up toward <lb/>
heaven and stroking his mustache slow, and&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Now he has rose up standing, and is putting his <lb/>
clews together on his left fingers with his right <lb/>
finger. See? he touches the forefinger&#x2014;now mid- <lb/>
dle finger&#x2014;now ring-finger&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Stuck!"</p>
<p>"Look at him scowl! He can't seem to make <lb/>
out <i>that</i> clew. So he&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"See him smile!&#x2014;like a tiger&#x2014;and tally off the <lb/>
other fingers like nothing! He's got it, boys; he's <lb/>
got it sure!"</p>
<p>"Well, I should <i>say!</i> I'd hate to be in that <lb/>
man's place that he's after."</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes drew a table to the window, sat down <lb/>
with his back to the spies, and proceeded to write. <lb/>
The spies withdrew their eyes from the peep-holes, <lb/>
lit their pipes, and settled themselves for a comfort- <lb/>
able smoke and talk. Ferguson said, with conviction:</p>
<p>"Boys, it's no use calking, he's a wonder! He's <lb/>
got the signs of it all over him."</p>
<p>"You hain't ever said a truer word than that, <lb/>
Wells-Fargo," said Jake Parker. "Say, wouldn't <lb/>
it 'a' been nuts if he'd a-been here last night?"</p>
<p>"Oh, by George, but wouldn't it!" said Fergu- <lb/>
son. "Then we'd have seen <i>scientific</i> work. Intel- <lb/>
lect&#x2014;just pure intellect&#x2014;away up on the upper <lb/>
levels, dontchuknow. Archy is all right, and it don't <lb/>
<pb n="336"/>
become anybody to belittle <i>him</i>, I can tell you. <lb/>
But his gift is only just eyesight, sharp as an <lb/>
owl's, as near as I can make it out just a grand <lb/>
natural animal talent, no more, no less, and prime <lb/>
as far as it goes, but no intellect in it, and for awful- <lb/>
ness and marvelousness no more to be compared to <lb/>
what this man does than&#x2014;than&#x2014; Why, let me <lb/>
tell you what <i>he'd</i> have done. He'd have stepped <lb/>
over to Hogan's and glanced&#x2014;just <i>glanced</i>, that's <lb/>
all&#x2014;at the premises, and that's enough. See <lb/>
everything? Yes, sir, to the last little <i>de</i>tail; and <lb/>
he'd know more about that place than the Hogans <lb/>
would know in seven years. Next, he would sit <lb/>
down on the bunk, just as ca'm, and say to Mrs. <lb/>
Hogan&#x2014;<i>Say</i>, Ham, consider that you are Mrs. <lb/>
Hogan. I'll ask the questions; you answer them."</p>
<p>"All right; go on."</p>
<p>"'Madam, if you please&#x2014;attention&#x2014;do not let <lb/>
your mind wander. Now, then&#x2014;sex of the child?'</p>
<p>"'Female, your Honor.'</p>

<p>"'Turned six, your Honor.'</p>

<pb n="337"/>
<p>"'Yes, your Honor&#x2014;both.'</p>
<p>"'Yarn, perhaps? Morocco?'</p>
<p>"'Yarn, your Honor. And kip.'</p>

pellet of the floor dirt, if you'll be so kind. Thanks, <lb/>
many thanks. Ah, admirable, admirable! <i>Now</i> <lb/>
we know where we are, I think.' You see, boys, <lb/>
he's got all the clews he wants now; he don't need <lb/>
anything more. Now, then, what does this Ex- <lb/>
traordinary Man do? He lays those snips and that <lb/>
dirt out on the table and leans over them on his <lb/>
elbows, and puts them together side by side and <lb/>
studies them&#x2014;mumbles to himself, 'Female'; <lb/>
changes them around&#x2014;mumbles, 'Six years old'; <lb/>
changes them this way and that&#x2014;again mumbles: <lb/>
'Five teeth&#x2014;one a-coming&#x2014;Catholic&#x2014;yarn&#x2014; <lb/>
cotton&#x2014;kip&#x2014;damn that kip.' Then he straightens <lb/>
up and gazes toward heaven, and plows his hands <lb/>
through his hair&#x2014;plows and plows, muttering, <lb/>
'Damn that kip!' Then he stands up and frowns, <lb/>
and begins to tally off his clews on his fingers&#x2014;and <lb/>
gets stuck at the ring-finger. But only just a min- <lb/>
ute&#x2014;then his face glares all up in a smile like a <lb/>
<pb n="338"/>
house afire, and he straightens up stately and <lb/>
majestic, and says to the crowd, 'Take a lantern, a <lb/>
couple of you, and go down to Injun Billy's and <lb/>
fetch the child&#x2014;the rest of you go 'long home to <lb/>
bed; good-night, madam; good-night, gents.' And <lb/>
he bows like the Matterhorn, and pulls out for the <lb/>
tavern. That's <i>his</i> style, and the <i>Only</i>&#x2014;scientific, <lb/>
intellectual&#x2014;all over in fifteen minutes&#x2014;no pok- <lb/>
ing around all over the sage-brush range an hour <lb/>
and a half in a mass-meeting crowd for <i>him</i>, boys&#x2014; <lb/>
you hear <i>me!</i>"</p>
<p>"By Jackson, it's grand!" said Ham Sandwich. <lb/>
"Wells-Fargo, you've got him down to a dot. <lb/>
He ain't painted up any exacter to the life in the <lb/>
books. By George, I can just <i>see</i> him&#x2014;can't you, <lb/>
boys?"</p>
<p>"You bet you! It's just a photograft, that's <lb/>
what it is."</p>
<p>Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success, <lb/>
and grateful. He sat silently enjoying his happiness <lb/>
a little while, then he murmured, with a deep awe in <lb/>
his voice,</p>
<p>"I wonder if God made him?"</p>
<p>There was no response for a moment; then Ham <lb/>
Sandwich said, reverently,</p>
<p>"Not all at one time, I reckon."</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p><smcap>At</smcap> eight o'clock that evening two persons were <lb/>
groping their way past Flint Buckner's cabin <lb/>
in the frosty gloom. They were Sherlock Holmes <lb/>
and his nephew.</p>
<p>"Stop here in the road a moment, uncle," said <lb/>
Fetlock, "while I run to my cabin; I won't be gone <lb/>
a minute."</p>
<p>He asked for something&#x2014;the uncle furnished it <lb/>
&#x2014;then he disappeared in the darkness, but soon re- <lb/>
turned, and the talking-walk was resumed. By nine <lb/>
o'clock they had wandered back to the tavern. <lb/>
They worked their way through the billiard-room, <lb/>
where a crowd had gathered in the hope of getting <lb/>
a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man. A royal cheer <lb/>
was raised. Mr. Holmes acknowledged the compli- <lb/>
ment with a series of courtly bows, and as he was <lb/>
passing out his nephew said to the assemblage,</p>
<p>"Uncle Sherlock's got some work to do, gentle- <lb/>
men, that 'll keep him till twelve or one; but he'll be <lb/>
down again then, or earlier if he can, and hopes <lb/>
some of you'll be left to take a drink with him."</p>
<p>"By George, he's just a duke, boys! Three <lb/>
cheers for Sherlock Holmes, the greatest man that <lb/>
<pb n="340"/>
ever lived!" shouted Ferguson. "Hip, hip <lb/>
hip&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Tiger!"</p>
<p>The uproar shook the building, so hearty was the <lb/>
feeling the boys put into their welcome. Upstairs <lb/>
the uncle reproached the nephew gently, saying,</p>
<p>"What did you get me into that engagement for?"</p>
<p>"I reckon you don't want to be unpopular, do <lb/>
you, uncle? Well, then, don't you put on any ex- <lb/>
clusiveness in a mining-camp, that's all. The boys <lb/>
admire you; but if you was to leave without taking <lb/>
a drink with them, they'd set you down for a snob. <lb/>
And besides, you said you had home talk enough <lb/>
in stock to keep us up and at it half the night."</p>
<p>The boy was right, and wise&#x2014;the uncle acknowl- <lb/>
edged it. The boy was wise in another detail which <lb/>
he did not mention,&#x2014;except to himself: "Uncle <lb/>
and the others will come handy&#x2014;in the way of nail- <lb/>
ing an <foreign lang="ita"><i>alibi</i></foreign> where it can't be budged."</p>
<p>He and his uncle talked diligently about three <lb/>
hours. Then, about midnight, Fetlock stepped <lb/>
downstairs and took a position in the dark a dozen <lb/>
steps from the tavern, and waited. Five minutes <lb/>
later Flint Buckner came rocking out of the billiard- <lb/>
room and almost brushed him as he passed.</p>
<p>"I've <i>got</i> him!" muttered the boy. He con- <lb/>
tinued to himself, looking after the shadowy form: <lb/>
"Good-by&#x2014;good-by for good, Flint Buckner; you <lb/>
called my mother a&#x2014;well, never mind what: it's all <lb/>
right, now; you're taking your last walk, friend."</p>
<pb n="341"/>
<p>He went musing back into the tavern. "From <lb/>
now till one is an hour. We'll spend it with the <lb/>
boys: it's good for the <foreign lang="ita"><i>alibi</i>."</foreign></p>
<p>He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiard- <lb/>
room, which was jammed with eager and admiring <lb/>
miners; the guest called the drinks, and the fun be- <lb/>
gan. Everybody was happy; everybody was com- <lb/>
plimentary; the ice was soon broken, songs, anec- <lb/>
dotes, and more drinks followed, and the pregnant <lb/>
minutes flew. At six minutes to one, when the <lb/>
jollity was at its highest&#x2014;</p>
<p><i>Boom!</i></p>
<p>There was silence instantly. The deep sound <lb/>
came rolling and rumbling from peak to peak up <lb/>
the gorge, then died down, and ceased. The spell <lb/>
broke, then, and the men made a rush for the door, <lb/>
saying,</p>
<p>"Something's blown up!"</p>
<p>Outside, a voice in the darkness said,</p>
<p>"It's away down the gorge; I saw the flash."</p>
<p>The crowd poured down the canyon&#x2014;Holmes, <lb/>
Fetlock, Archy Stillman, everybody. They made <lb/>
the mile in a few minutes. By the light of a lantern <lb/>
they found the smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint <lb/>
Buckner's cabin; of the cabin itself not a vestige <lb/>
remained, not a rag nor a splinter. Nor any sign of <lb/>
Flint. Search parties sought here and there and <lb/>
yonder, and presently a cry went up.</p>
<p>"Here he is!"</p>
<p>It was true. Fifty yards down the gulch they had <lb/>
<pb n="342"/>
found him&#x2014;that is, they had found a crushed and <lb/>
lifeless mass which represented him. Fetlock Jones <lb/>
hurried thither with the others and looked.</p>
<p>The inquest was a fifteen-minute affair. Ham <lb/>
Sandwich, foreman of the jury, handed up the <lb/>
verdict, which was phrased with a certain unstudied <lb/>
literary grace, and closed with this finding, to wit: <lb/>
that "deceased came to his death by his own act or <lb/>
some other person or persons unknown to this jury <lb/>
not leaving any family or similar effects behind but <lb/>
his cabin which was blown away and God have <lb/>
mercy on his soul amen."</p>
<p>Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd, <lb/>
for the storm-centre of interest was there&#x2014;Sher- <lb/>
lock Holmes. The miners stood silent and reverent <lb/>
in a half-circle, enclosing a large vacant space which <lb/>
included the front exposure of the site of the late <lb/>
premises. In this considerable space the Extraor- <lb/>
dinary Man was moving about, attended by his <lb/>
nephew with a lantern. With a tape he took meas- <lb/>
urements of the cabin site; of the distance from the <lb/>
wall of chaparral to the road; of the height of the <lb/>
chaparral bushes; also various other measurements. <lb/>
He gathered a rag here, a splinter there, and a pinch <lb/>
of earth yonder, inspected them profoundly, and <lb/>
preserved them. He took the "lay" of the place <lb/>
with a pocket compass, allowing two seconds for <lb/>
magnetic variation. He took the time (Pacific) by <lb/>
his watch, correcting it for local time. He paced off <lb/>
the distance from the cabin site to the corpse, and <lb/>
<pb n="343"/>
corrected that for tidal differentiation. He took the <lb/>
altitude with a pocket-aneroid, and the temperature <lb/>
with a pocket-thermometer. Finally he said, with a <lb/>
stately bow:</p>
<p>"It is finished. Shall we return, gentlemen?"</p>
<p>He took up the line of march for the tavern, and <lb/>
the crowd fell into his wake, earnestly discussing and <lb/>
admiring the Extraordinary Man, and interlarding <lb/>
guesses as to the origin of the tragedy and who the <lb/>
author of it might be.</p>
<p>"My, but it's grand luck having him here&#x2014;hey, <lb/>
boys?" said Ferguson.</p>
<p>"It's the biggest thing of the century," said Ham <lb/>
Sandwich. "It 'll go all over the world; you mark <lb/>
my words."</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> bet!" said Jake Parker the blacksmith. <lb/>
"It 'll boom this camp. Ain't it so, Wells- <lb/>
Fargo?"</p>
<p>"Well, as you want my opinion&#x2014;if it's any sign <lb/>
of how <i>I</i> think about it, I can tell you this: yester- <lb/>
day I was holding the Straight Flush claim at two <lb/>
dollars a foot; I'd like to see the man that can get <lb/>
it at sixteen to-day."</p>
<p>"Right you are, Wells-Fargo! It's the grandest <lb/>
luck a new camp ever struck. Say, did you see him <lb/>
collar them little rags and dirt and things? What an <lb/>
eye! He just can't overlook a clew&#x2014;'tain't <i>in</i> him."</p>
<p>"That's so. And they wouldn't mean a thing to <lb/>
anybody else; but to him, why, they're just a book <lb/>
&#x2014;large print at that."</p>
<pb n="344"/>
<p>"Sure's you're born! Them odds and ends have <lb/>
got their little old secret, and they think there ain't <lb/>
anybody can pull it; but, land! when he sets his <lb/>
grip there they've got to squeal, and don't you for- <lb/>
get it."</p>
<p>"Boys, I ain't sorry, now, that he wasn't here to <lb/>
roust out the child; this is a bigger thing, by a long <lb/>
sight. Yes, sir, and more tangled up and scientific <lb/>
and intellectual."</p>
<p>"I reckon we're all of us glad it's turned out this <lb/>
way. Glad? 'George! it ain't any name for it. <lb/>
Dontchuknow, Archy could 've <i>learnt</i> something if <lb/>
he'd had the nous to stand by and take notice of <lb/>
how that man works the system. But no; he went <lb/>
poking up into the chaparral and just missed the <lb/>
whole thing."</p>
<p>"It's true as gospel; I seen it myself. Well, <lb/>
Archy's young. He'll know better one of these <lb/>
days."</p>
<p>"Say, boys, who do you reckon done it?"</p>
<p>That was a difficult question, and brought out a <lb/>
world of unsatisfying conjecture. Various men were <lb/>
mentioned as possibilities, but one by one they were <lb/>
discarded as not being eligible. No one but young <lb/>
Hillyer had been intimate with Flint Buckner; no <lb/>
one had really had a quarrel with him; he had <lb/>
affronted every man who had tried to make up to <lb/>
him, although not quite offensively enough to require <lb/>
bloodshed. There was one name that was upon <lb/>
every tongue from the start, but it was the last to get <lb/>
<pb n="345"/>
utterance&#x2014;Fetlock Jones's. It was Pat Riley that <lb/>
mentioned it.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," the boys said, "of course we've all <lb/>
thought of him, because he had a million rights to <lb/>
kill Flint Buckner, and it was just his plain duty to <lb/>
do it. But all the same there's two things we can't <lb/>
get around: for one thing, he hasn't got the sand; <lb/>
and for another, he wasn't anywhere near the place <lb/>
when it happened."</p>
<p>"I know it," said Pat. "He was there in the <lb/>
billiard-room with us when it happened."</p>
<p>"Yes, and was there all the time for an hour <i>before</i> <lb/>
it happened."</p>
<p>"It's so. And lucky for him, too. He'd have <lb/>
been suspected in a minute if it hadn't been for <lb/>
that."</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p><smcap>The</smcap> tavern dining-room had been cleared of all its <lb/>
furniture save one six-foot pine table and a <lb/>
chair. This table was against one end of the room; <lb/>
the chair was on it; Sherlock Holmes, stately, im- <lb/>
posing, impressive, sat in the chair. The public <lb/>
stood. The room was full. The tobacco smoke <lb/>
was dense, the stillness profound.</p>
<p>The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to com- <lb/>
mand additional silence; held it in the air a few <lb/>
moments; then, in brief, crisp terms he put forward <lb/>
question after question, and noted the answers with <lb/>
"Um-ums," nods of the head, and so on. By this <lb/>
process he learned all about Flint Buckner, his char- <lb/>
acter, conduct, and habits, that the people were able <lb/>
to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordi- <lb/>
nary Man's nephew was the only person in the camp <lb/>
who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner. <lb/>
Mr. Holmes smiled compassionately upon the wit- <lb/>
ness, and asked, languidly&#x2014;</p>
<p>"Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where <lb/>
the lad Fetlock Jones was at the time of the ex- <lb/>
plosion?"</p>
<p>A thunderous response followed&#x2014;</p>
<pb n="347"/>
<p>"In the billiard-room of this house!"</p>
<p>"Ah. And had he just come in?"</p>
<p>"Been there all of an hour!"</p>
<p>"Ah. It is about&#x2014;about&#x2014;well, about how far <lb/>
might it be to the scene of the explosion?"</p>
<p>"All of a mile!"</p>
<p>"Ah. It isn't <i>much</i> of an <foreign lang="ita">alibi,</foreign> 'tis true, but&#x2014;"</p>
<p>A storm-burst of laughter, mingled with shouts <lb/>
of "By jiminy, but he's chain-lightning!" and <lb/>
"Ain't you sorry you spoke, Sandy?" shut off the <lb/>
rest of the sentence, and the crushed witness drooped <lb/>
his blushing face in pathetic shame. The inquisitor <lb/>
resumed:</p>
<p>"The lad Jones's somewhat <i>distant</i> connection <lb/>
with the case" (<i>laughter</i>) "having been disposed <lb/>
of, let us now call the <i>eye</i>-witnesses of the tragedy, <lb/>
and listen to what they have to say."</p>
<p>He got out his fragmentary clews and arranged <lb/>
them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee. The <lb/>
house held its breath and watched.</p>
<p>"We have the longitude and the latitude, cor- <lb/>
rected for magnetic variation, and this gives us the <lb/>
exact location of the tragedy. We have the altitude, <lb/>
the temperature, and the degree of humidity pre- <lb/>
vailing&#x2014;inestimably valuable, since they enable us <lb/>
to estimate with precision the degree of influence <lb/>
which they would exercise upon the mood and dis- <lb/>
position of the assassin at that time of the night."</p>
<p>(<i>Buzz of admiration; muttered remark, "By <lb/>
George, but he's deep!"</i>) He fingered his clews. <lb/>
<pb n="348"/>
"And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak <lb/>
to us.</p>
<p>"Here we have an empty linen shotbag. What is <lb/>
its message? This: that robbery was the motive, <lb/>
not revenge. What is its further message? This: <lb/>
that the assassin was of inferior intelligence&#x2014;shall <lb/>
we say light-witted, or perhaps approaching that? <lb/>
How do we know this? Because a person of sound <lb/>
intelligence would not have proposed to rob the man <lb/>
Buckner, who never had much money with him. <lb/>
But the assassin might have been a stranger? Let <lb/>
the bag speak again. I take from it this article. It <lb/>
is a bit of silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Ex- <lb/>
amine it, please&#x2014;you&#x2014;and you&#x2014;and you. Now <lb/>
pass it back, please. There is but one lode on this <lb/>
coast which produces just that character and color of <lb/>
quartz; and that is a lode which crops out for nearly <lb/>
two miles on a stretch, and in my opinion is des- <lb/>
tined, at no distant day, to confer upon its locality a <lb/>
globe-girdling celebrity, and upon its two hundred <lb/>
owners riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Name <lb/>
that lode, please."</p>
<p>"The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary <lb/>
Ann!" was the prompt response.</p>
<p>A wild crash of hurrahs followed, and every man <lb/>
reached for his neighbor's hand and wrung it, with <lb/>
tears in his eyes; and Wells-Fargo Ferguson <lb/>
shouted, "The Straight Flush is on the lode, and up <lb/>
she goes to a hundred and fifty a foot&#x2014;you hear <lb/>
<i>me!</i>"</p>
<pb n="349"/>
<p>When quiet fell, Mr. Holmes resumed:</p>
<p>"We perceive, then, that three facts are estab- <lb/>
lished, to wit: the assassin was approximately light- <lb/>
witted; he was not a stranger; his motive was rob- <lb/>
bery, not revenge. Let us proceed. I hold in my <lb/>
hand a small fragment of fuse, with the recent smell <lb/>
of fire upon it. What is its testimony? Taken <lb/>
with the corroborative evidence of the quartz, it re- <lb/>
veals to us that the assassin was a miner. What <lb/>
does it tell us further? This, gentlemen: that the <lb/>
assassination was consummated by means of an ex- <lb/>
plosive. What else does it say? This: that the ex- <lb/>
plosive was located against the side of the cabin <lb/>
nearest the road&#x2014;the front side&#x2014;for within six <lb/>
feet of that spot I found it.</p>
<p>"I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish match&#x2014; <lb/>
the kind one rubs on a safety-box. I found it in the <lb/>
road, 622 feet from the abolished cabin. What does <lb/>
it say? This: that the train was fired from that <lb/>
point. What further does it tell us? This: that the <lb/>
assassin was left-handed. How do I know this? I <lb/>
should not be able to explain to you, gentlemen, <lb/>
how I know it, the signs being so subtle that only <lb/>
long experience and deep study can enable one to <lb/>
detect them. But the signs are here, and they are <lb/>
reinforced by a fact which you must have often <lb/>
noticed in the great detective narratives&#x2014;that <i>all</i> <lb/>
assassins are left-handed."</p>
<p>"By Jackson, <i>that's</i> so!" said Ham Sandwich, <lb/>
bringing his great hand down with a resounding slap <lb/>
<pb n="350"/>
upon his thigh; "blamed if I ever thought of it <lb/>
before."</p>
<p>"Nor I!" "Nor I!" cried several. "Oh, <lb/>
there can't anything escape <i>him</i>&#x2014;look at his eye!"</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, distant as the murderer was from his <lb/>
doomed victim, he did not wholly escape injury. <lb/>
This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to you <lb/>
struck him. It drew blood. Wherever he is, he <lb/>
bears the telltale mark. I picked it up where he <lb/>
stood when he fired the fatal train." He looked <lb/>
out over the house from his high perch, and his <lb/>
countenance began to darken; he slowly raised his <lb/>
hand, and pointed&#x2014;</p>
<p>"There stands the assassin!"</p>
<p>For a moment the house was paralyzed with <lb/>
amazement; then twenty voices burst out with:</p>
<p>"Sammy Hillyer? Oh, <i>hell</i>, no! <i>Him?</i> It's <lb/>
pure foolishness!"</p>
<p>"Take care, gentlemen&#x2014;be not hasty. Observe <lb/>
&#x2014;he has the blood-mark on his brow."</p>
<p>Hillyer turned white with fright. He was near to <lb/>
crying. He turned this way and that, appealing to <lb/>
every face for help and sympathy; and held out his <lb/>
supplicating hands toward Holmes and began to <lb/>
plead:</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i>, oh, don't! I never did it; I give my <lb/>
word I never did it. The way I got this hurt on <lb/>
my forehead was&#x2014;"</p>
<p>"Arrest him, constable!" cried Holmes. "I <lb/>
will swear out the warrant."</p>
<pb n="351"/>
<p>The constable moved reluctantly forward&#x2014;hesi- <lb/>
tated&#x2014;stopped.</p>
<p>Hillyer broke out with another appeal. "Oh, <lb/>
Archy, don't let them do it; it would kill mother! <lb/>
<i>You</i> know how I got the hurt. Tell them, and <lb/>
save me, Archy; save me!"</p>
<p>Stillman worked his way to the front, and said:</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll save you. Don't be afraid." Then <lb/>
he said to the house, "Never mind how he got the <lb/>
hurt; it hasn't anything to do with this case, and <lb/>
isn't of any consequence."</p>
<p>"God bless you, Archy, for a true friend!"</p>
<p>"Hurrah for Archy! Go in, boy, and play 'em <lb/>
a knock-down flush to their two pair 'n' a jack!" <lb/>
shouted the house, pride in their home talent and a <lb/>
patriotic sentiment of loyalty to it rising suddenly <lb/>
in the public heart and changing the whole attitude <lb/>
of the situation.</p>
<p>Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease; <lb/>
then he said,</p>
<p>"I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door <lb/>
yonder, and Constable Harris to stand by the other <lb/>
one here, and not let anybody leave the room."</p>
<p>"Said and done. Go on, old man!"</p>
<p>"The criminal is present, I believe. I will show <lb/>
him to you before long, in case I am right in my <lb/>
guess. Now I will tell you all about the tragedy, <lb/>
from start to finish. The motive <i>wasn't</i> robbery; <lb/>
it was revenge. The murderer <i>wasn't</i> light-witted. <lb/>
He <i>didn't</i> stand 622 feet away. He <i>didn't</i> get hit <lb/>
<pb n="352"/>
with a piece of wood. He <i>didn't</i> place the explo- <lb/>
sive against the cabin. He <i>didn't</i> bring a shot-bag <lb/>
with him, and he <i>wasn't</i> left-handed. With the ex- <lb/>
ception of these errors, the distinguished guest's <lb/>
statement of the case is substantially correct."</p>
<p>A comfortable laugh rippled over the house; <lb/>
friend nodded to friend, as much as to say, "That's <lb/>
the word, with the bark <i>on</i> it. Good lad, good boy. <lb/>
<i>He</i> ain't lowering his flag any!"</p>
<p>The guest's serenity was not disturbed. Stillman <lb/>
resumed:</p>
<p>"I also have some witnesses; and I will presently <lb/>
tell you where you can find some more." He held <lb/>
up a piece of coarse wire; the crowd craned their <lb/>
necks to see. "It has a smooth coating of melted <lb/>
tallow on it. And here is a candle which is burned <lb/>
half-way down. The remaining half of it has marks <lb/>
cut upon it an inch apart. Soon I will tell you where <lb/>
I found these things. I will now put aside reasonings, <lb/>
guesses, the impressive hitchings of odds and ends <lb/>
of clews together, and the other showy theatricals of <lb/>
the detective trade, and tell you in a plain, straight- <lb/>
forward way just how this dismal thing happened."</p>
<p>He paused a moment, for effect&#x2014;to allow silence <lb/>
and suspense to intensify and concentrate the house's <lb/>
interest; then he went on:</p>
<p>"The assassin studied out his plan with a good <lb/>
deal of pains. It was a good plan, very ingenious, <lb/>
and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. <lb/>
It was a plan which was well calculated to ward off <lb/>
<pb n="353"/>
all suspicion from its inventor. In the first place, <lb/>
he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit <lb/>
it and timed it. He found it took three hours to <lb/>
burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half an <lb/>
hour, awhile ago, upstairs here, while the inquiry <lb/>
into Flint Buckner's character and ways was being <lb/>
conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at <lb/>
the rate of a candle's consumption when sheltered <lb/>
from the wind. Having proved his trial-candle's <lb/>
rate, he blew it out&#x2014;I have already shown it to you <lb/>
&#x2014;and put his inch-marks on a fresh one.</p>
<p>"He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick. <lb/>
Then at the five-hour mark he bored a hole through <lb/>
the candle with a red-hot wire. I have already <lb/>
shown you the wire, with a smooth coat of tallow on <lb/>
it&#x2014;tallow that had been melted and had cooled.</p>
<p>"With labor&#x2014;very hard labor, I should say&#x2014; <lb/>
he struggled up through the stiff chaparral that <lb/>
clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckner's <lb/>
place, tugging an empty flour-barrel with him. He <lb/>
placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and <lb/>
in the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he <lb/>
measured off about thirty-five feet of fuse&#x2014;the <lb/>
barrel's distance from the back of the cabin. He <lb/>
bored a hole in the side of the barrel&#x2014;here is the <lb/>
large gimlet he did it with. He went on and <lb/>
finished his work; and when it was done, one end of <lb/>
the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other end, <lb/>
with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was <lb/>
in the hole in the candle&#x2014;timed to blow the place <lb/>
<pb n="354"/>
up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle <lb/>
was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening&#x2014; <lb/>
which I am betting it was&#x2014;and provided there was <lb/>
an explosive in the cabin and connected with that <lb/>
end of the fuse&#x2014;which I am also betting there was, <lb/>
though I can't prove it. Boys, the barrel is there in <lb/>
the chaparral, the candle's remains are in it in the tin <lb/>
stick; the burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the <lb/>
other end is down the hill where the late cabin <lb/>
stood. I saw them all an hour or two ago, when <lb/>
the Professor here was measuring off unimplicated <lb/>
vacancies and collecting relics that hadn't anything <lb/>
to do with the case."</p>
<p>He paused. The house drew a long, deep breath, <lb/>
shook its strained cords and muscles free and burst <lb/>
into cheers. "Dang him!" said Ham Sandwich, <lb/>
"that's why he was snooping around in the chaparral, <lb/>
instead of picking up points out of the P'fessor's <lb/>
game. Looky here&#x2014;<i>he</i> ain't no fool, boys."</p>
<p>"No, sir! Why, great Scott&#x2014;"</p>
<p>But Stillman was resuming:</p>
<p>"While we were out yonder an hour or two ago, <lb/>
the owner of the gimlet and the trial-candle took <lb/>
them from a place where he had concealed them&#x2014; <lb/>
it was not a good place&#x2014;and carried them to what <lb/>
he probably thought was a better one, two hundred <lb/>
yards up in the pine woods, and hid them there, <lb/>
covering them over with pine needles. It was there <lb/>
that I found them. The gimlet exactly fits the hole <lb/>
in the barrel. And now&#x2014;"</p>
<pb n="355"/>
<p>The Extraordinary Man interrupted him. He <lb/>
said, sarcastically:</p>
<p>"We have had a very pretty fairy-tale, gentlemen <lb/>
&#x2014;very pretty indeed. Now I would like to ask this <lb/>
young man a question or two."</p>
<p>Some of the boys winced, and Ferguson said,</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Archy's going to catch it now."</p>
<p>The others lost their smiles and sobered down. <lb/>
Mr. Holmes said:</p>
<p>"Let us proceed to examine into this fairy-tale in <lb/>
a consecutive and orderly way&#x2014;by geometrical <lb/>
progression, so to speak&#x2014;linking detail to detail in <lb/>
a steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent <lb/>
and unassailable march upon this tinsel toy-fortress <lb/>
of error, the dream-fabric of a callow imagination. <lb/>
To begin with, young sir, I desire to ask you but <lb/>
three questions at present&#x2014;<i>at present</i>. Did I <lb/>
understand you to say it was your opinion that the <lb/>
supposititious candle was lighted at about eight <lb/>
o'clock yesterday evening?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir&#x2014;about eight."</p>
<p>"Could you say exactly eight?"</p>
<p>"Well, no, I couldn't be that exact."</p>
<p>"Um. If a person had been passing along there <lb/>
just about that time, he would have been almost sure <lb/>
to encounter that assassin, do you think?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I should think so."</p>
<p>"Thank you, that is all. For the present. I say, <lb/>
all <i>for the present</i>."</p>
<p>"Dern him! he's laying for Archy," said Ferguson.</p>
<pb n="356"/>
<p>"It's so," said Ham Sandwich. "I don't like <lb/>
the look of it."</p>
<p>Stillman said, glancing at the guest,</p>
<p>"I was along there myself at half past eight&#x2014; <lb/>
no, about nine."</p>
<p>"In-deed? This is interesting&#x2014;this is very in- <lb/>
teresting. Perhaps you encountered the assassin?"</p>
<p>"No, I encountered no one."</p>
<p>"Ah. Then&#x2014;if you will excuse the remark&#x2014;I <lb/>
do not quite see the relevancy of the information."</p>
<p>"It has none. At present. I say it has none&#x2014; <lb/>
at present."</p>
<p>He paused. Presently he resumed: "I did not <lb/>
encounter the assassin, but I am on his track, I am <lb/>
sure, for I believe he is in this room. I will ask you <lb/>
all to pass one by one in front of me&#x2014;here, where <lb/>
there is a good light&#x2014;so that I can see your feet."</p>
<p>A buzz of excitement swept the place, and the <lb/>
march began, the guest looking on with an iron <lb/>
attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified suc- <lb/>
cess. Stillman stooped, shaded his eyes with his <lb/>
hand, and gazed down intently at each pair of feet <lb/>
as it passed. Fifty men tramped monotonously by <lb/>
&#x2014;with no result. Sixty. Seventy. The thing was <lb/>
beginning to look absurd. The guest remarked, <lb/>
with suave irony,</p>
<p>"Assassins appear to be scarce this evening."</p>
<p>The house saw the humor of it, and refreshed it- <lb/>
self with a cordial laugh. Ten or twelve more can- <lb/>
didates tramped by&#x2014;no, <i>danced</i> by, with airy and</p>
<pb/>
<pb/>
<p><i>Stillman accuses Sherlock Holmes</i></p>
<pb/>
<figure/>
<pb/>
<pb n="357"/>
<p>ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectators&#x2014; <lb/>
then suddenly Stillman put out his hand and said,</p>
<p>"This is the assassin!"</p>
<p>"Fetlock Jones, by the great Sanhedrim!" roared <lb/>
the crowd; and at once let fly a pyrotechnic explo- <lb/>
sion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks in- <lb/>
spired by the situation.</p>
<p>At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched <lb/>
out his hand, commanding peace. The authority of <lb/>
a great name and a great personality laid its mysteri- <lb/>
ous compulsion upon the house, and it obeyed. <lb/>
Out of the panting calm which succeeded, the guest <lb/>
spoke, saying, with dignity and feeling:</p>
<p>"<i>This</i> is serious. It strikes at an innocent life. <lb/>
Innocent beyond suspicion! Innocent beyond per- <lb/>
adventure! Hear me <i>prove</i> it; observe how simple <lb/>
a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie. <lb/>
Listen. My friends, that lad was never out of my <lb/>
sight yesterday evening at <i>any</i> time!"</p>
<p>It made a deep impression. Men turned their <lb/>
eyes upon Stillman with grave inquiry in them. <lb/>
His face brightened, and he said,</p>
<p>"I <i>knew</i> there was another one!" He stepped <lb/>
briskly to the table and glanced at the guest's feet, <lb/>
then up at his face, and said: "You were <i>with</i> him! <lb/>
You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the <lb/>
candle that by and by fired the powder!" (<i>Sensa- <lb/>
tion</i>.) "And what is more, you furnished the <lb/>
matches yourself!"</p>
<p>Plainly the guest seemed hit; it looked so to the <lb/>
<pb n="358"/>
public. He opened his mouth to speak; the words <lb/>
did not come freely.</p>
<p>"This&#x2014;er&#x2014;this is insanity&#x2014;this&#x2014;"</p>
<p>Stillman pressed his evident advantage home. He <lb/>
held up a charred match.</p>
<p>"Here is one of them. I found it in the barrel <lb/>
&#x2014;and there's <i>another</i> one there."</p>
<p>The guest found his voice at once.</p>
<p>"<i>Yes</i>&#x2014;and put them there yourself!"</p>
<p>It was recognized a good shot. Stillman retorted.</p>
<p>"It is <i>wax</i>&#x2014;a breed unknown to this camp. I <lb/>
am ready to be searched for the box. Are you?"</p>
<p>The guest was staggered this time&#x2014;the dullest <lb/>
eye could see it. He fumbled with his hands; once <lb/>
or twice his lips moved, but the words did not come. <lb/>
The house waited and watched, in tense suspense, <lb/>
the stillness adding effect to the situation. Presently <lb/>
Stillman said, gently,</p>
<p>"We are waiting for your decision."</p>
<p>There was silence again during several moments; <lb/>
then the guest answered, in a low voice,</p>
<p>"I refuse to be searched."</p>
<p>There was no noisy demonstration, but all about <lb/>
the house one voice after another muttered:</p>
<p>"That settles it! He's Archy's meat."</p>
<p>What to do now? Nobody seemed to know. It <lb/>
was an embarrassing situation for the moment&#x2014; <lb/>
merely, of course, because matters had taken such a <lb/>
sudden and unexpected turn that these unpracticed <lb/>
minds were not prepared for it, and had come to a <lb/>
<pb n="359"/>
standstill, like a stopped clock, under the shock. <lb/>
But after a little the machinery began to work again, <lb/>
tentatively, and by twos and threes the men put their <lb/>
heads together and privately buzzed over this and <lb/>
that and the other proposition. One of these <lb/>
propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer <lb/>
upon the assassin a vote of thanks for removing Flint <lb/>
Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads op- <lb/>
posed it, pointing out that addled brains in the East- <lb/>
ern States would pronounce it a scandal, and make <lb/>
no end of foolish noise about it. Finally the cool <lb/>
heads got the upper hand, and obtained general con- <lb/>
sent to a proposition of their own; their leader then <lb/>
called the house to order and stated it&#x2014;to this effect: <lb/>
that Fetlock Jones be jailed and put upon trial.</p>
<p>The motion was carried. Apparently there was <lb/>
nothing further to do now, and the people were glad, <lb/>
for, privately, they were impatient to get out and <lb/>
rush to the scene of the tragedy, and see whether that <lb/>
barrel and the other things were really there or not.</p>
<p>But no&#x2014;the break-up got a check. The sur- <lb/>
prises were not over yet. For a while Fetlock Jones <lb/>
had been silently sobbing, unnoticed in the absorb- <lb/>
ing excitements which had been following one an- <lb/>
other so persistently for some time; but when his <lb/>
arrest and trial were decreed, he broke out despair- <lb/>
ingly, and said:</p>
<p>"No! it's no use. I don't want any jail, I don't <lb/>
want any trial; I've had all the hard luck I want, <lb/>
and all the miseries. Hang me now, and let me <lb/>
<pb n="360"/>
out! It would all come out, anyway&#x2014;there <lb/>
couldn't anything save me. He has told it all, just <lb/>
as if he'd been with me and seen it&#x2014;<i>I</i> don't know <lb/>
how he found out; and you'll find the barrel and <lb/>
things, and then I wouldn't have any chance any <lb/>
more. I killed him; and <i>you'd</i> have done it too, if <lb/>
he'd treated you like a dog, and you only a boy, <lb/>
and weak and poor, and not a friend to help you."</p>
<p>"And served him damned well right!" broke in <lb/>
Ham Sandwich. "Looky here, boys&#x2014;"</p>
<p>From the constable: "Order! Order, gentle- <lb/>
men!"</p>
<p>A voice: "Did your uncle know what you was <lb/>
up to?"</p>
<p>"No, he didn't."</p>
<p>"Did he give you the matches, sure enough?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he did; but he didn't know what I wanted <lb/>
them for."</p>
<p>"When you was out on such a business as that, <lb/>
how did you venture to risk having him along&#x2014;and <lb/>
him a <i>detective?</i> How's that?"</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, fumbled with his buttons in an <lb/>
embarrassed way, then said, shyly,</p>
<p>"I know about detectives, on account of having <lb/>
them in the family; and if you don't want them to <lb/>
find out about a thing, it's best to have them around <lb/>
when you do it."</p>
<p>The cyclone of laughter which greeted this na&#x00EF;ve <lb/>
discharge of wisdom did not modify the poor little <lb/>
waif's embarrassment in any large degree.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p><smcap>From</smcap> a letter to Mrs. Stillman, dated merely <lb/>
"Tuesday."</p>
<q>Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log <lb/>
cabin, and left there to await his trial. Constable Harris provided him <lb/>
with a couple of days' rations, instructed him to keep a good guard <lb/>
over himself, and promised to look in on him as soon as further supplies <lb/>
should be due.</q>
<q>Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, <lb/>
and helped him bury his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I <lb/>
acted as first assistant pall-bearer, Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we <lb/>
had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger, carrying an <lb/>
old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the scent I <lb/>
had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my per- <lb/>
ishing hope!</q>
<q>In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his <lb/>
shoulder. He slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had <lb/>
withered him in his tracks; and as the boys came running he struggled <lb/>
to his knees and put up his pleading hands to me, and out of his chat- <lb/>
tering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more, and said,</q>
<q>"You have hunted me around the world, Sherlock Holmes, yet God <lb/>
is my witness I have never done any man harm!"</q>
<q>A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was <lb/>
my work, mother! The tidings of your death can some day repeat the <lb/>
misery I felt in that moment, but nothing else can ever do it. The boys <lb/>
lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were full of pity of him, <lb/>
and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said cheer up <lb/>
and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take <lb/>
care of him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on <lb/>
him. They are just like so many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys <lb/>
<pb n="362"/>
are, when you wake up the south side of their hearts; yes, and just <lb/>
like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up the <lb/>
opposite side of that muscle. They did everything they could think of <lb/>
to comfort him, but nothing succeeded until Wells-Fargo Ferguson, who <lb/>
is a clever strategist, said,</q>
<q>"If it's only Sherlock Holmes that's troubling you, you needn't <lb/>
worry any more."</q>
<q>"Why?" asked the forlorn lunatic, eagerly.</q>
<q>"Because he's dead again."</q>
<q>"Dead! Dead! Oh, don't trifle with a poor wreck like me. <i>Is</i> <lb/>
he dead? On honor, now&#x2014;is he telling me true, boys?"</q>
<q>"True as you're standing there!" said Ham Sandwich, and they all <lb/>
backed up the statement in a body.</q>
<q>"They hung him in San Bernardino last week," added Ferguson, <lb/>
clinching the matter, "whilst he was searching around after you. Mis- <lb/>
took him for another man. They're sorry, but they can't help it now."</q>
<q>"They're a-building him a monument," said Ham Sandwich, with <lb/>
the air of a person who had contributed to it, and knew.</q>
<q>"James Walker" drew a deep sigh&#x2014;evidently a sigh of relief&#x2014; <lb/>
and said nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his <lb/>
countenance cleared visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all <lb/>
went to our cabin, and the boys cooked him the best dinner the camp <lb/>
could furnish the materials for, and while they were about it Hillyer and <lb/>
I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of ours, and <lb/>
made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. "Old" is the <lb/>
right word, and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon <lb/>
his hair, and the marks which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; <lb/>
though he is only in his prime in the matter of years. While he ate, <lb/>
we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he found his voice <lb/>
at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I <lb/>
cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can.</q>
<q><smcap>the "wrong man's" story</smcap>.</q>
<q>It happened like this: I was in Denver. I had been there many <lb/>
years; sometimes I remember how many, sometimes I don't&#x2014;but it <lb/>
isn't any matter. All of a sudden I got a notice to leave, or I would <lb/>
be exposed for a horrible crime committed long before&#x2014;years and years <lb/>
before&#x2014;in the East.</q>
<q>I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin <lb/>
of mine of the same name. What should I better do? My head was <lb/>
<pb n="363"/>
all disordered by fear, and I didn't know. I was allowed very little <lb/>
time&#x2014;only one day, I think it was. I would be ruined if I was pub- <lb/>
lished, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said. <lb/>
It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake <lb/>
they are sorry, but it is too late,&#x2014;the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, <lb/>
you see. So I said I would sell out and get money to live on, and run <lb/>
away until it blew over and I could come back with my proofs. Then <lb/>
I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the mountains some- <lb/>
where, and lived disguised and had a false name.</q>
<q>I got more and more troubled and worried, and my troubles made <lb/>
me see spirits and hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear <lb/>
on any subject, but got confused and involved and had to give it up, <lb/>
because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and worse; more spirits <lb/>
and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in the <lb/>
night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my <lb/>
bed and plotting against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged <lb/>
out, because I got no good rest.</q>
<q>And then came the worst. One night the whispers said, "We'll <lb/>
never manage, because we can't <i>see</i> him, and so can't point him out to <lb/>
the people."</q>
<q>They sighed; then one said: "We must bring Sherlock Holmes. <lb/>
He can be here in twelve days."</q>
<q>They all agreed, and whispered and jibbered with joy. But my <lb/>
heart broke; for I had read about that man, and knew what it would <lb/>
be to have him upon my track, with his superhuman penetration and <lb/>
tireless energies.</q>
<q>The spirits went away to fetch him, and I got up at once in the <lb/>
middle of the night and fled away, carrying nothing but the hand-bag <lb/>
that had my money in it&#x2014;thirty thousand dollars; two-thirds of it are <lb/>
in the bag there yet. It was forty days before that man caught up on <lb/>
my track. I just escaped. From habit he had written his real name <lb/>
on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget <lb/>
Barclay" in the place of it. But fear gives you a watchful eye and <lb/>
keen, and I read the true name through the scratches, and fled like a <lb/>
deer.</q>
<q>He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a half&#x2014; <lb/>
the Pacific States, Australasia, India&#x2014;everywhere you can think of; <lb/>
then back to Mexico and up to California again, giving me hardly any <lb/>
rest; but that name on the registers always saved me, and what is left <lb/>
<pb n="364"/>
of me is alive yet. And I am <i>so</i> tired! A cruel time he has given me, <lb/>
yet I give you my honor I have never harmed him nor any man.</q>
<q>That was the end of the story, and it stirred those boys to blood- <lb/>
heat, be sure of it. As for me&#x2014;each word burnt a hole in me where <lb/>
it struck.</q>
<q>We voted that the old man should bunk with us, and be my guest <lb/>
and Hillyer's. I shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as <lb/>
he is well rested and nourished, I shall take him to Denver and rehabili- <lb/>
tate his fortunes.</q>
<q>The boys gave the old fellow the bone-mashing good-fellowship <lb/>
handshake of the mines, and then scattered away to spread the news.</q>
<q>At dawn next morning Wells-Fargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich <lb/>
called us softly out, and said, privately:</q>
<q>"That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has <lb/>
spread all around, and the camps are up. They are piling in from <lb/>
everywhere, and are going to lynch the P'fessor. Constable Harris is <lb/>
in a dead funk, and has telephoned the sheriff. Come along!"</q>
<q>We started on a run. The others were privileged to feel as they <lb/>
chose, but in my heart's privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in <lb/>
time; for I had small desire that Sherlock Holmes should hang for my <lb/>
deeds, as you can easily believe. I had heard a good deal about the <lb/>
sheriff, but for reassurance's sake I asked,</q>
<q>"Can he stop a mob?"</q>
<q>"Can <i>he</i> stop a mob! Can Jack <i>Fairfax</i> stop a mob! Well, I <lb/>
should smile! Ex-desperado&#x2014;nineteen scalps on his string. Can <i>he!</i> <lb/>
Oh, I <i>say!</i>"</q>
<q>As we tore up the gulch, distant cries and shouts and yells rose <lb/>
faintly on the still air, and grew steadily in strength as we raced along. <lb/>
Roar after roar burst out, stronger and stronger, nearer and nearer; and <lb/>
at last, when we closed up upon the multitude massed in the open area <lb/>
in front of the tavern, the crash of sound was deafening. Some brutal <lb/>
roughs from Daly's gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was the <lb/>
calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if <lb/>
any fear of death was in his British heart, his iron personality was <lb/>
master of it and no sign of it was allowed to appear.</q>
<q>"Come to a vote, men!" This from one of the Daly gang, Shad- <lb/>
belly Higgins. "Quick! is it hang, or shoot?"</q>
<q>"Neither!" shouted one of his comrades. "He'd be alive again <lb/>
in a week; burning's the only permanency for <i>him</i>."</q>
<pb n="365"/>
<q>The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thunder-crash <lb/>
of approval, and went struggling and surging toward the prisoner, and <lb/>
closed around him, shouting, "Fire! fire's the ticket!" They dragged <lb/>
him to the horse-post, backed him against it, chained him to it, and <lb/>
piled wood and pine cones around him waist-deep. Still the strong face <lb/>
did not blench, and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips.</q>
<q>"A match! fetch a match!"</q>
<q>Shadbelly struck it, shaded it with his hand, stooped, and held it <lb/>
under a pine cone. A deep silence fell upon the mob. The cone <lb/>
caught, a tiny flame flickered about it a moment or two. I seemed to <lb/>
catch the sound of distant hoofs&#x2014;it grew more distinct&#x2014;still more <lb/>
and more distinct, more and more definite, but the absorbed crowd did <lb/>
not appear to notice it. The match went out. The man struck another, <lb/>
stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to <lb/>
spread&#x2014;here and there men turned away their faces. The executioner <lb/>
stood with the charred match in his fingers, watching his work. The <lb/>
hoof-beats turned a projecting crag, and now they came thundering down <lb/>
upon us. Almost the next moment there was a shout&#x2014;</q>
<q>"The sheriff!"</q>
<q>And straightway he came tearing into the midst, stood his horse <lb/>
almost on his hind feet, and said,</q>
<q>"Fall back, you gutter-snipes!"</q>
<q>He was obeyed. By all but their leader. He stood his ground, <lb/>
and his hand went to his revolver. The sheriff covered him promptly, <lb/>
and said:</q>
<q>"Drop your hand, you parlor-desperado. Kick the fire away. <lb/>
Now unchain the stranger."</q>
<q>The parlor-desperado obeyed. Then the sheriff made a speech; <lb/>
sitting his horse at martial ease, and not warming his words with any <lb/>
touch of fire, but delivering them in a measured and deliberate way, and <lb/>
in a tone which harmonized with their character and made them impres- <lb/>
sively disrespectful.</q>
<q>"You're a nice lot&#x2014;now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel <lb/>
with this bilk here&#x2014;Shadbelly Higgins&#x2014;this loud-mouthed sneak that <lb/>
shoots people in the back and calls himself a desperado. If there's any- <lb/>
thing I do particularly despise, it's a lynching mob; I've never seen <lb/>
one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a hundred against one be- <lb/>
fore it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's made up <lb/>
of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine <lb/>
<pb n="366"/>
times out of a hundred the sheriff's another one." He paused&#x2014;appar- <lb/>
ently to turn that last idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it&#x2014; <lb/>
then he went on: "The sheriff that lets a mob take a prisoner away <lb/>
from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By the statistics there <lb/>
was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America <lb/>
last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there'll be a new disease <lb/>
in the doctor books&#x2014;<i>sheriff complaint</i>." That idea pleased him&#x2014; <lb/>
any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; <lb/>
got the same old thing.' And next there'll be a new title. People <lb/>
won't say, 'He's running for sheriff of Rapaho County,' for instance; <lb/>
they'll say, 'He's running for Coward of Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of <lb/>
a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!"</q>
<q>He turned an eye on the captive, and said, "Stranger, who are you, <lb/>
and what have you been doing?"</q>
<q>"My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I have not been doing any- <lb/>
thing."</q>
<q>It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name <lb/>
made on the sheriff, notwithstanding he must have come posted. He <lb/>
spoke up with feeling, and said it was a blot on the country that a man <lb/>
whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their fame and their <lb/>
ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every reader's heart by <lb/>
the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under <lb/>
the Stars and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the <lb/>
name of the whole nation, and made Holmes a most handsome bow, <lb/>
and told Constable Harris to see him to his quarters, and hold himself <lb/>
personally responsible if he was molested again. Then he turned to the <lb/>
mob and said:</q>
<q>"Hunt your holes, you scum!" which they did; then he said: <lb/>
"Follow me, Shadbelly; I'll take care of your case myself. No&#x2014;keep <lb/>
your pop-gun; whenever I see the day that I'll be afraid to have you be- <lb/>
hind me with that thing, it'll be time for me to join last year's hundred <lb/>
and eighty-two;" and he rode off in a walk, Shadbelly following.</q>
<q>When we were on our way back to our cabin, toward breakfast-time, <lb/>
we ran upon the news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lock-up <lb/>
in the night and is gone! Nobody is sorry. Let his uncle track him <lb/>
out if he likes; it is in his line; the camp is not interested.</q>
