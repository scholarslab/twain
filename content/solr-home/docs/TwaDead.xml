    <p>SCATTERED here and there through the stacks of unpublished manuscript which constitute this
     formidable Autobiography and Diary of mine, certain chapters will in some distant future be
     found which deal with "Claimants"&mdash;claimants historically notorious: Satan, Claimant; the
     Golden Calf, Claimant; the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, Claimant; Louis XVII., Claimant;
     William Shakespeare, Claimant; Arthur Orton, Claimant; Mary Baker G. Eddy, Claimant <pb n="2"/>
     &mdash;and the rest of them. Eminent Claimants, successful Claimants, defeated Claimants, royal
     Claimants, pleb Claimants, showy Claimants, shabby Claimants, revered Claimants, despised
     Claimants, twinkle starlike here and there and yonder through the mists of history and legend
     and tradition&mdash;and oh, all the darling tribe are clothed in mystery and romance, and we
     read about them with deep interest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorous
     resentment, according to which side we hitch ourselves to. It has always been so with the human
     race. There was never a Claimant that couldn't get a hearing, nor one that couldn't accumulate
     a rapturous following, no matter how flimsy and apparently unauthentic his claim might be.
     Arthur Orton's claim that he was the lost Tichborne baronet come to life again was as flimsy as
     Mrs. <pb n="3"/> Eddy's that she wrote <hi rend="italic">Science and Health</hi> from the
     direct dictation of the Deity; yet in England near forty years ago Orton had a huge army of
     devotees and incorrigible adherents, many of whom remained stubbornly unconvinced after their
     fat god had been proven an impostor and jailed as a perjurer, and to-day Mrs. Eddy's following
     is not only immense, but is daily augmenting in numbers and enthusiasm. Orton had many fine and
     educated minds among his adherents, Mrs. Eddy has had the like among hers from the beginning.
     Her church is as well equipped in those particulars as is any other church. Claimants can
     always count upon a following, it doesn't matter who they are, nor what they claim, nor whether
     they come with documents or without. It was always so. Down out of the long-vanished past,
     across the abyss of the ages, if you listen <pb n="4"/> you can still hear the believing
     multitudes shouting for Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel. </p>
    <p>A friend has sent me a new book, from England&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The Shakespeare Problem
      Restated</hi>&mdash;well restated and closely reasoned; and my fifty years' interest in that
     matter&mdash;asleep for the last three years&mdash;is excited once more. It is an interest
     which was born of Delia Bacon's book&mdash;away back in that ancient day&mdash;1857, or maybe
     1856. About a year later my pilot-master, Bixby, transferred me from his own steamboat to the
      <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania,</hi> and placed me under the orders and instructions of George
     Ealer&mdash;dead now, these many, many years. I steered for him a good many months&mdash;as was
     the humble duty of the pilot-apprentice: stood a daylight watch and spun the wheel under the
     severe superintendence and correction of the master. <pb n="5"/> He was a prime chess player
     and an idolater of Shakespeare. He would play chess with anybody; even with me, and it cost his
     official dignity something to do that. Also&mdash;quite uninvited&mdash;he would read
     Shakespeare to me; not just casually, but by the hour, when it was his watch, and I was
     steering. He read well, but not profitably for me, because he constantly injected commands into
     the text. That broke it all up, mixed it all up, tangled it all up&mdash;to that degree, in
     fact, that if we were in a risky and difficult piece of river an ignorant person couldn't have
     told, sometimes, which observations were Shakespeare's and which were Ealer's. For instance: </p>
    <p><q>What man dare, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> dare!</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>Approach thou <hi rend="italic">what</hi> are you laying in the leads for? what a hell of
      an idea! like the rugged ease her off a little, ease her off! rugged Russian bear, the armed
      rhinoceros <pb n="6"/> or the <hi rend="italic">there</hi> she goes! meet her, meet her!
      didn't you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> she'd smell the reef if you crowded it like that?
      Hyrcan tiger; take any shape but that and my firm nerves she'll be in the <hi rend="italic"
       >woods</hi> the first you know! stop the starboard! come ahead strong on the larboard! back
      the starboard! . . . <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> then, you're all right; come ahead on the
      starboard; straighten up and go 'long, never tremble: or be alive again, and dare me to the
      desert <hi rend="italic">damnation</hi> can't you keep away from that greasy water ? pull her
      down! snatch her! snatch her baldheaded! with thy sword; if trembling I inhabit then, lay in
      the leads!&mdash;no, only the starboard one, leave the other alone, protest me the baby of a
      girl. Hence horrible shadow! eight bells&mdash;that watchman's asleep again, I reckon, go down
      and call Brown yourself, unreal mockery, hence!"</q>
    </p>
    <p>He certainly was a good reader, and splendidly thrilling and stormy and tragic, but it was a
     damage to me, because I have never since been able to read Shakespeare in a calm and sane way.
      <pb n="7"/> I cannot rid it of his explosive interlardings, they break in everywhere with
     their irrelevant " What in hell are you up to <hi rend="italic">now!</hi> pull her down! more!
      <hi rend="italic">more!</hi>&mdash;there now, steady as you go," and the other disorganizing
     interruptions that were always leaping from his mouth. When I read Shakespeare now, I can hear
     them as plainly as I did in that long-departed time&mdash;fifty-one years ago. I never regarded
     Ealer's readings as educational. Indeed they were a detriment to me. </p>
    <p>His contributions to the text seldom improved it, but barring that detail he was a good
     reader, I can say that much for him. He did not use the book, and did not need to; he knew his
     Shakespeare as well as Euclid ever knew his multiplication table. </p>
    <p>Did he have something to say&mdash;this Shakespeare-adoring Mississippi pilot <pb n="8"
     />&mdash;anent Delia Bacon's book? Yes. And he said it; said it all the time, for
     months&mdash;in the morning watch, the middle watch, the dog watch; and probably kept it going
     in his sleep. He bought the literature of the dispute as fast as it appeared, and we discussed
     it all through thirteen hundred miles of river four times traversed in every thirty-five
     days&mdash;the time required by that swift boat to achieve two round trips. We discussed, and
     discussed, and discussed, and disputed and disputed and disputed; at any rate <hi rend="italic"
      >he</hi> did, and I got in a word now and then when he slipped a cog and there was a vacancy.
     He did his arguing with heat, with energy, with violence; and I did mine with the reserve and
     moderation of a subordinate who does not like to be flung out of a pilot-house that is perched
     forty feet above the water. He was fiercely loyal to Shakespeare and cordially <pb n="9"/>
     scornful of Bacon and of all the pretensions of the Baconians. So was I&mdash;at first. And at
     first he was glad that that was my attitude. There were even indications that he admired it;
     indications dimmed, it is true, by the distance that lay between the lofty boss-pilotical
     altitude and my lowly one, yet perceptible to me; perceptible, and translatable into a
     compliment&mdash;compliment coming down from above the snow-line and not well thawed in the
     transit, and not likely to set anything afire, not even a cub-pilot's self-conceit; still a
     detectable compliment, and precious. </p>
    <p>Naturally it flattered me into being more loyal to Shakespeare&mdash;if possible&mdash;than I
     was before, and more prejudiced against Bacon&mdash;if possible&mdash;than I was before. And so
     we discussed and discussed, both on the same side, and were happy. For a while. Only for a
     while. <pb n="10"/> Only for a very little while, a very, very, very little while. Then the
     atmosphere began to change; began to cool off. </p>
    <p>A brighter person would have seen what the trouble was, earlier than I did, perhaps, but I
     saw it early enough for all practical purposes. You see, he was of an argumentative
     disposition. Therefore it took him but a little time to get tired of arguing with a person who
     agreed with everything he said and consequently never furnished him a provocative to flare up
     and show what he could do when it came to clear, cold, hard, rose-cut, hundred-faceted,
     diamond-flashing <hi rend="italic">reasoning.</hi> That was his name for it. It has been
     applied since, with complacency, as many as several times, in the Bacon-Shakespeare scuffle. On
     the Shakespeare side. </p>
    <p>Then the thing happened which has happened to more persons than to me <pb n="11"/> when
     principle and personal interest found themselves in opposition to each other and a choice had
     to be made: I let principle go, and went over to the other side. Not the entire way, but far
     enough to answer the requirements of the case. That is to say, I took this attitude, to wit: I
     only <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> Bacon wrote Shakespeare, whereas I <hi rend="italic"
      >knew</hi> Shakespeare didn't. Ealer was satisfied with that, and the war broke loose. Study,
     practice, experience in handling my end of the matter presently enabled me to take my new
     position almost seriously; a little bit later, utterly seriously; a little later still,
     lovingly, gratefully, devotedly; finally: fiercely, rabidly, uncompromisingly. After that, I
     was welded to my faith, I was theoretically ready to die for it, and I looked down with
     compassion not unmixed with scorn, upon everybody else's faith that didn't <pb n="12"/> tally
     with mine. That faith, imposed upon me by self-interest in that ancient day, remains my faith
     to-day, and in it I find comfort, solace, peace, and never-failing joy. You see how curiously
     theological it is. The "rice Christian" of the Orient goes through the very same steps, when he
     is after rice and the missionary is after <hi rend="italic">him;</hi> he goes for rice, and
     remains to worship. </p>
    <p>Ealer did a lot of our "reasoning"&mdash;not to say substantially all of it. The slaves of
     his cult have a passion for calling it by that large name. We others do not call our inductions
     and deductions and reductions by any name at all. They show for themselves, what they are, and
     we can with tranquil confidence leave the world to ennoble them with a title of its own
     choosing. </p>
    <p>Now and then when Ealer had to stop to cough, I pulled my induction-talents <pb n="13"/>
     together and hove the controversial lead myself: always getting eight feet, eight-and-a-half,
     often nine, sometimes even quarter-less-twain&mdash;as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> believed; but
     always "no bottom," as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> said. </p>
    <p>I got the best of him only once. I prepared myself. I wrote out a passage from
     Shakespeare&mdash;it may have been the very one I quoted a while ago, I don't
     remember&mdash;and riddled it with his wild steamboatful interlardings. When an unrisky
     opportunity offered, one lovely summer day, when we had sounded and buoyed a tangled patch of
     crossings known as Hell's Half Acre, and were aboard again and he had sneaked the <hi
      rend="italic">Pennsylvania</hi> triumphantly through it without once scraping sand, and the
      <hi rend="italic">A. T. Lacey</hi> had followed in our wake and got stuck, and he was feeling
     good, I showed it to him. It amused him. I asked him to fire it off: <hi rend="italic"
      >read</hi> it; read it, <pb n="14"/> I diplomatically added, as only <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
     could read dramatic poetry. The compliment touched him where he lived. He did read it; read it
     with surpassing fire and spirit; read it as it will never be read again; for <hi rend="italic"
      >he</hi> knew how to put the right music into those thunderous interlardings and make them
     seem a part of the text, make them sound as if they were bursting from Shakespeare's own soul,
     each one of them a golden inspiration and not to be left out without damage to the massed and
     magnificent whole. </p>
    <p>I waited a week, to let the incident fade; waited longer; waited until he brought up for
     reasonings and vituperation my pet position, my pet argument, the one which I was fondest of,
     the one which I prized far above all others in my ammunition-wagon, to wit: that Shakespeare
     couldn't have written Shakespeare's works, for the reason that the <pb n="15"/> man who wrote
     them was limitlessly familiar with the laws, and the law-courts, and law-proceedings, and
     lawyer-talk, and lawyer-ways&mdash;and if Shakespeare was possessed of the infinitely-divided
     star-dust that constituted this vast wealth, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> did he get it, and <hi
      rend="italic">where,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">when?</hi>
    </p>
    <p>"From books." </p>
    <p>From books! That was always the idea. I answered as my readings of the champions of my side
     of the great controversy had taught me to answer: that a man can't handle glibly and easily and
     comfortably and successfully the <hi rend="italic">argot</hi> of a trade at which he has not
     personally served. He will make mistakes; he will not, and cannot, get the trade-phrasings
     precisely and exactly right; and the moment he departs, by even a shade, from a common
     trade-form, the reader who has served that trade will know the <pb n="16"/> writer <hi
      rend="italic">hasn't.</hi> Ealer would not be convinced; he said a man could learn how to
     correctly handle the subtleties and mysteries and free-masonries of <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
     trade by careful reading and studying. But when I got him to read again the passage from
     Shakespeare with the interlardings, he perceived, himself, that books couldn't teach a student
     a bewildering multitude of pilot-phrases so thoroughly and perfectly that he could talk them
     off in book and play or conversation and make no mistake that a pilot would not immediately
     discover. It was a triumph for me. He was silent awhile, and I knew what was happening: he was
     losing his temper. And I knew he would presently close the session with the same old argument
     that was always his stay and his support in time of need; the same old argument, the one I
     couldn't answer&mdash;because I dasn't: the argument that <pb n="17"/> I was an ass, and better
     shut up. He delivered it, and I obeyed. </p>
    <p>Oh, dear, how long ago it was&mdash;how pathetically long ago! And here am I, old, forsaken,
     forlorn and alone, arranging to get that argument out of somebody again. </p>
    <p>When a man has a passion for Shakespeare, it goes without saying that he keeps company with
     other standard authors. Ealer always had several high-class books in the pilot-house, and he
     read the same ones over and over again, and did not care to change to newer and fresher ones.
     He played well on the flute, and greatly enjoyed hearing himself play. So did I. He had a
     notion that a flute would keep its health better if you took it apart when it was not standing
     a watch; and so, when it was not on duty it took its rest, disjointed, on the compass-shelf
     under the breast-board. <pb n="18"/> When the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania</hi> blew up and

     among them), pilot Brown had the watch below, and was probably asleep and never knew what
     killed him; but Ealer escaped unhurt. He and his pilot-house were shot up into the air; then
     they fell, and Ealer sank through the ragged cavern where the hurricane deck and the boiler
     deck had been, and landed in a nest of ruins on the main deck, on top of one of the unexploded
     boilers, where he lay prone in a fog of scalding and deadly steam. But not for long. He did not
     lose his head: long familiarity with danger had taught him to keep it, in any and all
     emergencies. He held his coat-lapels to his nose with one hand, to keep out the steam, and
     scrabbled around with the other till he found the joints of his flute, then he <pb n="19"/>
     took measures to save himself alive, and was successful. I was not on board. I had been put
     ashore in New Orleans by Captain Klinefelter. The reason&mdash;however, I have told all about

    <head>II</head>

    <p>WHEN I was a Sunday-school scholar something more than sixty years ago, I became interested
     in Satan, and wanted to find out all I could about him. I began to ask questions, but my
     class-teacher, Mr. Barclay the stone-mason, was reluctant about answering them, it seemed to
     me. I was anxious to be praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects when there wasn't
     another boy in the village who could be hired to do such a thing. I was greatly interested in
     the incident of Eve and the serpent, and thought Eve's calmness was perfectly noble. I asked
     Mr. Barclay if he had ever heard of another woman who, being approached by a serpent, would <pb
      n="21"/> not excuse herself and break for the nearest timber. He did not answer my question,
     but rebuked me for inquiring into matters above my age and comprehension. I will say for Mr.
     Barclay that he was willing to tell me the facts of Satan's history, but he stopped there: he
     wouldn't allow any discussion of them. </p>
    <p>In the course of time we exhausted the facts. There were only five or six of them, you could
     set them all down on a visiting-card. I was disappointed. I had been meditating a biography,
     and was grieved to find that there were no materials. I said as much, with the tears running
     down. Mr. Barclay's sympathy and compassion were aroused, for he was a most kind and
     gentle-spirited man, and he patted me on the head and cheered me up by saying there was a whole
     vast ocean of materials! I can <pb n="22"/> still feel the happy thrill which these blessed
     words shot through me. </p>
    <p>Then he began to bail out that ocean's riches for my encouragement and joy. Like this: it was
     "conjectured"&mdash;though not established&mdash;that Satan was originally an angel in heaven;
     that he fell; that he rebelled, and brought on a war; that he was defeated, and banished to
     perdition. Also, "we have reason to believe" that later he did so-and-so; that "we are
     warranted in supposing"that at a subsequent time he travelled extensively, seeking whom he
     might devour; that a couple of centuries afterward, "as tradition instructs us," he took up the
     cruel trade of tempting people to their ruin, with vast and fearful results; that by-and-by,
     "as the probabilities seem to indicate," he may have done certain things, he might have done
     certain other things, he must have done still other things. <pb n="23"/>
    </p>
    <p>And so on and so on. We set down the five known facts by themselves, on a piece of paper, and
     numbered it "page 1"; then on fifteen hundred other pieces of paper we set down the
     "conjectures," and "suppositions," and "maybes," and "perhapses," and "doubtlesses," and
     "rumors," and "guesses," and "probabilities," and "likelihoods," and "we are permitted to
     thinks," and "we are warranted in believings," and "might have beens," and "could have beens,"
     and "must have beens," and "unquestionablys," and "without a shadow of doubts"&mdash;and
     behold! </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Materials?</hi> Why, we had enough to build a biography of Shakespeare! </p>
    <p>Yet he made me put away my pen; he would not let me write the history of Satan. Why? Because,
     as he said, he had suspicions; suspicions that my attitude in this matter was not reverent; <pb
      n="24"/> and that a person must be reverent when writing about the sacred characters. He said
     any one who spoke flippantly of Satan would be frowned upon by the religious world and also be
     brought to account. </p>
    <p>I assured him, in earnest and sincere words, that he had wholly misconceived my attitude;
     that I had the highest respect for Satan, and that my reverence for him equalled, and possibly
     even exceeded, that of any member of any church. I said it wounded me deeply to perceive by his
     words that he thought I would make fun of Satan, and deride him, laugh at him, scoff at him:
     whereas in truth I had never thought of such a thing, but had only a warm desire to make fun of
     those others and laugh at <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> "What others?" "Why, the Supposers, the
     Perhapsers, the Might-Have-Beeners, the Could-Have-Beeners, the <pb n="25"/> Must-Have-Beeners,
     the Without-a-Shadow-of-Doubters, the We-are-Warranted-in-Believingers, and all that funny crop
     of solemn architects who have taken a good solid foundation of five indisputable and
     unimportant facts and built upon it a Conjectural Satan thirty miles high." </p>
    <p>What did Mr. Barclay do then? Was he disarmed? Was he silenced? No. He was shocked. He was so
     shocked that he visibly shuddered. He said the Satanic Traditioners and Perhapsers and
     Conjecturers were <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> sacred! As sacred as their work. So sacred
     that whoso ventured to mock them or make fun of their work, could not afterward enter any
     respectable house, even by the back door. </p>
    <p>How true were his words, and how wise! How fortunate it would have been for me if I had
     heeded them. But I was <pb n="26"/> young, I was but seven years of age, and vain, foolish, and
     anxious to attract attention. I wrote the biography, and have never been in a respectable house
     since.</p>

     <p>How curious and interesting is the parallel&mdash;as far as poverty of biographical details
      is concerned&mdash;between Satan and Shakespeare. It is wonderful, it is unique, it stands
      quite alone, there is nothing resembling it in history, nothing resembling it in romance,
      nothing approaching it even in tradition. How sublime is their position, and how over-topping,
      how sky-reaching, how supreme&mdash;the two Great Unknowns, the two Illustrious

     <p>He was born on the 23d of April, 1564. </p>
     <p>Of good farmer-class parents who could not read, could not write, could not sign their
      names. </p>
     <p>At Stratford, a small back settlement which in that day was shabby and unclean, and densely
      illiterate. Of the nineteen important men charged with the government of the town, thirteen
      had to "make their mark" in attesting important documents, because they could not write their
      names. </p>
     <p>Of the first eighteen years of his life <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> is known. They are a
      blank. </p>
     <p>On the 27th of November (1582) William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne
      Whateley. <pb n="29"/>
     </p>
     <p>Next day William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne Hathaway. She was eight years
      his senior. </p>
     <p>William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway. In a hurry. By grace of a reluctantly-granted
      dispensation there was but one publication of the banns. </p>
     <p>Within six months the first child was born. </p>
     <p>About two (blank) years followed, during which period <hi rend="italic">nothing at all
       happened to Shakespeare,</hi> so far as anybody knows. </p>
     <p>Then came twins&mdash;1585. February. </p>
     <p>Two blank years follow. </p>
     <p>Then&mdash;1587&mdash;he makes a ten-year visit to London, leaving the family behind. </p>
     <p>Five blank years follow. During this period <hi rend="italic">nothing happened to him,</hi>
      as far as anybody actually knows. </p>
     <p>Then&mdash;1592&mdash;there is mention of him as an actor. <pb n="30"/>
     </p>
     <p>Next year&mdash;1593&mdash;his name appears in the official list of players. </p>
     <p>Next year&mdash;1594&mdash;he played before the queen. A detail of no consequence: other
      obscurities did it every year of the forty-five of her reign. And remained obscure. </p>
     <p>Three pretty full years follow. Full of play-acting. Then </p>
     <p>In 1597 he bought New Place, Stratford. </p>
     <p>Thirteen or fourteen busy years follow; years in which he accumulated money, and also
      reputation as actor and manager. </p>
     <p>Meantime his name, liberally and variously spelt, had become associated with a number of
      great plays and poems, as (ostensibly) author of the same. </p>
     <p>Some of these, in these years and later, were pirated, but he made no protest. </p>
     <p>Then&mdash;1610-1611&mdash;he returned to Stratford and settled down for good and all, <pb
       n="31"/> and busied himself in lending money, trading in tithes, trading in land and houses;
      shirking a debt of forty-one shillings, borrowed by his wife during his long desertion of his
      family; suing debtors for shillings and coppers; being sued himself for shillings and coppers;
      and acting as confederate to a neighbor who tried to rob the town of its rights in a certain
      common, and did not succeed. </p>
     <p>He lived five or six years&mdash;till 1616&mdash;in the joy of these elevated pursuits. Then
      he made a will, and signed each of its three pages with his name. </p>
     <p>A thoroughgoing business man's will. It named in minute detail every item of property he
      owned in the world&mdash;houses, lands, sword, silver-gilt bowl, and so on&mdash;all the way
      down to his "second-best bed" and its furniture. </p>
     <p>It carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among the members of <pb n="32"/> his
      family, overlooking no individual of it. Not even his wife: the wife he had been enabled to
      marry in a hurry by urgent grace of a special dispensation before he was nineteen; the wife
      whom he had left husbandless so many years; the wife who had had to borrow forty-one shillings
      in her need, and which the lender was never able to collect of the prosperous husband, but
      died at last with the money still lacking. No, even this wife was remembered in Shakespeare's
      will. </p>
     <p>He left her that "second-best bed." </p>
     <p>And <hi rend="italic">not another thing;</hi> not even a penny to bless her lucky widowhood
      with. </p>
     <p>It was eminently and conspicuously a business man's will, not a poet's. </p>
     <p>It mentioned <hi rend="italic">not a single book.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>Books were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt bowls and second-best <pb n="33"/>
      beds in those days, and when a departing person owned one he gave it a high place in his will. </p>
     <p>The will mentioned <hi rend="italic">not a play, not a poem, not an unfinished literary
       work, not a scrap of manuscript of any kind.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>Many poets have died poor, but this is the only one in history that has died <hi
       rend="italic">this</hi> poor; the others all left literary remains behind. Also a book. Maybe
      two. </p>
     <p>If Shakespeare had owned a dog&mdash;but we need not go into that: we know he would have
      mentioned it in his will. If a good dog, Susanna would have got it; if an inferior one his
      wife would have got a dower interest in it. I wish he had had a dog, just so we could see how
      painstakingly he would have divided that dog among the family, in his careful business way. </p>
     <p>He signed the will in three places. <pb n="34"/>
     </p>
     <p>In earlier years he signed two other official documents. </p>
     <p>These five signatures still exist. </p>
     <p>There are <hi rend="italic">no other specimens of his penmanship in existence.</hi> Not a
      line. </p>
     <p>Was he prejudiced against the art? His granddaughter, whom he loved, was eight years old
      when he died, yet she had had no teaching, he left no provision for her education although he
      was rich, and in her mature womanhood she couldn't write and couldn't tell her husband's
      manuscript from anybody else's&mdash;she thought it was Shakespeare's. </p>
     <p>When Shakespeare died in Stratford <hi rend="italic">it was not an event.</hi> It made no
      more stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theater-actor would have made.
      Nobody came down from London; there were no lamenting poems, no eulogies, no national
      tears&mdash;there was merely silence, and nothing more. A striking <pb n="35"/> contrast with
      what happened when Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon, and Spenser, and Raleigh and the other
      distinguished literary folk of Shakespeare's time passed from life! No praiseful voice was
      lifted for the lost Bard of Avon; even Ben Jonson waited seven years before he lifted his. </p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">So far as anybody actually knows and can prove,</hi> Shakespeare of
      Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life. </p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">So far as anybody knows and can prove,</hi> he never wrote a letter to
      anybody in his life. </p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">So far as any one knows, he received only one letter during his life.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>So far as any one <hi rend="italic">knows and can prove,</hi> Shakespeare of Stratford wrote
      only one poem during his life. This one is authentic. He did write that one&mdash;a fact which
      stands undisputed; he wrote the whole of it; he wrote the whole of it out <pb n="36"/> of his
      own head. He commanded that this work of art be engraved upon his tomb, and he was obeyed.
      There it abides to this day. This is it:</p>

    <head>IV<lb/> Conjectures<lb/>
    </head>

    <p>THE historians "suppose" that Shakespeare attended the Free School in Stratford from the time
     he was seven years old till he was thirteen. There is no <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> in
     existence that he ever went to school at all. </p>
    <p>The historians "infer" that he got his Latin in that school&mdash;the school which they
     "suppose" he attended. </p>
    <p>They "suppose" his father's declining fortunes made it necessary for him to leave the school
     they supposed he attended, and get to work and help support his parents and their ten children.
     But there is no evidence that he ever <pb n="38"/>entered or retired from the school they
     suppose he attended. </p>
    <p>They "suppose" he assisted his father in the butchering business; and that, being only a boy,
     he didn't have to do full-grown butchering, but only slaughtered calves. Also, that whenever he
     killed a calf he made a high-flown speech over it. This supposition rests upon the testimony of
     a man who wasn't there at the time; a man who got it from a man who could have been there, but
     did not say whether he was or not; and neither of them thought to mention it for decades, and
     decades, and decades, and two more decades after Shakespeare's death (until old age and mental
     decay had refreshed and vivified their memories). They hadn't two facts in stock about the
     long-dead distinguished citizen, but only just the one: he slaughtered calves and broke into
     oratory while he <pb n="39"/> was at it. Curious. They had only one fact, yet the distinguished
     citizen had spent twenty-six years in that little town&mdash;just half his lifetime. However,
     rightly viewed, it was the most important fact, indeed almost the only important fact, of
     Shakespeare's life in Stratford. Rightly viewed. For experience is an author's most valuable
     asset; experience is the thing that puts the muscle and the breath and the warm blood into the
     book he writes. Rightly viewed, calf-butchering accounts for <hi rend="italic">Titus
      Andronicus,</hi> the only play&mdash;ain't it?&mdash;that the Stratford Shakespeare ever
     wrote; and yet it is the only one everybody tries to chouse him out of, the Baconians included. </p>
    <p>The historians find themselves "justified in believing" that the young Shakespeare poached
     upon Sir Thomas Lucy's deer preserves and got haled before that magistrate for it. But there
      <pb n="40"/> is no shred of respectworthy evidence that anything of the kind happened. </p>
    <p>The historians, having argued the thing that <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have happened into
     the thing that <hi rend="italic">did</hi> happen, found no trouble in turning Sir Thomas Lucy
     into Mr. Justice Shallow. They have long ago convinced the world&mdash;on surmise and without
     trust-worthy evidence&mdash;that Shallow <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Sir Thomas. </p>
    <p>The next addition to the young Shakespeare's Stratford history comes easy. The historian
     builds it out of the surmised deer-stealing, and the surmised trial before the magistrate, and
     the surmised vengeance-prompted satire upon the magistrate in the play: result, the young
     Shakespeare was a wild, wild, wild, oh <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a wild young scamp, and that
     gratuitous slander is established for all time! It is the very way Professor Osborn and I built
     the colossal skeleton <pb n="41"/> brontosaur that stands fifty-seven feet long and sixteen
     feet high in the Natural History Museum, the awe and admiration of all the world, the
     stateliest skeleton that exists on the planet. We had nine bones, and we built the rest of him
     out of plaster of paris. We ran short of plaster of paris, or we'd have built a brontosaur that
     could sit down beside the Stratford Shakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was
     biggest or contained the most plaster. </p>
    <p>Shakespeare pronounced <hi rend="italic">Venus and Adonis</hi> "the first heir of his
     invention," apparently implying that it was his first effort at literary composition. He should
     not have said it. It has been an embarrassment to his historians these many, many years. They
     have to make him write that graceful and polished and flawless and beautiful poem before he
     escaped from Stratford and his family <pb n="42"/> &mdash;1586 or '87&mdash;age, twenty-two, or
     along there; because within the next five years he wrote five great plays, and could not have
     found time to write another line. </p>
    <p>It is sorely embarrassing. If he began to slaughter calves, and poach deer, and rollick
     around, and learn English, at the earliest likely moment&mdash;say at thirteen, when he was
     supposably wrenched from that school where he was supposably storing up Latin for future
     literary use&mdash;he had his youthful hands full, and much more than full. He must have had to
     put aside his Warwickshire dialect, which wouldn't be understood in London, and study English
     very hard. Very hard indeed; incredibly hard, almost, if the result of that labor was to be the
     smooth and rounded and flexible and letter-perfect English of the <hi rend="italic">Venus and
      Adonis</hi> in the space of ten years; and at the same <pb n="43"/> time learn great and fine
     and unsurpassable literary <hi rend="italic">form.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>However, it is "conjectured" that he accomplished all this and more, much more: learned law
     and its intricacies; and the complex procedure of the law courts; and all about soldiering, and
     sailoring, and the manners and customs and ways of royal courts and aristocratic society; and
     likewise accumulated in his one head every kind of knowledge the learned then possessed, and
     every kind of humble knowledge possessed by the lowly and the ignorant; and added thereto a
     wider and more intimate knowledge of the world's great literatures, ancient and modern, than
     was possessed by any other man of his time&mdash;for he was going to make brilliant and easy
     and admiration-compelling use of these splendid treasures the moment he got to London. And
     according <pb n="44"/> to the surmises, that is what he did. Yes, although there was no one in
     Stratford able to teach him these things, and no library in the little village to dig them out
     of. His father could not read, and even the surmises surmise that he did not keep a library. </p>
    <p>It is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare got his vast knowledge of the
     law and his familiar and accurate acquaintance with the manners and customs and shop-talk of
     lawyers through being for a time the <hi rend="italic">clerk of a Stratford court;</hi> just as
     a bright lad like me, reared in a village on the banks of the Mississippi, might become perfect
     in knowledge of the Bering Strait whale-fishery and the shop-talk of the veteran exercisers of
     that adventure-bristling trade through catching catfish with a "trot-line" Sundays. But the
     surmise is damaged by the fact that there is no <pb n="45"/> evidence&mdash;and not even
     tradition&mdash;that the young Shakespeare was ever clerk of a law court. </p>
    <p>It is further surmised that the young Shakespeare accumulated his law-treasures in the first
     years of his sojourn in London, through "amusing himself" by learning book-law in his garret
     and by picking up lawyer-talk and the rest of it through loitering about the law-courts and
     listening. But it is only surmise; there is no <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> that he ever did
     either of those things. They are merely a couple of chunks of plaster of paris. </p>
    <p>There is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holding horses in front of the London
     theaters, mornings and afternoons. Maybe he did. If he did, it seriously shortened his
     law-study hours and his recreation-time in the courts. In those very days he was writing great
     plays, and needed all the time he could <pb n="46"/> get. The horse-holding legend ought to be
     strangled; it too formidably increases the historian's difficulty in accounting for the young
     Shakespeare's erudition&mdash;an erudition which he was acquiring, hunk by hunk and chunk by
     chunk every day in those strenuous times, and emptying each day's catch into next day's
     imperishable drama. </p>
    <p>He had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time; and a knowledge of soldier-people and
     sailor-people and their ways and talk; also a knowledge of some foreign lands and their
     languages: for he was daily emptying fluent streams of these various knowledges, too, into his
     dramas. How did he acquire these rich assets? </p>
    <p>In the usual way: by surmise. It is <hi rend="italic">surmised</hi> that he travelled in
     Italy and Germany and around, and qualified himself to put their scenic and social aspects <pb
      n="47"/> upon paper; that he perfected himself in French, Italian and Spanish on the road;
     that he went in Leicester's expedition to the Low Countries, as soldier or sutler or something,
     for several months or years&mdash;or whatever length of time a surmiser needs in his
     business&mdash;and thus became familiar with soldiership and soldier-ways and soldier-talk, and
     generalship and general-ways and general-talk, and seamanship and sailor-ways and sailor-talk. </p>
    <p>Maybe he did all these things, but I would like to know who held the horses in the meantime;
     and who studied the books in the garret; and who frolicked in the law-courts for recreation.
     Also, who did the call-boying and the play-acting. </p>
    <p>For he became a call-boy; and as early as '93 he became a "vagabond"&mdash;the law's ungentle
     term for an unlisted <pb n="48"/> actor; and in '94 a "regular" and properly and officially
     listed member of that (in those days) lightly-valued and not much respected profession. </p>
    <p>Right soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theaters, and manager of them.
     Thenceforward he was a busy and flourishing business man, and was raking in money with both
     hands for twenty years. Then in a noble frenzy of poetic inspiration he wrote his one
     poem&mdash;his only poem, his darling&mdash;and laid him down and died:</p>

    <lg type="verse">
     <l>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare </l>
     <l>To digg the dust encloased heare: </l>
     <l>Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones </l>
     <l>And curst be he yt moves my bones.</l>
    </lg>

    <p>He was probably dead when he wrote it. Still, this is only conjecture. We have only
     circumstantial evidence. Internal evidence. <pb n="49"/>
    </p>
    <p>Shall I set down the rest of the Conjectures which constitute the giant Biography of William
     Shakespeare? It would strain the Unabridged Dictionary to hold them. He is a Brontosaur: nine
     bones and six hundred barrels of plaster of paris.</p>

    <head>V<lb/> "We May Assume"<lb/>
    </head>

    <p>IN the Assuming trade three separate and independent cults are transacting business. Two of
     these cults are known as the Shakespearites and the Baconians, and I am the other one&mdash;the
     Brontosaurian. </p>
    <p>The Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's Works; the Baconian knows that
     Francis Bacon wrote them; the Brontosaurian doesn't really know which of them did it, but is
     quite composedly and contentedly sure that Shakespeare <hi rend="italic">didn't,</hi> and
     strongly suspects that Bacon <hi rend="italic">did.</hi> We all have to do a good deal of
     assuming, but I am <pb n="51"/> fairly certain that in every case I can call to mind the
     Baconian assumers have come out ahead of the Shakespearites. Both parties handle the same
     materials, but the Baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and rational and persuasive
     results out of them than is the case with the Shakespearites. The Shakespearite conducts his
     assuming upon a definite principle, an unchanging and immutable law&mdash;which is: 2 and 8 and
     7 and 14, added together, make 165. I believe this to be an error. No matter, you cannot get a
     habit-sodden Shakespearite to cipher-up his materials upon any other basis. With the Baconian
     it is different. If you place before him the above figures and set him to adding them up, he
     will never in any case get more than 45 out of them, and in nine cases out of ten he will get
     just the proper 31. <pb n="52"/>
    </p>
    <p>Let me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and homely way calculated to bring the
     idea within the grasp of the ignorant and unintelligent. We will suppose a case: take a
     lap-bred, house-fed, uneducated, inexperienced kitten; take a rugged old Tom that's scarred
     from stem to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuous experience, and is so cultured, so
     educated, so limitlessly erudite that one may say of him "all cat-knowledge is his province";
     also, take a mouse. Lock the three up in a holeless, crackless, exitless prison-cell. Wait half
     an hour, then open the cell, introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian, and let them cipher and
     assume. The mouse is missing: the question to be decided is, where is it? You can guess both
     verdicts beforehand. One verdict will say the kitten contains the mouse; the other will as
     certainly say the mouse is in the tomcat. <pb n="53"/>
    </p>
    <p>The Shakespearite will Reason like this&mdash;(that is not my word, it is his). He will say
     the kitten <hi rend="italic">may have been</hi> attending school when nobody was noticing;
     therefore <hi rend="italic">we are warranted in assuming</hi> that it did so; also, it <hi
      rend="italic">could have been</hi> training in a court-clerk's office when no one was
     noticing; since that could have happened, <hi rend="italic">we are justified in assuming</hi>
     that it did happen; it <hi rend="italic">could have studied catology in a garret</hi> when no
     one was noticing&mdash;therefore it <hi rend="italic">did;</hi> it <hi rend="italic">could
      have</hi> attended cat-assizes on the shed-roof nights, for recreation, when no one was
     noticing, and harvested a knowledge of cat court-forms and cat lawyer-talk in that way: it <hi
      rend="italic">could</hi> have done it, therefore without a doubt it <hi rend="italic"
      >did;</hi> it <hi rend="italic">could have</hi> gone soldiering with a war-tribe when no one
     was noticing, and learned soldier-wiles and soldier-ways, and what to do with a mouse when
     opportunity offers; <pb n="54"/> the plain inference, therefore is, that that is what it <hi
      rend="italic">did.</hi> Since all these manifold things <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have
     occurred, we have <hi rend="italic">every right to believe</hi> they did occur. These patiently
     and painstakingly accumulated vast acquirements and competences needed but one thing
     more&mdash;opportunity&mdash;to convert themselves into triumphant action. The opportunity
     came, we have the result; <hi rend="italic">beyond shadow of question</hi> the mouse is in the
     kitten. </p>
    <p>It is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a <hi rend="italic">"We think we
      may assume,"</hi> we expect it, under careful watering and fertilizing and tending, to grow up
     into a strong and hardy and weather-defying <hi rend="italic">"there isn't a shadow of a
      doubt"</hi> at last&mdash;and it usually happens. </p>
    <p>We know what the Baconian's verdict would be: <hi rend="italic">"There is not a rag of
      evidence that the kitten has had any training, any education, any experience qualifying it for
       <pb n="55"/> the present occasion, or is indeed equipped for any achievement above lifting
      such unclaimed milk as comes its way; but there is abundant evidence&mdash;unassailable proof,
      in fact&mdash;that the other animal is equipped, to the last detail, with every qualification
      necessary for the event. Without shadow of doubt the tomcat contains the mouse."</hi></p>

    <head>VI </head>

    <p>WHEN Shakespeare died, in 1616, the great literary productions attributed to him as author
     had been before the London world and in high favor for twenty-four years. Yet his death was not
     an event. It made no stir, it attracted no attention. Apparently his eminent literary
     contemporaries did not realize that a celebrated poet had passed from their midst. Perhaps they
     knew a play-actor of minor rank had disappeared, but did not regard him as the author of his
     Works. "We are justified in assuming" this. </p>
    <p>His death was not even an event in the little town of Stratford. Does this mean <pb n="57"/>
     that in Stratford he was not regarded as a celebrity of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind? </p>
    <p>"We are privileged to assume"&mdash;no, we are indeed <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to
     assume&mdash;that such was the case. He had spent the first twenty-two or twenty-three years of
     his life there, and of course knew everybody and was known by everybody of that day in the
     town, including the dogs and the cats and the horses. He had spent the last five or six years
     of his life there, diligently trading in every big and little thing that had money in it; so we
     are compelled to assume that many of the folk there in those said latter days knew him
     personally, and the rest by sight and hearsay. But not as a <hi rend="italic">celebrity?</hi>
     Apparently not. For everybody soon forgot to remember any contact with him or any incident
     connected with him. The dozens of townspeople, still alive, who had known of him or known <pb
      n="58"/> about him in the first twenty-three years of his life were in the same unremembering
     condition: if they knew of any incident connected with that period of his life they didn't tell
     about it. Would they if they had been asked? It is most likely. Were they asked? It is pretty
     apparent that they were not. Why weren't they? It is a very plausible guess that nobody there
     or elsewhere was interested to know. </p>
    <p>For seven years after Shakespeare's death nobody seems to have been interested in him. Then
     the quarto was published, and Ben Jonson awoke out of his long indifference and sang a song of
     praise and put it in the front of the book. Then silence fell <hi rend="italic">again.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>For sixty years. Then inquiries into Shakespeare's Stratford life began to be made, of
     Stratfordians. Of Stratfordians who had known Shakespeare or had seen <pb n="59"/> him? No.
     Then of Stratfordians who had seen people who had known or seen people who had seen
     Shakespeare? No. Apparently the inquiries were only made of Stratfordians who were not
     Stratfordians of Shakespeare's day, but later comers; and what they had learned had come to
     them from persons who had not seen Shakespeare; and what they had learned was not claimed as
      <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi> but only as legend&mdash;dim and fading and indefinite legend;
     legend of the calf-slaughtering rank, and not worth remembering either as history or fiction. </p>
    <p>Has it ever happened before&mdash;or since&mdash;that a celebrated person who had spent
     exactly half of a fairly long life in the village where he was born and reared, was able to
     slip out of this world and leave that village voiceless and gossipless behind him&mdash;utterly
     voiceless, utterly gossipless? And permanently so? <pb n="60"/>
    </p>
    <p>I don't believe it has happened in any case except Shakespeare's. And couldn't and wouldn't
     have happened in his case if he had been regarded as a celebrity at the time of his death. </p>
    <p>When I examine my own case&mdash;but let us do that, and see if it will not be recognizable
     as exhibiting a condition of things quite likely to result, most likely to result, indeed
     substantially <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> to result in the case of a celebrated person, a
     benefactor of the human race. Like me. </p>
    <p>My parents brought me to the village of Hannibal, Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi,
     when I was two and a half years old. I entered school at five years of age, and drifted from
     one school to another in the village during nine and a half years. Then my father died, leaving
     his family in exceedingly straitened circumstances; wherefore my book education came to a
     standstill forever, <pb n="61"/> and I became a printer's apprentice, on board and clothes, and
     when the clothes failed I got a hymn-book in place of them. This for summer wear, probably. I
     lived in Hannibal fifteen and a half years, altogether, then ran away, according to the custom
     of persons who are intending to become celebrated. I never lived there afterward. Four years
     later I became a "cub" on a Mississippi steamboat in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade, and
     after a year and a half of hard study and hard work the U. S. inspectors rigorously examined me
     through a couple of long sittings and decided that I knew every inch of the
     Mississippi&mdash;thirteen hundred miles&mdash;in the dark and in the day&mdash;as well as a
     baby knows the way to its mother's paps day or night. So they licensed me as a
     pilot&mdash;knighted me, so to speak&mdash;and I rose up clothed with authority, a <pb n="62"/>
     responsible servant of the United States government. </p>
    <p>Now then. Shakespeare died young&mdash;he was only fifty-two. He had lived in his native
     village twenty-six years, or about that. He died celebrated (if you believe everything you read
     in the books). Yet when he died nobody there or elsewhere took any notice of it; and for sixty
     years afterward no townsman remembered to say anything about him or about his life in
     Stratford. When the inquirer came at last he got but one fact&mdash;no, <hi rend="italic"
      >legend</hi>&mdash;and got that one at second hand, from a person who had only heard it as a
     rumor, and didn't claim copyright in it as a production of his own. He couldn't, very well, for
     its date antedated his own birth-date. But necessarily a number of persons were still alive in
     Stratford who, in the days of their youth, had seen Shakespeare nearly <pb n="63"/> every day
     in the last five years of his life, and they would have been able to tell that inquirer some
     first-hand things about him if he had in those last days been a celebrity and therefore a
     person of interest to the villagers. Why did not the inquirer hunt them up and interview them?
     Wasn't it worth while? Wasn't the matter of sufficient consequence? Had the inquirer an
     engagement to see a dog-fight and couldn't spare the time? </p>
    <p>It all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity, there or elsewhere, and no
     considerable repute as actor and manager. </p>
    <p>Now then, I am away along in life&mdash;my seventy-third year being already well behind
     me&mdash;yet <hi rend="italic">sixteen</hi> of my Hannibal schoolmates are still alive to-day,
     and can tell&mdash;and do tell&mdash;inquirers dozens and dozens of incidents of their <pb
      n="64"/> young lives and mine together; things that happened to us in the morning of life, in
     the blossom of our youth, in the good days, the dear days,"the days when we went gipsying, a
     long time ago." Most of them creditable to me, too. One child to whom I paid court when she was
     five years old and I eight still lives in Hannibal, and she visited me last summer, traversing
     the necessary ten or twelve hundred miles of railroad without damage to her patience or to her
     old-young vigor. Another little lassie to whom I paid attention in Hannibal when she was nine
     years old and I the same, is still alive in London and hale and hearty, just as I am. And on
     the few surviving steamboats&mdash;those lingering ghosts and remembrancers of great fleets
     that plied the big river in the beginning of my water-career&mdash;which is exactly as long ago
     as the whole invoice <pb n="65"/> of the life-years of Shakespeare number&mdash;there are still
     findable two or three river-pilots who saw me do creditable things in those ancient days; and
     several white-headed engineers; and several roustabouts and mates; and several deckhands who
     used to heave the lead for me and send up on the still night air the
     "six&mdash;feet&mdash;scant!" that made me shudder, and the "M-a-r-k&mdash;<hi rend="italic"
      >twain!"</hi> that took the shudder away, and presently the darling "By the d-e-e-p&mdash;<hi
      rend="italic">four!"</hi> that lifted me to heaven for joy.<ref target="n6.1">[1]</ref> They
     know about me, and can tell. And so do printers, from St. Louis to New York; and so do
     newspaper reporters, from Nevada to San Francisco. And so do the police. If Shakespeare had
     really been celebrated, like me, Stratford could have told things about him; and if my
     experience goes for anything, they'd have done it.</p>

    <head>VII </head>

    <p>IF I had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to decide whether Shakespeare wrote
     Shakespeare or not, I believe I would place before the debaters only the one question, <hi
      rend="italic">Was Shakespeare ever a practicing lawyer?</hi> and leave everything else out. </p>
    <p>It is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not merely myriad-minded, but also
     myriad-accomplished: that he not only knew some thousands of things about human life in all its
     shades and grades, and about the hundred arts and trades and crafts and professions which men
     busy themselves in, but that he could <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> about the men and their
     grades and trades accurately, <pb n="67"/> making no mistakes. Maybe it is so, but have the
     experts spoken, or is it only Tom, Dick, and Harry? Does the exhibit stand upon wide, and
     loose, and eloquent generalizing&mdash;which is not evidence, and not proof&mdash;or upon
     details, particulars, statistics, illustrations, demonstrations? </p>
    <p>Experts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely as to only one of
     Shakespeare's multifarious craft-equipments, so far as my recollections of Shakespeare-Bacon
     talk abide with me&mdash;his law-equipment. I do not remember that Wellington or Napoleon ever
     examined Shakespeare's battles and sieges and strategies, and then decided and established for
     good and all, that they were militarily flawless; I do not remember that any Nelson, or Drake
     or Cook ever examined his seamanship and said it showed profound and accurate <pb n="68"/>
     familiarity with that art; I don't remember that any king or prince or duke has ever testified
     that Shakespeare was letter-perfect in his handling of royal court-manners and the talk and
     manners of aristocracies; I don't remember that any illustrious Latinist or Grecian or
     Frenchman or Spaniard or Italian has proclaimed him a past-master in those languages; I don't
     remember&mdash;well, I don't remember that there is <hi rend="italic"
     >testimony</hi>&mdash;great testimony&mdash;imposing testimony&mdash;unanswerable and
     unattackable testimony as to any of Shakespeare's hundred specialties, except one&mdash;the
     law. </p>
    <p>Other things change, with time, and the student cannot trace back with certainty the changes
     that various trades and their processes and technicalities have undergone in the long stretch
     of a century or two and find out what their processes and technicalities were in those <pb
      n="69"/> early days, but with the law it is different: it is mile-stoned and documented all
     the way back, and the master of that wonderful trade, that complex and intricate trade, that
     awe-compelling trade, has competent ways of knowing whether Shakespeare-law is good law or not;
     and whether his law-court procedure is correct or not, and whether his legal shop-talk is the
     shop-talk of a veteran practitioner or only a machine-made counterfeit of it gathered from
     books and from occasional loiterings in Westminster. </p>
    <p>Richard H. Dana served two years before the mast, and had every experience that falls to the
     lot of the sailor before the mast of our day. His sailor-talk flows from his pen with the sure
     touch and the ease and confidence of a person who has <hi rend="italic">lived</hi> what he is
     talking about, not gathered it from books and random listenings. Hear him: <pb n="70"/>
     <q>Having hove short, cast off the gaskets, and made the bunt of each sail fast by the jigger,
      with a man on each yard, at the word the whole canvas of the ship was loosed, and with the
      greatest rapidity possible everything was sheeted home and hoisted up, the anchor tripped and
      cat-headed, and the ship under headway.</q>
    </p>
    <p>Again: <q>The royal yards were all crossed at once, and royals and sky-sails set, and, as we
      had the wind free, the booms were run out, and all were aloft, active as cats, laying out on
      the yards and booms, reeving the studdingsail gear; and sail after sail the captain piled upon
      her, until she was covered with canvas, her sails looking like a great white cloud resting
      upon a black speck.</q>
    </p>
    <p>Once more. A race in the Pacific: <q>Our antagonist was in her best trim. Being clear of the
      point, the breeze became stiff, and the royal-masts bent under our <pb n="71"/> sails, but we
      would not take them in until we saw three boys spring into the rigging of the <hi
       rend="italic">California;</hi> then they were all furled at once, but with orders to our boys
      to stay aloft at the top-gallant mast-heads and loose them again at the word. It was my duty
      to furl the fore-royal; and while standing by to loose it again, I had a fine view of the
      scene. From where I stood, the two vessels seemed nothing but spars and sails, while their
      narrow decks, far below, slanting over by the force of the wind aloft, appeared hardly capable
      of supporting the great fabrics raised upon them. The <hi rend="italic">California</hi> was to
      windward of us, and had every advantage; yet, while the breeze was stiff we held our own. As
      soon as it began to slacken she ranged a little ahead, and the order was given to loose the
      royals. In an instant the gaskets were off and the bunt dropped. "Sheet home the
      fore-royal!"&mdash;"Weather sheet's home!"&mdash;"Lee sheet's home!"&mdash;"Hoist away, sir!"
      is bawled from aloft." "Overhaul your clewlines!" shouts the mate."Aye-aye, sir, all
      clear!"&mdash;"Taut leech! <pb n="72"/> belay! Well the lee brace; haul taut to windward!"and
      the royals are set.</q>
    </p>
    <p>What would the captain of any sailing-vessel of our time say to that? He would say,"The man
     that wrote that didn't learn his trade out of a book, he has <hi rend="italic">been</hi>
     there!" But would this same captain be competent to sit in judgment upon Shakespeare's
     seamanship&mdash;considering the changes in ships and ship-talk that have necessarily taken
     place, unrecorded, unremembered, and lost to history in the last three hundred years? It is my
     conviction that Shakespeare's sailor-talk would be Choctaw to him. For instance&mdash;from <hi
      rend="italic">The Tempest:</hi></p>

       off.</p>
     </sp></q>

    <p>That will do, for the present; let us yare a little, now, for a change. </p>
    <p>If a man should write a book and in it make one of his characters say, "Here, devil, empty
     the quoins into the standing galley and the imposing stone into the hell-box; assemble the
     comps around the frisket and let them jeff for takes and be quick about it," I should recognize
     a mistake or two in the phrasing, and would know that the writer was only a printer
     theoretically, not practically. </p>
    <p>I have been a quartz miner in the silver regions&mdash;a pretty hard life; I know all <pb
      n="74"/> the palaver of that business: I know all about discovery claims and the subordinate
     claims; I know all about lodes, ledges, outcroppings, dips, spurs, angles, shafts, drifts,
     inclines, levels, tunnels, air-shafts, "horses," clay casings, granite casings; quartz mills
     and their batteries; arastras, and how to charge them with quicksilver and sulphate of copper;
     and how to clean them up, and how to reduce the resulting amalgam in the retorts, and how to
     cast the bullion into pigs; and finally I know how to screen tailings, and also how to hunt for
     something less robust to do, and find it. I know the <hi rend="italic">argot</hi> of the
     quartz-mining and milling industry familiarly; and so whenever Bret Harte introduces that
     industry into a story, the first time one of his miners opens his mouth I recognize from his
     phrasing that Harte got the phrasing by listening&mdash;like Shakespeare&mdash;I mean <pb
      n="75"/> the Stratford one&mdash;not by experience. No one can talk the quartz dialect
     correctly without learning it with pick and shovel and drill and fuse. </p>
    <p>I have been a surface-miner&mdash;gold&mdash;and I know all its mysteries, and the dialect
     that belongs with them; and whenever Harte introduces that industry into a story I know by the
     phrasing of his characters that neither he nor they have ever served that trade. </p>
    <p>I have been a "pocket" miner&mdash;a sort of gold mining not findable in any but one little
     spot in the world, so far as I know. I know how, with horn and water, to find the trail of a
     pocket and trace it step by step and stage by stage up the mountain to its source, and find the
     compact little nest of yellow metal reposing in its secret home under the ground. I know the
     language of that trade, that capricious trade, that fascinating <pb n="76"/> buried-treasure
     trade, and can catch any writer who tries to use it without having learned it by the sweat of
     his brow and the labor of his hands. </p>
    <p>I know several other trades and the <hi rend="italic">argot</hi> that goes with them; and
     whenever a person tries to talk the talk peculiar to any of them without having learned it at
     its source I can trap him always before he gets far on his road. </p>
    <p>And so, as I have already remarked, if I were required to superintend a Bacon-Shakespeare
     controversy, I would narrow the matter down to a single question&mdash;the only one, so far as
     the previous controversies have informed me, concerning which illustrious experts of
     unimpeachable competency have testified: <hi rend="italic">Was the author of Shakespeare's
      Works a lawyer?</hi>&mdash;a lawyer deeply read and of limitless experience? I would put aside
     the <pb n="77"/> guesses, and surmises, and perhapses, and might-have-beens, and <orig
      reg="could-have-beens"> could-have beens</orig>, and must-have-beens, and <orig
      reg="we-are-justified-in-presumings">we-are justified-in-presumings</orig>, and the rest of
     those vague specters and shadows and indefinitenesses, and stand or fall, win or lose, by the
     verdict rendered by the jury upon that single question. If the verdict was Yes, I should feel
     quite convinced that the Stratford Shakespeare, the actor, manager, and trader who died so
     obscure, so forgotten, so destitute of even village consequence that sixty years afterward no
     fellow-citizen and friend of his later days remembered to tell anything about him, did not
     write the Works. </p>

    <head>VIII<lb/> Shakespeare as a Lawyer<ref target="n8.1">[1]</ref><lb/>
    </head>

    <div2 type="section" id="d20">
     <p>THE Plays and Poems of Shakespeare supply ample evidence that their author not only had a
      very extensive and accurate knowledge of law, but that he was well acquainted with the manners
      and customs of members of the Inns of Court and with legal life generally. </p>
     <p>"While novelists and dramatists are constantly making mistakes as to the laws of marriage,
      of wills, and inheritance, to Shakespeare's law, lavishly as he expounds it, there can neither
      be demurrer, nor bill of exceptions, nor writ of error." Such was the testimony borne by one
      of the most distinguished lawyers of the nineteenth century <pb n="80"/> who was raised to the
      high office of Lord Chief Justice in 1850, and subsequently became Lord Chancellor. Its weight
      will, doubtless, be more appreciated by lawyers than by laymen, for only lawyers know how
      impossible it is for those who have not served an apprenticeship to the law to avoid
      displaying their ignorance if they venture to employ legal terms and to discuss legal
      doctrines. "There is nothing so dangerous," wrote Lord Campbell, "as for one not of the craft
      to tamper with our freemasonry." A layman is certain to betray himself by using some
      expression which a lawyer would never employ. Mr. Sidney Lee himself supplies us with an
      example of this. He writes (p. 164): "On February 15, 1609, Shakespeare . . . obtained
      judgment from a jury against Addenbroke for the payment of No. 6, and No. 1. 5<hi
       rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. costs." Now a lawyer would never have spoken
      of obtaining "judgment from a jury," for it is the function of a jury not to deliver judgment
      (which is the prerogative of the court), but to find a verdict on the facts. The error is,
      indeed, a venial <pb n="81"/> one, but it is just one of those little things which at once
      enable a lawyer to know if the writer is a layman or "one of the craft." </p>
     <p>But when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal subjects, he is naturally apt to make
      an exhibition of his incompetence. "Let a non-professional man, however acute," writes Lord
      Campbell again, "presume to talk law, or to draw illustrations from legal science in
      discussing other subjects, and he will speedily fall into laughable absurdity." </p>
     <p>And what does the same high authority say about Shakespeare? He had "a deep technical
      knowledge of the law," and an easy familiarity with "some of the most abstruse proceedings in
      English jurisprudence." And again: "Whenever he indulges this propensity he uniformly lays
      down good law." Of <hi rend="italic">Henry IV.</hi>, Part 2, he says: "If Lord Eldon could be
      supposed to have written the play, I do not see how he could be chargeable with having
      forgotten any of his law while writing it." Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke speak of "the
      marvelous intimacy which he displays with legal terms, his frequent adoption <pb n="82"/> of
      them in illustration, and his curiously technical knowledge of their form and force." Malone,
      himself a lawyer, wrote: "His knowledge of legal terms is not merely such as might be acquired
      by the casual observation of even his all-comprehending mind; it has the appearance of
      technical skill." Another lawyer and well-known Shakespearean, Richard Grant White, says: "No
      dramatist of the time, not even Beaumont, who was the younger son of a judge of the Common
      Pleas, and who after studying in the Inns of Court abandoned law for the drama, used legal
      phrases with Shakespeare's readiness and exactness. And the significance of this fact is
      heightened by another, that it is only to the language of the law that he exhibits this
      inclination. The phrases peculiar to other occupations serve him on rare occasions by way of
      description, comparison or illustration, generally when something in the scene suggests them,
      but legal phrases flow from his pen as part of his vocabulary, and parcel of his thought. Take
      the word 'purchase' for instance, which, in ordinary <pb n="83"/> use, means to acquire by
      giving value, but applies in law to all legal modes of obtaining property except by
      inheritance or descent, and in this peculiar sense the word occurs five times in Shakespeare's
      thirty-four plays, and only in one single instance in the fifty-four plays of Beaumont and
      Fletcher. It has been suggested that it was in attendance upon the courts in London that he
      picked up his legal vocabulary. But this supposition not only fails to account for
      Shakespeare's peculiar freedom and exactness in the use of that phraseology, it does not even
      place him in the way of learning those terms his use of which is most remarkable, which are
      not such as he would have heard at ordinary proceedings at <hi rend="italic">nisi prius,</hi>
      but such as refer to the tenure or transfer of real property, 'fine and recovery,' 'statutes
      merchant,' 'purchase,' 'indenture,' 'tenure,' 'double voucher,' 'fee simple,' 'fee farm,'
      'remainder,' 'reversion,' 'forfeiture,' etc. This conveyancer's jargon could not have been
      picked up by hanging round the courts of law in London two hundred and fifty <pb n="84"/>
      years ago, when suits as to the title of real property were comparatively rare. And beside,
      Shakespeare uses his law just as freely in his first plays, written in his first London years,
      as in those produced at a later period. Just as exactly, too; for the correctness and
      propriety with which these terms are introduced have compelled the admiration of a Chief
      Justice and a Lord Chancellor." </p>
     <p>Senator Davis wrote: "We seem to have something more than a sciolist's temerity of
      indulgence in the terms of an unfamiliar art. No legal solecisms will be found. The abstrusest
      elements of the common law are impressed into a disciplined service. Over and over again,
      where such knowledge is unexampled in writers unlearned in the law, Shakespeare appears in
      perfect possession of it. In the law of real property, its rules of tenure and descents, its
      entails, its fines and recoveries, their vouchers and double vouchers, in the procedure of the
      Courts, the method of bringing writs and arrests, the nature of actions, the rules of
      pleading, the <pb n="85"/> law of escapes and of contempt of court, in the principles of
      evidence, both technical and philosophical, in the distinction between the temporal and
      spiritual tribunals, in the law of attainder and forfeiture, in the requisites of a valid
      marriage, in the presumption of legitimacy, in the learning of the law of prerogative, in the
      inalienable character of the Crown, this mastership appears with surprising authority." </p>
     <p>To all this testimony (and there is much more which I have not cited) may now be added that
      of a great lawyer of our own times, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>: Sir James Plaisted Wilde,
      Q.C. 1855, created a Baron of the Exchequer in 1860, promoted to the post of Judge-Ordinary
      and Judge of the Courts of Probate and Divorce in 1863, and better known to the world as Lord
      Penzance, to which dignity he was raised in 1869. Lord Penzance, as all lawyers know, and as
      the late Mr. Inderwick, K.C., has testified, was one of the first legal authorities of his
      day, famous for his "remarkable grasp of legal principles, and "endowed by nature with a
      remarkable <pb n="86"/> facility for marshalling facts, and for a clear expression of his
      views." </p>
     <p>Lord Penzance speaks of Shakespeare's "perfect familiarity with not only the principles,
      axioms, and maxims, but the technicalities of English law, a knowledge so perfect and intimate
      that he was never incorrect and never at fault. . .The mode in which this knowledge was
      pressed into service on all occasions to express his meaning and illustrate his thoughts, was
      quite unexampled. He seems to have had a special pleasure in his complete and ready mastership
      of it in all its branches. As manifested in the plays, this legal knowledge and learning had
      therefore a special character which places it on a wholly different footing from the rest of
      the multifarious knowledge which is exhibited in page after page of the plays. At every turn
      and point at which the author required a metaphor, simile, or illustration, his mind ever
      turned <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to the law. He seems almost to have <hi rend="italic"
       >thought</hi> in legal phrases, the commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of
      his pen in description or <pb n="87"/> illustration. That he should have descanted in lawyer
      language when he had a forensic subject in hand, such as Shylock's bond, was to be expected,
      but the knowledge of law in 'Shakespeare' was exhibited in a far different manner: it
      protruded itself on all occasions, appropriate or inappropriate, and mingled itself with
      strains of thought widely divergent from forensic subjects." Again: "To acquire a perfect
      familiarity with legal principles, and an accurate and ready use of the technical terms and
      phrases not only of the conveyancer's office but of the pleader's chambers and the Courts at
      Westminster, nothing short of employment in some career involving constant contact with legal
      questions and general legal work would be requisite. But a continuous employment involves the
      element of time, and time was just what the manager of two theaters had not at his disposal.
      In what portion of Shakespeare's (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> Shakspere's) career would it be
      possible to point out that time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment in
      the chambers or offices of practicing lawyers?" <pb n="88"/>
     </p>
     <p>Stratfordians, as is well known, casting about for some possible explanation of
      Shakespeare's extraordinary knowledge of law, have made the suggestion that Shakespeare might,
      conceivably, have been a clerk in an attorney's office before he came to London. Mr. Collier
      wrote to Lord Campbell to ask his opinion as to the probability of this being true. His answer
      was as follows: "You require us to believe implicitly a fact, of which, if true, positive and
      irrefragable evidence in his own handwriting might have been forthcoming to establish it. Not
      having been actually enrolled as an attorney, neither the records of the local court at
      Stratford nor of the superior Courts at Westminster would present his name as being concerned
      in any suit as an attorney, but it might reasonably have been expected that there would be
      deeds or wills witnessed by him still extant, and after a very diligent search none such can
      be discovered." </p>
     <p>Upon this Lord Penzance comments: "It cannot be doubted that Lord Campbell was right in
      this. No young man could have <pb n="89"/> been at work in an attorney's office without being
      called upon continually to act as a witness, and in many other ways leaving traces of his work
      and name." There is not a single fact or incident in all that is known of Shakespeare, even by
      rumor or tradition, which supports this notion of a clerkship. And after much argument and
      surmise which has been indulged in on this subject, we may, I think, safely put the notion on
      one side, for no less an authority than Mr. Grant White says finally that the idea of his
      having been clerk to an attorney has been "blown to pieces." </p>
     <p>It is altogether characteristic of Mr. Churton Collins that he, nevertheless, adopts this
      exploded myth. "That Shakespeare was in early life employed as a clerk in an attorney's
      office, may be correct. At Stratford there was by royal charter a Court of Record sitting
      every fortnight, with six attorneys, beside the town clerk, belonging to it, and it is
      certainly not straining probability to suppose that the young Shakespeare may have had
      employment in one of <pb n="90"/> them. There is, it is true, no tradition to this effect, but
      such traditions as we have about Shakespeare's occupation between the time of leaving school
      and going to London are so loose and baseless that no confidence can be placed in them. It is,
      to say the least, more probable that he was in an attorney's office than that he was a butcher
      killing calves 'in a high style,' and making speeches over them." </p>
     <p>This is a charming specimen of Stratfordian argument. There is, as we have seen, a very old
      tradition that Shakespeare was a butcher's apprentice. John Dowdall, who made a tour in
      Warwickshire in 1693, testifies to it as coming from the old clerk who showed him over the
      church, and it is unhesitatingly accepted as true by Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps. (Vol. I, p. II,
      and see Vol. II, p. 71, 72.) Mr. Sidney Lee sees nothing improbable in it, and it is supported
      by Aubrey, who must have written his account some time before 1680, when his manuscript was
      completed. Of the attorney's clerk hypothesis, on the other hand, there is not the faintest
      vestige <pb n="91"/> of a tradition. It has been evolved out of the fertile imaginations of
      embarrassed Stratfordians, seeking for some explanation of the Stratford rustic's marvelous
      acquaintance with law and legal terms and legal life. But Mr. Churton Collins has not the
      least hesitation in throwing over the tradition which has the warrant of antiquity and setting
      up in its stead this ridiculous invention, for which not only is there no shred of positive
      evidence, but which, as Lord Campbell and Lord Penzance point out, is really put out of court
      by the negative evidence, since "no young man could have been at work in an attorney's office
      without being called upon continually to act as a witness, and in many other ways leaving
      traces of his work and name." And as Mr. Edwards further points out, since the day when Lord
      Campbell's book was published (between forty and fifty years ago), "every old deed or will, to
      say nothing of other legal papers, dated during the period of William Shakespeare's youth, has
      been scrutinized over half a dozen shires, and not one signature of the young man has been
      found." <pb n="92"/>
     </p>
     <p>Moreover, if Shakespeare had served as clerk in an attorney's office it is clear that he
      must have so served for a considerable period in order to have gained (if indeed it is
      credible that he could have so gained) his remarkable knowledge of law. Can we then for a
      moment believe that, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent on the
      matter? That Dowdall's old clerk, over eighty years of age, should have never heard of it
      (though he was sure enough about the butcher's apprentice), and that all the other ancient
      witnesses should be in similar ignorance! </p>
     <p>But such are the methods of Stratfordian controversy. Tradition is to be scouted when it is
      found inconvenient, but cited as irrefragable truth when it suits the case. Shakespeare of
      Stratford was the author of the <hi rend="italic">Plays</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>,
      but the author of the <hi rend="italic">Plays</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> could not
      have been a butcher's apprentice. Away, therefore, with tradition. But the author of the <hi
       rend="italic">Plays</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Poems must</hi> have had a very large and a
      very accurate knowledge of the law. Therefore, <pb n="93"/> Shakespeare of Stratford must have
      been an attorney's clerk! The method is simplicity itself. By similar reasoning Shakespeare
      has been made a country schoolmaster, a soldier, a physician, a printer, and a good many other
      things beside, according to the inclination and the exigencies of the commentator. It would
      not be in the least surprising to find that he was studying Latin as a schoolmaster and law in
      an attorney's office at the same time. </p>
     <p>However, we must do Mr. Collins the justice of saying that he has fully recognized, what is
      indeed tolerably obvious, that Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training. "It may, of
      course, be urged," he writes, "that Shakespeare's knowledge of medicine, and particularly that
      branch of it which related to morbid psychology, is equally remarkable, and that no one has
      ever contended that he was a physician. (Here Mr. Collins is wrong; that contention also has
      been put forward.) It may be urged that his acquaintance with the technicalities of other
      crafts and callings, notably of marine and <pb n="94"/> military affairs, was also
      extraordinary, and yet no one has suspected him of being a sailor or a soldier. (Wrong again.
      Why even Messrs. Garnett and Gosse 'suspect' that he was a soldier!) This may be conceded, but
      the concession hardly furnishes an analogy. To these and all other subjects he recurs
      occasionally, and in season, but with reminiscences of the law his memory, as is abundantly
      clear, was simply saturated. In season and out of season now in manifest, now in recondite
      application, he presses it into the service of expression and illustration. At least a third
      of his myriad metaphors are derived from it. It would indeed be difficult to find a single act
      in any of his dramas, nay, in some of them, a single scene, the diction and imagery of which
      is not colored by it. Much of his law may have been acquired from three books easily
      accessible to him, namely Tottell's <hi rend="italic">Precedents</hi> (1572), Pulton's <hi
       rend="italic">Statutes</hi> (1578), and Fraunce's <hi rend="italic">Lawier's Logike</hi>
      (1588), works with which he certainly seems to have been familiar; but much of it could only
      have <pb n="95"/> come from one who had an intimate acquaintance with legal proceedings. We
      quite agree with Mr. Castle that Shakespeare's legal knowledge is not what could have been
      picked up in an attorney's office, but could only have been learned by an actual attendance at
      the Courts, at a Pleader's Chambers, and on circuit, or by associating intimately with members
      of the Bench and Bar." </p>
     <p>This is excellent. But what is Mr. Collins' explanation. "Perhaps the simplest solution of
      the problem is to accept the hypothesis that in early life he was in an attorney's office (!),
      that he there contracted a love for the law which never left him, that as a young man in
      London, he continued to study or dabble in it for his amusement, to stroll in leisure hours
      into the Courts, and to frequent the society of lawyers. On no other supposition is it
      possible to explain the attraction which the law evidently had for him, and his minute and
      undeviating accuracy in a subject where no layman who has indulged in such copious and
      ostentatious display of <pb n="96"/> legal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in keeping
      himself from tripping." </p>
     <p>A lame conclusion. "No other supposition" indeed! Yes, there is another, and a very obvious
      supposition, namely, that Shakespeare was himself a lawyer, well versed in his trade, versed
      in all the ways of the courts, and living in close intimacy with judges and members of the
      Inns of Court. </p>
     <p>One is, of course, thankful that Mr. Collins has appreciated the fact that Shakespeare must
      have had a sound legal training, but I may be forgiven if I do not attach quite so much
      importance to his pronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those of Malone, Lord
      Campbell, Judge Holmes, Mr. Castle, K.C., Lord Penzance, Mr. Grant White, and other lawyers,
      who have expressed their opinion on the matter of Shakespeare's legal acquirements. . . . </p>
     <p>Here it may, perhaps, be worth while to quote again from Lord Penzance's book as to the
      suggestion that Shakespeare had somehow or other managed "to acquire a perfect familiarity
      with legal principles, and an <pb n="97"/> accurate and ready use of the technical terms and
      phrases, not only of the conveyancer's voice, but of the pleader's chambers and the courts at
      Westminster." This, as Lord Penzance points out, "would require nothing short of employment in
      some career involving <hi rend="italic">constant contact</hi> with legal questions and general
      legal work." But "in what portion of Shakespeare's career would it be possible to point out
      that time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment in the chambers or
      offices of practicing lawyers?. . .It is beyond doubt that at an early period he was called
      upon to abandon his attendance at school and assist his father, and was soon after, at the age
      of sixteen, bound apprentice to a trade. While under the obligation of this bond he could not
      have pursued any other employment. Then he leaves Stratford and comes to London. He has to
      provide himself with the means of a livelihood, and this he did in some capacity at the
      theater. No one doubts that. The holding of horses is scouted by many, and perhaps with
      justice, as <pb n="98"/> being unlikely and certainly unproved; but whatever the nature of his
      employment was at the theater, there is hardly room for the belief that it could have been
      other than continuous, for his progress there was so rapid. Ere long he had been taken into
      the company as an actor, and was soon spoken of as a 'Johannes Factotum.' His rapid
      accumulation of wealth speaks volumes for the constancy and activity of his services. One
      fails to see when there could be a break in the current of his life at this period of it,
      giving room or opportunity for legal or indeed any other employment. 'In 1589,' says Knight,
      'we have undeniable evidence that he had not only a casual engagement, was not only a salaried
      servant, as many players were, but was a shareholder in the company of the Queen's players
      with other shareholders below him on the list.' This (1589) would be within two years after
      his arrival in London, which is placed by White and Halliwell-Phillipps about the year 1587.
      The difficulty in supposing that, starting with a state of ignorance in 1587, when he is <pb
       n="99"/> supposed to have come to London, he was induced to enter upon a course of most
      extended study and mental culture, is almost insuperable. Still it was physically possible,
      provided always that he could have had access to the needful books. But this legal training
      seems to me to stand on a different footing. It is not only unaccountable and incredible, but
      it is actually negatived by the known facts of his career.' Lord Penzance then refers to the
      fact that "by 1592 (according to the best authority, Mr. Grant White) several of the plays had
      been written. <hi rend="italic">The Comedy of Errors</hi> in 1589, <hi rend="italic">Love's
       Labou's Lost</hi> in 1589, <hi rend="italic">Two Gentlemen of Verona</hi> in 1589 or 1590,
      and so forth, and then asks, "with this catalogue of dramatic work on hand. . .was it possible
      that he could have taken a leading part in the management and conduct of two theaters, and if
      Mr. Phillipps is to be relied upon, taken his share in the performances of the provincial
      tours of his company&mdash;and at the same time devoted himself to the study of the law in all
      its branches so efficiently as to make himself complete <pb n="100"/> master of its principles
      and practice, and saturate his mind with all its most technical terms?" </p>
     <p>I have cited this passage from Lord Penzance's book, because it lay before me, and I had
      already quoted from it on the matter of Shakespeare's legal knowledge; but other writers have
      still better set forth the insuperable difficulties, as they seem to me, which beset the idea
      that Shakespeare might have found time in some unknown period of early life, amid multifarious
      other occupations, for the study of classics, literature and law, to say nothing of languages
      and a few other matters. Lord Penzance further asks his readers: "Did you ever meet with or
      hear of an instance in which a young man in this country gave himself up to legal studies and
      engaged in legal employments, which is the only way of becoming familiar with the
      technicalities of practice, unless with the view of practicing in that profession? I do not
      believe that it would be easy, or indeed possible, to produce an instance in which the law has
      been seriously studied in all its <pb n="101"/> branches, except as a qualification for
      practice in the legal profession."</p>

      n="103"/> them harsh names; the most I can do is to indicate them by terms reflecting my
     disapproval; and this without malice, without venom. </p>
    <p>To resume. What I was about to say, was, those thugs have built their entire superstition
     upon <hi rend="italic">inferences,</hi> not upon known and established facts. It is a weak
     method, and poor, and I am glad to be able to say our side never resorts to it while there is
     anything else to resort to. </p>
    <p>But when we must, we must; and we have now arrived at a place of that sort. . . .Since the
     Stratford Shakespeare couldn't have written the Works, we infer that somebody did. Who was it,
     then? This requires some more inferring. </p>
    <p>Ordinarily when an unsigned poem sweeps across the continent like a tidal wave, whose roar
     and boom and thunder <pb n="104"/> are made up of admiration, delight and applause, a dozen
     obscure people rise up and claim the authorship. Why a dozen, instead of only one or two? One
     reason is, because there's a dozen that are recognizably competent to do that poem. Do you
     remember "Beautiful Snow"? Do you remember "Rock Me to Sleep, Mother, Rock Me to Sleep"? Do you
     remember "Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy flight! Make me a child again just for
     to-night"? I remember them very well. Their authorship was claimed by most of the grown-up
     people who were alive at the time, and every claimant had one plausible argument in his favor,
     at least: to wit, he could have done the authoring; he was competent. </p>
    <p>Have the Works been claimed by a dozen? They haven't. There was good reason. The world knows
     there was but <pb n="105"/> one man on the planet at the time who was competent&mdash;not a
     dozen, and not two. A long time ago the dwellers in a far country used now and then to find a
     procession of prodigious footprints stretching across the plain&mdash;footprints that were
     three miles apart, each footprint a third of a mile long and a furlong deep, and with forests
     and villages mashed to mush in it. Was there any doubt as to who had made that mighty trail?
     Were there a dozen claimants? Were there two? No&mdash;the people knew who it was that had been
     along there: there was only one Hercules. </p>
    <p>There has been only one Shakespeare. There couldn't be two; certainly there couldn't be two
     at the same time. It takes ages to bring forth a Shakespeare, and some more ages to match him.
     This one was not matched before his time; nor during his time; and hasn't been <pb n="106"/>
     matched since. The prospect of matching him in our time is not bright. </p>
    <p>The Baconians claim that the Stratford Shakespeare was not qualified to write the Works, and
     that Francis Bacon was. They claim that Bacon possessed the stupendous equipment&mdash;both
     natural and acquired&mdash;for the miracle; and that no other Englishman of his day possessed
     the like; or, indeed, anything closely approaching it. </p>
    <p>Macaulay, in his Essay, has much to say about the splendor and horizonless magnitude of that
     equipment. Also, he has synopsized Bacon's history: a thing which cannot be done for the
     Stratford Shakespeare, for he hasn't any history to synopsize. Bacon's history is open to the
     world, from his boyhood to his death in old age&mdash;a history consisting of known facts,
     displayed in minute and multitudinous detail; <hi rend="italic">facts,</hi> not <pb n="107"/>
     guesses and conjectures and might-have-beens. </p>
    <p>Whereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen, and had a Lord Chancellor for his
     father, and a mother who was "distinguished both as a linguist and a theologian: she
     corresponded in Greek with Bishop Jewell, and translated his <hi rend="italic">Apologia</hi>
     from the Latin so correctly that neither he nor Archbishop Parker could suggest a single
     alteration." It is the atmosphere we are reared in that determines how our inclinations and
     aspirations shall tend. The atmosphere furnished by the parents to the son in this present case
     was an atmosphere saturated with learning; with thinkings and ponderings upon deep subjects;
     and with polite culture. It had its natural effect. Shakespeare of Stratford was reared in a
     house which had no use for books, since its owners, his parents, <pb n="108"/> were without
     education. This may have had an effect upon the son, but we do not know, because we have no
     history of him of an informing sort. There were but few books anywhere, in that day, and only
     the well-to-do and highly educated possessed them, they being almost confined to the dead
     languages. "All the valuable books then extant in all the vernacular dialects of Europe would
     hardly have filled a single shelf"&mdash;imagine it! The few existing books were in the Latin
     tongue mainly. "A person who was ignorant of it was shut out from all acquaintance&mdash;not
     merely with Cicero and Virgil, but with the most interesting memoirs, state papers, and
     pamphlets of his own time"&mdash;a literature necessary to the Stratford lad, for his
     fictitious reputation's sake, since the writer of his Works would begin to use it wholesale and
     in a most masterly way before <pb n="109"/> the lad was hardly more than out of his teens and
     into his twenties. </p>
    <p>At fifteen Bacon was sent to the university, and he spent three years there. Thence he went
     to Paris in the train of the English Ambassador, and there he mingled daily with the wise, the
     cultured, the great, and the aristocracy of fashion, during another three years. A total of six
     years spent at the sources of knowledge; knowledge both of books and of men. The three spent at
     the university were coeval with the second and last three spent by the little Stratford lad at
     Stratford school supposedly, and perhapsedly, and maybe, and by inference&mdash;with nothing to
     infer from. The second three of the Baconian six were "presumably" spent by the Stratford lad
     as apprentice to a butcher. That is, the thugs presume it&mdash;on no evidence of any kind.
     Which is their way, when they <pb n="110"/> want a historical fact. Fact and presumption are,
     for business purposes, all the same to them. They know the difference, but they also know how
     to blink it. They know, too, that while in history-building a fact is better than a
     presumption, it doesn't take a presumption long to bloom into a fact when <hi rend="italic"
      >they</hi> have the handling of it. They know by old experience that when they get hold of a
     presumption-tadpole he is not going to <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> tadpole in their
     history-tank; no, they know how to develop him into the giant four-legged bullfrog of <hi
      rend="italic">fact,</hi> and make him sit up on his hams, and puff out his chin, and look
     important and insolent and come-to-stay; and assert his genuine simon-pure authenticity with a
     thundering bellow that will convince everybody because it is so loud. The thug is aware that
     loudness convinces sixty persons where reasoning convinces <pb n="111"/> but one. I wouldn't be
     a thug, not even if&mdash;but never mind about that, it has nothing to do with the argument,
     and it is not noble in spirit besides. If I am better than a thug, is the merit mine? No, it is
     His. Then to Him be the praise. That is the right spirit. </p>
    <p>They "presume" the lad severed his "presumed" connection with the Stratford school to become
     apprentice to a butcher. They also "presume" that the butcher was his father. They don't know.
     There is no written record of it, nor any other actual evidence. If it would have helped their
     case any, they would have apprenticed him to thirty butchers, to fifty butchers, to a
     wilderness of butchers&mdash;all by their patented method "presumption." If it will help their
     case they will do it yet; and if it will further help it, they will "presume" that all those
     butchers were his father. And <pb n="112"/> the week after, they will <hi rend="italic"
      >say</hi> it. Why, it is just like being the past tense of the compound reflexive adverbial
     incandescent hypodermic irregular accusative Noun of Multitude; which is father to the
     expression which the grammarians call Verb. It is like a whole ancestry, with only one
     posterity. </p>
    <p>To resume. Next, the young Bacon took up the study of law, and mastered that abstruse
     science. From that day to the end of his life he was daily in close contact with lawyers and
     judges; not as a casual onlooker in intervals between holding horses in front of a theater, but
     as a practicing lawyer&mdash;a great and successful one, a renowned one, a Launcelot of the
     bar, the most formidable lance in the high brotherhood of the legal Table Round; he lived in
     the law's atmosphere thenceforth, all his years, and by sheer ability forced his way up its
     difficult <pb n="113"/> steeps to its supremest summit, the Lord Chancellorship, leaving behind
     him no fellow craftsman qualified to challenge his divine right to that majestic place. </p>
    <p>When we read the praises bestowed by Lord Penzance and the other illustrious experts upon the
     legal condition and legal aptnesses, brilliances, profundities and felicities so prodigally
     displayed in the Plays, and try to fit them to the historyless Stratford stage-manager, they
     sound wild, strange, incredible, ludicrous; but when we put them in the mouth of Bacon they do
     not sound strange, they seem in their natural and rightful place, they seem at home there.
     Please turn back and read them again. Attributed to Shakespeare of Stratford they are
     meaningless, they are inebriate extravagancies&mdash;intemperate admirations of the dark side
     of the moon, so to speak; attributed <pb n="114"/> to Bacon, they are admirations of the golden
     glories of the moon's front side, the moon at the full&mdash;and not intemperate, not
     overwrought, but sane and right, and justified. "At every turn and point at which the author
     required a metaphor, simile or illustration, his mind ever turned <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
     to the law; he seems almost to have <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> in legal phrases; the
     commonest legal phrases, the commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of his pen."
     That could happen to no one but a person whose <hi rend="italic">trade</hi> was the law; it
     could not happen to a dabbler in it. Veteran mariners fill their conversation with
     sailor-phrases and draw all their similes from the ship and the sea and the storm, but no mere
      <hi rend="italic">passenger</hi> ever does it, be he of Stratford or elsewhere; or could do it
     with anything resembling accuracy, if he were hardy enough to try. Please read again <pb
      n="115"/> what Lord Campbell and the other great authorities have said about Bacon when they
     thought they were saying it about Shakespeare of Stratford.</p>

    <head>X<lb/> The Rest of the Equipment<lb/>
    </head>

    <p>THE author of the Plays was equipped, beyond every other man of his time, with wisdom,
     erudition, imagination, capaciousness of mind, grace and majesty of expression. Every one has
     said it, no one doubts it. Also, he had humor, humor in rich abundance, and always wanting to
     break out. We have no evidence of any kind that Shakespeare of Stratford possessed any of these
     gifts or any of these acquirements. The only lines he ever wrote, so far as we know, are
     substantially barren of the&mdash; barren of all of them.</p>

    <lg type="verse">
     <l>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare </l>
     <l>To digg the dust encloased heare: </l>

    </lg>

    <pb n="117"/>
    <p>Ben Jonson says of Bacon, as orator: <q>His language, <hi rend="italic">where he could spare
       and pass by a jest,</hi> was nobly censorious. No man ever spoke more neatly, more pressly,
      more weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. No member of
      his speech but consisted of his (its) own graces. . . The fear of every man that heard him was
      lest he should make an end.</q>
    </p>
    <p>From Macaulay: <q>He continued to distinguish himself in Parliament, particularly by his
      exertions in favor of one excellent measure on which the King's heart was set&mdash;the union
      of England and Scotland. It was not difficult for such an intellect to discover many
      irresistible arguments in favor of such a scheme. He conducted the great case of the <hi
       rend="italic">Post Nati</hi> in the Exchequer Chamber; and the decision of the judges&mdash;a
      decision the legality of which may be questioned, but the beneficial effect of which must be
      acknowledged&mdash;was in a great measure attributed to his dexterous management.</q>
     <pb n="118"/>
    </p>
    <p>Again:</p>

    <p><q>While actively engaged in the House of Commons and in the courts of law, he still found
      leisure for letters and philosophy. The noble treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Advancement of
       Learning,</hi> which at a later period was expanded into the <hi rend="italic">De
       Augmentis,</hi> appeared in 1605.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q> The <hi rend="italic">Wisdom of the Ancients,</hi> a work which if it had proceeded from
      any other writer would have been considered as a masterpiece of wit and learning, was printed
      in 1609.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q> In the meantime the <hi rend="italic">Novum Organum</hi> was slowly proceeding. Several
      distinguished men of learning had been permitted to see portions of that extraordinary book,
      and they spoke with the greatest admiration of his genius.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q> Even Sir Thomas Bodley, after perusing the <hi rend="italic">Cogitata et Visa,</hi> one
      of the most precious of those scattered leaves out of which the great oracular volume was
      afterward made up, acknowledged that "in all proposals and <pb n="119"/> plots in that book,
      Bacon showed himself a master workman"; and that "it could not be gainsaid but all the
      treatise over did abound with choice conceits of the present state of learning, and with
      worthy contemplations of the means to procure it."</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>In 1612 a new edition of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> appeared, with additions
      surpassing the original collection both in bulk and quality.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>Nor did these pursuits distract Bacon's attention from a work the most arduous, the most
      glorious, and the most useful that even his mighty powers could have achieved, "the reducing
      and recompiling," to use his own phrase, "of the laws of England."</q>
    </p>
    <p>To serve the exacting and laborious offices of Attorney General and Solicitor General would
     have satisfied the appetite of any other man for hard work, but Bacon had to add the vast
     literary industries just described, to satisfy his. He was a born worker. <pb n="120"/>
    </p>
    <p><q>The service which he rendered to letters during the last five years of his life, amid ten
      thousand distractions and vexations, increase the regret with which we think on the many years
      which he had wasted, to use the words of Sir Thomas Bodley, "on such study as was not worthy
      such a student."</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>He commenced a digest of the laws of England, a History of England under the Princes of
      the House of Tudor, a body of National History, a Philosophical Romance. He made extensive and
      valuable additions to his Essays. He published the inestimable treatise <hi rend="italic">De
       Augmentis Scientiarum.</hi></q>
    </p>
    <p>Did these labors of Hercules fill up his time to his contentment, and quiet his appetite for
     work? Not entirely: <q>The trifles with which he amused himself in hours of pain and languor
      bore the mark of his mind. <hi rend="italic">The best jestbook in the world</hi> is that which
      he dictated from memory, without referring to any book, on a day on which illness had rendered
      him incapable of serious study.</q>
     <pb n="121"/>
    </p>
    <p>Here are some scattered remarks (from Macaulay) which throw light upon Bacon, and seem to
     indicate&mdash;and maybe demonstrate&mdash;that he was competent to write the Plays and Poems: </p>
    <p><q>With great minuteness of observation he had an amplitude of comprehension such as has
      never yet been vouchsafed to any other human being.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>The "Essays" contain abundant proofs that no nice feature of character, no peculiarity in
      the ordering of a house, a garden or court-masque, could escape the notice of one whose mind
      was capable of taking in the whole world of knowledge.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>His understanding resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou gave to Prince Ahmed: fold
      it, and it seemed a toy for the hand of a lady; spread it, and the armies of powerful Sultans
      might repose beneath its shade.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>The knowledge in which Bacon excelled <pb n="122"/> all men was a knowledge of the mutual
      relations of all departments of knowledge.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>In a letter written when he was only thirty-one, to his uncle, Lord Burleigh, he said, "I
      have taken all knowledge to be my province."</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>Though Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic, he adorned her
      profusely with all the richest decorations of rhetoric.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>The practical faculty was powerful in Bacon; but not, like his wit, so powerful as
      occasionally to usurp the place of his reason, and to tyrannize over the whole man.</q>
    </p>
    <p>There are too many places in the Plays where this happens. Poor old dying John of Gaunt
     volleying second-rate puns at his own name, is a pathetic instance of it. "We may assume" that
     it is Bacon's fault, but the Stratford Shakespeare has to bear the blame. </p>
    <p><q>No imagination was ever at once so strong <pb n="123"/> and so thoroughly subjugated. It
      stopped at the first check from good sense.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>In truth much of Bacon's life was passed in a visionary world&mdash;amid things as strange
      as any that are described in the "Arabian Tales". . .amid buildings more sumptuous than the
      palace of Aladdin, fountains more wonderful than the golden water of Parizade, conveyances
      more rapid than the hippogryph of Ruggiero, arms more formidable than the lance of Astolfo,
      remedies more efficacious than the balsam of Fierabras. Yet in his magnificent day-dreams
      there was nothing wild&mdash;nothing but what sober reason sanctioned.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>Bacon's greatest performance is the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Novum
      Organum</hi>. . . .Every part of it blazes with wit, but with wit which is employed only to
      illustrate and decorate truth. No book ever made so great a revolution in the mode of
      thinking, overthrew so many prejudices, introduced so many new opinions.</q>
     <pb n="124"/>
    </p>
    <p><q>But what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellect which, without effort,
      takes in at once all the domains of science&mdash;all the past, the present and the future,
      all the errors of two thousand years, all the encouraging signs of the passing times, all the
      bright hopes of the coming age.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>He had a wonderful talent for packing thought close and rendering it portable.</q>
    </p>
    <p><q>His eloquence would alone have entitled him to a high rank in literature.</q>
    </p>
    <p>It is evident that he had each and every one of the mental gifts and each and every one of
     the acquirements that are so prodigally displayed in the Plays and Poems, and in much higher
     and richer degree than any other man of his time or of any previous time. He was a genius
     without a mate, a prodigy not matable. There was only one of him; the planet could not produce
     two of <pb n="125"/> him at one birth, nor in one age. He could have written anything that is
     in the Plays and Poems. He could have written this:</p>

    <q><lg type="verse">
      <l>The cloud-cap'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, </l>
      <l>The solemn temples, the great globe itself, </l>
      <l>Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, </l>
      <l>And, like an insubstantial pageant faded, </l>
      <l>Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff </l>
      <l>As dreams are made on, and our little life </l>
      <l>Is rounded with a sleep.</l>
     </lg></q>

    <p>Also, he could have written this, but he refrained:</p>

    <lg type="verse">
     <l>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare </l>
     <l>To digg the dust encloased heare: </l>
     <l>Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones </l>
     <l>And curst be ye yt moves my bones.</l>
    </lg>

    <p>When a person reads the noble verses about the cloud-cap'd towers, he ought not to follow it
     immediately with Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare, because <pb n="126"/> he will find the
     transition from poetry to poor prose too violent for comfort. It will give him a shock. You
     never notice how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is, until you bite into a layer of it in a
     pie.</p>

   </div1>
   <div1 type="chapter" id="d24">
    <head>XI </head>

    <p>AM I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare's Works? Ah, now,
     what do you take me for? Would I be so soft as that, after having known the human race
     familiarly for nearly seventy-four years? It would grieve me to know that any one could think
     so injuriously of me, so uncomplimentarily, so unadmiringly of me. No-no, I am aware that when
     even the brightest mind in our world has been trained up from childhood in a superstition of
     any kind, it will never be possible for that mind, in its maturity, to examine sincerely,
     dispassionately, and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance which shall seem to cast
     a <pb n="128"/> doubt upon the validity of that superstition. I doubt if I could do it myself.
     We always get at second hand our notion about systems of government; and high-tariff and
     low-tariff; and prohibition and anti-prohibition; and the holiness of peace and the glories of
     war; and codes of honor and codes of morals; and approval of the duel and disapproval of it;
     and our beliefs concerning the nature of cats; and our ideas as to whether the murder of
     helpless wild animals is base or is heroic; and our preferences in the matter of religious and
     political parties; and our acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares and the Arthur Ortons
     and the Mrs. Eddys. We get them all at second-hand, we reason none of them out for ourselves.
     It is the way we are made. It is the way we are all made, and we can't help it, we can't change
     it And whenever we have been furnished <pb n="129"/> a fetish, and have been taught to believe
     in it, and love it and worship it, and refrain from examining it, there is no evidence,
     howsoever clear and strong, that can persuade us to withdraw from it our loyalty and our
     devotion. In morals, conduct, and beliefs we take the color of our environment and
     associations, and it is a color that can safely be warranted to wash. Whenever we have been
     furnished with a tar baby ostensibly stuffed with jewels, and warned that it will be
     dishonorable and irreverent to disembowel it and test the jewels, we keep our sacrilegious
     hands off it. We submit, not reluctantly, but rather gladly, for we are privately afraid we
     should find, upon examination, that the jewels are of the sort that are manufactured at North
     Adams, Mass. </p>
    <p>I haven't any idea that Shakespeare will have to vacate his pedestal this side <pb n="130"/>
     of the year 2209. Disbelief in him cannot come swiftly, disbelief in a healthy and deeply-loved
     tar baby has never been known to disintegrate swiftly, it is a very slow process. It took
     several thousand years to convince our fine race&mdash;including every splendid intellect in
     it&mdash;that there is no such thing as a witch; it has taken several thousand years to
     convince that same fine race&mdash;including every splendid intellect in it&mdash;that there is
     no such person as Satan; it has taken several centuries to remove perdition from the Protestant
     Church's program of postmortem entertainments; it has taken a weary long time to persuade
     American Presbyterians to give up infant damnation and try to bear it the best they can; and it
     looks as if their Scotch brethren will still be burning babies in the everlasting fires when
     Shakespeare comes down from his perch. <pb n="131"/>
    </p>
    <p>We are The Reasoning Race. We can't prove it by the above examples, and we can't prove it by
     the miraculous "histories" built by those Stratfordolaters out of a hatful of rags and a barrel
     of sawdust, but there is a plenty of other things we can prove it by, if I could think of them.
     We are The Reasoning Race, and when we find a vague file of chipmunk-tracks stringing through
     the dust of Stratford village, we know by our reasoning powers that Hercules has been along
     there. I feel that our fetish is safe for three centuries yet. The bust, too&mdash;there in the
     Stratford Church. The precious bust, the priceless bust, the calm bust, the serene bust, the
     emotionless bust, with the dandy moustache, and the putty face, unseamed of care&mdash;that
     face which has looked passionlessly down upon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years
     and will still <pb n="132"/> look down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more, with the deep,
     deep, deep, subtle, subtle, subtle, expression of a bladder.</p>

     courtesy being repugnant to my nature and my dignity. The furthest I can go in that direction
     is to call them by names of limited reverence&mdash;names merely descriptive, never unkind,
     never offensive, never tainted by harsh feeling. If <hi rend="italic">they</hi> would do like
     this, they would feel better in their hearts. Very well, then to proceed. One of the most
     trying defects which I find in these Stratfordolaters, these <pb n="134"/> Shakesperoids, these
     thugs, these bangalores, these troglodytes, these herumfrodites, these blatherskites, these
     buccaneers, these bandoleers, is their spirit of irreverence. It is detectable in every
     utterance of theirs when they are talking about us. I am thankful that in me there is nothing
     of that spirit. When a thing is sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward
     it. I cannot call to mind a single instance where I have ever been irreverent, except toward
     the things which were sacred to other people. Am I in the right? I think so. But I ask no one
     to take my unsupported word; no, look at the dictionary; let the dictionary decide. Here is the
     definition: </p>
    <p><q><hi rend="italic">Irreverence.</hi> The quality or condition of irreverence toward God and
      sacred things.</q>
    </p>
    <p>What does the Hindu say? He says it is correct. He says irreverence is lack <pb n="135"/> of
     respect for Vishnu, and Brahma, and Chrishna, and his other gods, and for his sacred cattle,
     and for his temples and the things within them. He endorses the definition, you see; and there
     are 300,000,000 Hindus or their equivalents back of him. </p>
    <p>The dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital G it could restrict irreverence
     to lack of reverence for <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Deity and our sacred things, but that
     ingenious and rather sly idea miscarried: for by the simple process of spelling <hi
      rend="italic">his</hi> deities with capitals the Hindu confiscates the definition and
     restricts it to his own sects, thus making it clearly compulsory upon us to revere <hi
      rend="italic">his</hi> gods and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sacred things, and nobody's else.
     We can't say a word, for he has our own dictionary at his back, and its decision is final. </p>
    <p>This law, reduced to its simplest terms, is this: 1. Whatever is sacred to the <pb n="136"/>
     Christian must be held in reverence by everybody else; 2, whatever is sacred the Hindu must be
     held in reverence by everybody else; 3, therefore, by consequence, logically, and indisputably,
     whatever is sacred to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> must be held inreverence by everybody else. </p>
    <p>Now then, what aggravates me is, that these troglodytes and muscovites and bandoleers and
     buccaneers are <hi rend="italic">also</hi> trying to crowd in and share the benefit of the law,
     and compel everybody to revere their Shakespeare and hold him sacred. We can't have that:
     there's enough of us already. If you go on widening and spreading and inflating the privilege,
     it will presently come to be conceded that each man's sacred things are the <hi rend="italic"
      >only</hi> ones, and the rest of the human race will have to be humbly reverent toward them or
     suffer for it. That can surely happen, and when it happens, the word <pb n="137"/> Irreverence
     will be regarded as the most meaningless, and foolish, and self-conceited, and insolent, and
     impudent and dictatorial word in the language. And people will say, "Whose business is it, what
     gods I worship and what things I hold sacred? Who has the right to dictate to my conscience,
     and where did he get that right?" </p>
    <p>We cannot afford to let that calamity come upon us. We must save the word from this
     destruction. There is but one way to do it, and that is, to stop the spread of the privilege,
     and strictly confine it to its present limits: that is, to all the Christian sects, to all the
     Hindu sects, and me. We do not need any more, the stock is watered enough, just as it is. </p>
    <p>It would be better if the privilege were limited to me alone. I think so because I am the
     only sect that knows how to <pb n="138"/> employ it gently, kindly, charitably,
     dispassionately. The other sects lack the quality of self-restraint. The Catholic Church says
     the most irreverent things about matters which are sacred to the Protestants, and the
     Protestant Church retorts in kind about the confessional and other matters which Catholics hold
     sacred; then both of these irreverencers turn upon Thomas Paine and charge <hi rend="italic"
      >him</hi> with irreverence. This is all unfortunate, because it makes it difficult for
     students equipped with only a low grade of mentality to find out what Irreverence really <hi
      rend="italic">is.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>It will surely be much better all around if the privilege of regulating the irreverent and
     keeping them in order shall eventually be withdrawn from all the sects but me. Then there will
     be no more quarrelling, no more bandying of disrespectful epithets, no more heart burnings. <pb
      n="139"/>
    </p>
    <p>There will then be nothing sacred involved in this Bacon-Shakespeare controversy except what
     is sacred to me. That will simplify the whole matter, and trouble will cease. There will be
     irreverence no longer, because I will not allow it. The first time those criminals charge me
     with irreverence for calling their Stratford myth an
     Arthur-Orton-Mary-Baker-Thompson-Eddy-Louis-the-Seventeenth-Veiled-Prophet-of-Khorassan will be
     the last. Taught by the methods found effective in extinguishing earlier offenders by the
     Inquisition, of holy memory, I shall know how to quiet them.</p>

     <p>ISN'T it odd, when you think of it: that you may list all the celebrated Englishmen,
      Irishmen, and Scotchmen of modern times, clear back to the first Tudors&mdash;a list
      containing five hundred names, shall we say?&mdash;and you can go to the histories,
      biographies and encyclopedias and learn the particulars of the lives of every one of them.
      Every one of them except one&mdash;the most famous, the most renowned&mdash;by far the most
      illustrious of them all&mdash;Shakespeare! You can get the details of the lives of all the
      celebrated ecclesiastics in the list; the celebrated tragedians, comedians singers, dancers,

      celebrated of them all&mdash;Shakespeare! </p>
     <p>You may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons furnished by the rest of Christendom

      people, too. You will then have listed 1500 celebrities, and you can trace the authentic
      life-histories of the whole of them. Save one&mdash;far and away the most colossal prodigy of
      the entire accumulation&mdash;Shakespeare! About him you can find out <hi rend="italic"
       >nothing.</hi> Nothing of even the slightest importance. Nothing worth the trouble of stowing
      away in your memory. Nothing that even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than
      a distinctly common-place person&mdash;a manager, an actor of inferior grade, a small trader
      in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any consequence, and had forgotten
      all about him before he was fairly cold in his grave. We can go to the records and find out
      the life-history of every renowned <hi rend="italic">race-horse</hi> of modern times&mdash;but
      not Shakespeare's! There are many reasons why, and they have <pb n="143"/> been furnished in
      cartloads (of guess and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that is worth all
      the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly sufficient all by itself&mdash;<hi
       rend="italic">he hadn't any history to record.</hi> There is no way of getting around that
      deadly fact. And no sane way has yet been discovered of getting around its formidable
      significance. </p>
     <p>Its quite plain significance&mdash;to any but those thugs (I do not use the term unkindly)
      is, that Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived, and none until he had been dead two or
      three generations. The Plays enjoyed high fame from the beginning; and if he wrote them it
      seems a pity the world did not find it out. He ought to have explained that he was the author,
      and not merely a <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> for another man to hide behind. If he had
      been less intemperately solicitous about his bones, and more solicitous <pb n="144"/> about
      his Works, it would have been better for his good name, and a kindness to us. The bones were
      not important. They will moulder away, they will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until
      the last sun goes down.</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">P.S. March 25.</hi> About two months ago I was illuminating this
      Autobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, and I
      then took occasion to air the opinion that the Stratford Shakespeare was a person of no public
      consequence or celebrity during his lifetime, but was utterly obscure and unimportant. And not
      only in great London, but also in the little village where he was born, where he lived a
      quarter of a century, and where he died and was buried. I argued that if he had been a person
      of any note at <pb n="145"/> all, aged villagers would have had much to tell about him many
      and many a year after his death, instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact
      connected with him. I believed, and I still believe, that if he had been famous, his notoriety
      would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my native village out in Missouri. It is a
      good argument, a prodigiously strong one, and a most formidable one for even the most gifted,
      and ingenious, and plausible Stratfordolater to get around or explain away. To-day a Hannibal
       <hi rend="italic">Courier-Post</hi> of recent date has reached me, with an article in it
      which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated person cannot be forgotten in his
      village in the short space of sixty years. I will make an extract from it: </p>
     <p><q>Hannibal, as a city, may have many sins to answer for, but ingratitude is not one of <pb
        n="146"/> them, or reverence for the great men she has produced, and as the years go by her
       greatest son Mark Twain, or S. L. Clemens as a few of the unlettered call him, grows in the
       estimation and regard of the residents of the town he made famous and the town that made him
       famous. His name is associated with every old building that is torn down to make way for the
       modern structures demanded by a rapidly growing city, and with every hill or cave over or
       through which he might by any possibility have roamed, while the many points of interest
       which he wove into his stories, such as Holiday Hill, Jackson's Island, or Mark Twain Cave,
       are now monuments to his genius. Hannibal is glad of any opportunity to do him honor as he
       has honored her.</q>
     </p>
     <p><q>So it has happened that the "old timers" who went to school with Mark or were with him on
       some of his usual escapades have been honored with large audiences whenever they were in a
       reminiscent mood and condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to
       be a very extraordinary <pb n="147"/> humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen to have
       been indicative of what was to come. Like Aunt Beckey and Mrs. Clemens, they can now see that
       Mark was hardly appreciated when he lived here and that the things he did as a boy and was
       whipped for doing were not all bad after all. So they have been in no hesitancy about drawing
       out the bad things he did as well as the good in their efforts to get a "Mark Twain story,"
       all incidents being viewed in the light of his present fame, until the volume of "Twainiana"
       is already considerable and growing in proportion as the "old timers" drop away and the
       stories are retold second and third hand by their descendants. With some seventy-three years
       young and living in a villa instead of a house he is a fair target, and let him incorporate,
       copyright, or patent himself as he will, there are some of his "works" that will go swooping
       up Hannibal chimneys as long as graybeards gather about the fires and begin with "I've heard
       father tell" or possibly "Once when I."</q>
      <pb n="148"/>
     </p>
     <p>The Mrs. Clemens referred to is my mother&mdash;<hi rend="italic">was</hi> my mother. </p>
     <p>And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper. Of date twenty days ago: </p>
     <p><q>Miss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William Dickason, 408 Rock Street, at 2:30
       o'clock yesterday afternoon, aged 72 years. The deceased was a sister of "Huckleberry Finn,"
       one of the famous characters in Mark Twain's <hi rend="italic">Tom Sawyer.</hi> She had been
       a member of the Dickason family&mdash;the housekeeper&mdash;for nearly forty-five years, and
       was a highly respected lady. For the past eight years she had been an invalid, but was as
       well cared for by Mr. Dickason and his family as if she had been a near relative. She was a
       member of the Park Methodist Church and a Christian woman.</q>
     </p>
     <p>I remember her well. I have a picture of her in my mind which was graven there, clear and
      sharp and vivid, sixty-three <pb n="149"/> years ago, She was at that time nine years old, and
      I was about eleven. I remember where she stood, and how she looked; and I can still see her
      bare feet, her bare head, her brown face, and her short tow-linen frock. She was crying. What
      it was about, I have long ago forgotten. But it was the tears that preserved the picture for
      me, no doubt. She was a good child, I can say that for her. She knew me nearly seventy years
      ago. Did she forget me, in the course of time? I think not. If she had lived in Stratford in
      Shakespeare's time, would she have forgotten him? Yes. For he was never famous during his
      lifetime, he was utterly obscure in Stratford, and there wouldn't be any occasion to remember
      him after he had been dead a week. </p>
     <p>"Injun Joe," "Jimmy Finn," and "General Gaines" were prominent and <pb n="150"/> very
      intemperate ne'er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago. Plenty of grayheads there remember
      them to this day, and can tell you about them. Isn't it curious that two "town-drunkards" and
      one half-breed loafer should leave behind them, in a remote Missourian village, a fame a
      hundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in the matter of definite
      facts than Shakespeare left behind him in the village where he had lived the half of his
      lifetime?</p>
