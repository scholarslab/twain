<p>We have already alluded to Mark Twain's new book, "The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer."  The work has just been published, and is a most capital subject for a
holiday gift.  Like all of its author's works, it overflows with rare and quaint humor;
and, in addition to its attractive subject-matter, it has the advantage of being bound
very handsomely, printed on heavy tinted paper, and beautified with 150 illustrations,
and is to be obtained at a far lower price than Twain's other works.  It contains about
300 pages.  The lady agent for this city may be found at 88 Court Street, where any
subscriber omitted by her may obtain the book. . . .
