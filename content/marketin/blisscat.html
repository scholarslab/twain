        <p>This four-page list of the American Publishing Company's
        books, as of 1876, isn't illustrated. But it does provide a
        good picture of the kinds of books that were being
        published "by subscription only," and of the way agents
        were solicited. MT's books are on the first two pages. On
        the fourth page is a disingenuous defense of the cost of
        subscription books, addressed "To the Public."</p>
