  <p>MT's preoccupation with what others were saying about his
  various performances led him to spend a lot of time with
  scrapbooks. That was how he came to discover a way to improve the
  scrapbook by making it self-pasting. In 1872 he patented the idea
  and marketed it as "Mark Twain's Patent Scrapbook." In 1881 he
  said in a letter to Charles Webster that "the scrapbook gravels
  me because while [the company producing it has] been paying me
  about 1800 or 2000 a year, I judge it ought to have been 3 times
  as much." In any case, this one MT book with no words in it was
  probably his most lucrative: according to an item in <i>The St.
  Louis Post-Dispatch</i> (8 June 1885), he had made $200,000 from
  all his other books, and $50,000 from the scrapbook alone.</p>

  <p>There is an unused copy of this "text" in the Barrett
  Collection. <i>Below</i> is one version of the four-page pamphlet MT
  designed to advertise it.  Clicking on the image <i>at left</i> will take you to another advertising pamphlet from 
Kevin Mac Donnell's exhibit of "<font size="-1">MT COLLECTIBLES</font>."</p><br />
