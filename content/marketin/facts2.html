        <p><font size="+1"><b>Facts</b>, By a Woman</font> <i>is
        the promising title of an anonymously published account of
        being a subscription book seller in California in the
        1870s. The "</i>Woman<i>" was really Harriet Wasson, who
        was born in 1842 in Wooster, Ohio. By "</i>Facts<i>" she
        means the antidote to innuendo. The occasion for her book
        is defined at the start by the remark of a woman, made to
        other women, about a woman book agent she has just turned
        away from her door:</i> "I cannot, for the life of me, see
        how any woman that has the least sort of respect for
        herself can engage in such an occupation. Why the very idea
        is enough to repel a pure-minded person."</p>

        <p><i>Before becoming a book agent, Wasson notes she tried
        unsuccessfully to support herself selling something called
        "plaiting machines" house-to-house; apparently that was
        more reputable because her customers would have been women,
        whereas selling books regularly brought her into contact
        with men customers. Although her account shows that even
        buyers of a book like</i> Tom Sawyer <i>sometimes had
        ulterior, adult motives for dealing with her, she ends</i>
        Facts <i>with a declaration of her profession's
        respectability:</i></p>

        <blockquote>
          "I solicited from basements to garrets, and sold books in
          both, to rich and poor men, roughs and gentlemen; and
          think I have climbed steps enough to land me in
          heavenland, and am just as far away from the goodly
          place, but not any farther, than when I first began my
          sad departure; for I received many good lessons, and some
          of the very best, from the roughest masters, and when
          least expected. And although temptations and insults
          greeted me, I would also have received them if stationed
          behind any village or city store counter, in any
          permanent establishment. And I saw no reason why I should
          not or could not work in that capacity as well as men,
          and support myself, and respectably, too. "
        </blockquote>

        <p><i>The first book she ever peddled door-to-door was</i>
        Tom Sawyer<i>. The following excerpt from her account of
        that experience is a bit breathlessly written, but it also
        provides good firsthand evidence about the subscription
        system. It indicates the kinds of things that counted with
        MT's subscription audience, and how MT's first novel was
        received in a small California mining town called Oroville
        -- another promising title.</i></p>

      <td>
        <p>Debating the question of ways and means, . . . I was
        prompted instinctively to pick up a city newspaper . . . my
        visionary mind was mechanically drawn down through its
        newsy page to a single item of distinctive meaning, so
        electrifying and magically warming my freezing
        life-current, that I was instantly thrown into complete
        respiration and retroaction. It was a simple announcement,
        an advertisement only, of A. Roman &amp; Co., who wanted
        agents to canvass "Tom Sawyer," Mark Twain's new book. I
        had been led to it by a mysterious guidance . . . .</p>

        <p>I seized my writing material immediately and wrote to
        the firm, asking for the prospectus book, and the town of
        Oroville as territory to work upon. . . .</p>

        <p>Night came again, and with it the evening stage, bearing
        that haven of hope, the mail bag, which brought me a
        prospectus book and a letter of instructions from A. Roman
        &amp; Co. They gave me Oroville, as I had so desired, and
        fortune, ever treacherous, smiled upon me again. All my
        sweet-scented nightshades of the evening before were at a
        great discount. I extended the illuminating facility of my
        chamber to its fullest capacity, and with book in hand I
        longed for more light, while I waltzed off into a happy
        maze, under the influence of the tuneful liar, "Mark Twain"
        . . .</p>

        <p>My prospectus book proved very disconnected reading, but
        I found matter sufficiently interesting to keep me engaged
        long enough to consume my allowance of candlelight . .
        .</p>

        <p>Monday morning came, with a hard rain, which kept me at
        home all day. I was glad, indeed, that it did rain, as it
        gave me time to prepare myself for that demoralizing field
        I was about to enter.</p>

        <p>Tuesday dawned clearly and bright, and after paying
        extra attention to my toilet, I began, with far greater
        agitation, to canvass the town again [i.e. after trying to
        sell her plaiting machine]. As my machines simply showed
        their own desirable qualities to ladies that wanted to buy,
        it was easy work to sell them; but the books, and to
        gentlemen, required a different tale; and I was ignorant
        enough of both to make anybody happy. I had examined my
        prospectus sufficiently to know that it was a book intended
        for youthful minds, and all in reading-life, clean through
        to the oldest age, and I felt capable to give it a passable
        showing.</p>

        <p>. . . In accordance with the . . . instructions . . . of
        my guiding pamphlet, which I had received in connection
        with my evil outfit from the city furnishing establishment,
        I began my corruptive employment among the officials and
        leading men of business, going to the Court House first,
        for influential names.</p>

        <p>. . . As I stood there, staring in simplest attitudes of
        simplest country breeding, and fresh, too, apparently, from
        a genuine farm, while pliantly bending with the breathing
        atmosphere of those tremendous city bodies that I had dared
        to face. I leaned over to the nearest one to me, and tried
        to tell him my business in town; he seemed to understand
        me, and wrote me his name on the order page. He was one of
        the county officers, I have forgotten which, but his name
        was Armstrong. An appropriate name, I thought, for with a
        strong arm he dashed down an order for a book that would
        give the most money, one in morocco binding. Seeing that I
        bowed to him first, he said, in passing the prospectus back
        to me:</p>

        <p>"There, I have given you a good send-off."</p>

        <p>I appreciated his kindness more than he was aware of.
        The two expectant dollars I would get for my commission on
        that finely-bound book lent a charm, and helped me complete
        my call in that dreaded house of law without any more fear,
        which left me through kindly treatment. I received five
        subscribers, and went home to dinner feeling more happy
        than otherwise.</p>

        <p>After noon I tried again in private offices, getting in
        all eleven subscribers, which was good wages and not hard
        work for a new beginner. I had been treated by all with
        sincere respect, meeting with nothing unpleasant, as
        expected insults, or I was happily too ignorant to observe
        any if offered. And I retired at night feeling more at
        peace with mankind generally than I anticipated, and I
        slept sweetly.</p>

        <p>The next day I started out with an average amount of
        assurance, and went boldly into the first business place,
        after leaving the hotel. I worked along till noontime,
        receiving an order in one place, none perhaps in the next;
        promises, too, by the wary men who were sensitive about
        being caught outright without plenty of company, and would
        request me to call again, at a later day; and I did not
        disappoint them by a second visit, though chagrined myself
        in doing so.</p>

        <p>After dinner I went out especially to find "George C.
        Perkins," as nearly everybody told me to go to him, they
        knew he would subscribe for a book. . . I addressed myself
        to him, begging to be excused for interrupting the
        conversation, told him that I was soliciting orders for
        "Mark Twain's" new book, and I should be pleased to add his
        name to my list of subscribers. The gallant "George" took
        my book, while a thrill of pleasure crept over me as he
        gracefully turned the leaves, but, only to creep back
        again, with a changed feeling; another thrill of
        disappointment as he gently closed my prospectus and
        tenderly passed it back to me, assuring me as he did so,
        that he would gladly give me his name, were he not already
        the happy possessor of one. Too late again, I sighed; but
        he spoke favorably of the book, and was doubtless the means
        of getting me other subscribers, which was the next best
        thing he could do for me . . . Our Governor, being ahead
        then as now, had purchased "Tom Sawyer" some weeks before,
        from Roman &amp; Co., in San Francisco . . .</p>

        <p>Saturday concluded my order taking, with a pleasing
        incident that often comes back to me in my day visions. I
        had canvassed all places except a few scattering houses
        that were located on a street leading out from the town
        through some old gold mines. Yes, it was old gold, still
        alive and fashionable, but alas, buried. I was walking
        along, looking over the sad scene and deeply regretting
        that anything so ornamental and very necessary as that
        precious metal should be covered away in that cold, ugly
        ground. I paused mournfully, when a little boy came running
        up to me saying:--</p>

        <p>"Say, say, will yer lem'me see yer book?"</p>

        <p>"Certainly," I replied, turning to a picture as I handed
        it to him.</p>

        <p>"Oh, that's Tom! Isn't it?" And he looked with delight,
        talking on, "I've been wantin' dad to buy me one, and he
        said he would if he had more money than he knowed what do
        do with. That don't look much like gettin it though, does
        it? Some boys told me about 'Tom Sawyer' -- said he and
        some other fellers went to their own funerals; gol! musn't
        that a been fun? . . ."</p>

        <p>It was Saturday night. I sent an order to the city for
        books, and concluded to go to the town of Cherokee Flat and
        canvass that place while waiting for my books . . .</p>

        <p><a name="a" id="a">I found my</a> books, fifty-seven in
        number, awaiting me for delivery. . . . I rested until
        Monday, and read for the first time the book I had been
        soliciting orders for; I was so disappointed in the size of
        the complete work that it afforded me anything but the
        pleasure I had anticipated through my perusal. The
        tantalizing gaps of the prospectus were connected only by a
        very short literary thread, and I was attacked by a
        thousand fears. I had been representing it, as the Nevada
        Indian says: "A heap great big large" book and I felt that
        the whole bottom had dropped right out of my pan, and lost
        all my gold right there in the very place where I was
        digging for it . . . I thought the people would not take
        the books as I had lied so about them, and I would be out
        in the cold completely, with no money, and nothing but a
        deceptive lot of, to me, worthless books. I found that
        soliciting names and delivering were two separate and
        distinct occupations. I was always happy when receiving my
        orders, for my business in that form was then complete;
        but, in delivering my books, I must call for money; and
        could I always get it? A ghostly admonition answered
        emphatically, No!</p>

        <p>Monday morning I appeared before that public again with
        a weaker heart then ever before. My books had been
        consigned to a merchant, and I went to him with tottering
        footsteps. As I was paying him for a few that I intended to
        carry out, that Jewish proprietor remarked to me:</p>

        <p>"Dem pooks ish tam shmall!"</p>

        <p>"Yes," I said, "but they are good, though." I did not
        say "tam," but I thought it. I gathered them under my
        wings, as any hen might do, for they were little enough,
        being fresh hatched to me, and started out with my
        brood.</p>

        <p>I expected to be destroyed completely by those dangerous
        hawks, my subscribers, while protecting my young with a
        tremulous flutter, as I crossed the street, aiming for rest
        and shelter in the safe beyond. The bank was open. I
        deposited my chicks on the counter, in plain view of those
        whom I felt were obliged to relieve me; and shades of
        disappointment swept over the brow of each one as they
        gauged the dimensions of the group I brought them. They
        received them though, and paid me, owing probably to their
        being early Spring, and a dainty lot. I was delivered from
        my torturing pack most joyfully, and went back to the nest
        for another supply. I lost no time in getting through with
        that uncertain delivery work; in two days of constant
        flitting back and forth before the awful footlights, the
        curtain went down over my third and last act in Oroville;
        and I could truthfully say that I was as much displeased
        with the closing scene as any of my patronizing observers;
        for there was nothing at all agreeable to me except the
        money I received, which seemed little enough considering my
        worriment.</p>

        <p>Everybody was disappointed by the smallness of their
        books; but they all took them except one lady. The merchant
        told me that she was perfectly good, and feeling so sure of
        her taking the book, as she had expressed herself
        particularly anxious to get one, I deferred going to her
        until I was through with other subscribers more doubtful.
        My newly born had been gaining in strength, and I had
        ceased to think or worry about its youthful appearance.
        When I tried to present that goodly woman with her
        long-looked-for child, "Tom Sawyer," which she measured by
        a glance and absolutely refused to foster, I told her that
        she must take it, as I had ordered it expressly for her by
        her own desire.</p>

        <p>"Well," she said, "I have not got the money now, but if
        you will come this afternoon I will receive the book and
        pay you for it."</p>

        <p>I called as requested; she was not at home; and she kept
        playing "not at home" till I beat her at that game with my
        persistence, when she changed the programme by opening the
        door just wide enough to tell me:</p>

        <p>"I will not take the book, and you need not come here
        again!"</p>

        <p>I felt more angry than surprised at her treatment. She
        was a devout member of the leading Christian Church, and I
        had seen a few of those purely good women before, like her,
        always so good -- to themselves. . . .</p>

        <center>
          [<i>She finishes delivering copies of</i> Tom Sawyer
          <i>in both Oroville and Cherokee Flats, then returns to
          her room.</i>]
        </center>

        <p>. . . As I was going up the hotel steps <i>en route</i>
        to my room, I passed a gentleman, one of my subscribers,
        who had received and paid me for his book, and I was
        perfectly willing to let him pass me on the stairs, or any
        place else, as I had my money. Finding my room rather
        close, as it was a warm day, I threw open the window, by
        which I sat down to cool my throbbing brow . . . I was
        looking off over the town into Feather River, and thinking
        what a beautiful stream it would be were its rapidly
        flowing waters free from the mud and mining debris that
        seemed clogging its lively existence, when sounds of voices
        were wafted through the gaping sash, attracting my
        attention from river view reveries. By the deep, low tones,
        I knew they were masculine, and that there were two of
        them.</p>

        <p>"Bob, what's the matter?" came plainly to my hearing, as
        if the words had been addressed to me.</p>

        <p>"Nothing."</p>

        <p>"Nothing! that's too big a sigh you're heaving up there
        for nothing! Bob? What is it? Broke again?"</p>

        <p>"Yes, dead!"</p>

        <p>"What game?"</p>

        <p>"Oh, that mancincher, woman! of course."</p>

        <p>"Pshaw, Bob! come along, old boy, and let's have a
        drink."</p>

        <p>The sighing voice of Bob was familiar to me, it had gone
        down the stairway as I came up. The voices ceased, but the
        breezes came and went, fanning refreshingly while still I
        sat, holding on to my money, in happy tranquility. The
        winds grew stronger, and I was about to draw down the
        casement, when I became a listener again, through the same
        tell-tale source, to voices more distinct than before.</p>

        <p>"Jim, what do you think of that book agent, anyhow?"</p>

        <p>"Think! I don't think nothing about it, she's another
        cussed bilk!"</p>

        <p>"Oh, I see, Jim; you are out three or four dollars
        again."</p>

        <p>"Five, by G--d! damn the women!"</p>

        <p>I recognized the despondent "Jim." He had bought "Tom
        Sawyer" in full dress morrocco, expecting me to -- "Come
        into the garden, Maude." I was so pleased that I would have
        liked to turn myself into an American flag and hoist myself
        on a liberty pole in full mast, where I could, with entire
        freedom, wave out into ripples of joy at that one complete
        victory.</p>
