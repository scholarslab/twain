        <p>The point of the subscription system was to sell a book
        before it was published. It was MT's policy, in fact, not
        to publish a work until 40,000 copies had been sold.
        Neither the agent selling it nor the reader buying it could
        see a work like <i>Huck Finn</i> as we know the text. They
        relied on the prospectus of the novel.</p><a href=

        align="left" hspace="9" alt ="DETAIL: FANCY COVER" /></a>

        <p>Sometimes called a "canvassing book" or a "sales dummy,"
        a prospectus was put together by a publisher out of sample
        pages from a forthcoming book. It was designed to catch a
        consumer's eye, so the cover was often quite fancy (as you
        can see from this cover of the prospectus of <i>Life on the
        Mississippi</i>), and the book's illustrations were often
        more prominently featured than its text. Agents were
        instructed to keep the prospectus in their own hands, while
        displaying various pictures and reading selected passages
        to the customer. Once someone had agreed to purchase,
        agents offered them samples of the different bindings
        available, always making sure to recommend the most
        expensive options -- as one agent's manual put it, "These
        not only <i>pay the Agent</i> far the best, but the
        <font size="-1">CUSTOMER</font> is invariably <i>better
        satisfied</i>." (The sample bindings and the list of prices
        for <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> are displayed
        below.)</p><a href=
        "javascript:Start('missbnd1.html')"><img src="missbnd1.gif"
        align="right" hspace="9" alt ="DETAIL: BINDING SAMPLES (1)" /></a>

        <p>It's not clear what direct role MT played in deciding
        which parts of his works to include in the prospectuses. He
        certainly appreciated their importance. When <i>Huck
        Finn</i> was in production at his own publishing company,
        MT wrote Charles Webster: "As fast as [the illustrator]
        gets through with the chapters, take them &amp; read &amp;
        select your matter for your canvassing book. . . .
        Remember," he added, referring to the prospectus for
        <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> displayed here, "Osgood
        fooled away no end of time on his canvassing book, &amp;
        <i>then</i> got out one that was eminently calculated to
        destroy the sale."</p>

        <p>MT's last remark indicates how much the prospectuses of
        his books reveal about the dynamics of his career. Because
        they were calculated to present MT's works as attractively
        as possible, from their contents we can see how his books
        were defined for the public that MT originally wrote them
        for. It is a crude but graphic index to what MT and his
        publishers thought his audience would like about a
        particular text.</p><a href=
        "javascript:Start('missbnd2.html')"><img src="missbnd2.gif"
        align="left" hspace="9" alt ="DETAIL: BINDING SAMPLES (2)" /></a>

        <p>A prospectus re-presents the work of literature as a
        commodity in a very blunt way -- though frankness is not
        its chief characteristic. As with the famous "Notice" MT
        attached to the front of <i>Huck Finn</i>, in creating a
        prospectus MT and his publishers were perfectly willing to
        mislead potential readers. The main goal was to suggest how
        much -- in size and weight as well as amusement and
        instruction -- buyers will get for their money. Little
        effort was made to preserve anything like the aesthetic
        integrity of a work, so that, for example, the prospectus
        of <i>Innocents Abroad</i> features in the beginning many
        serious full-page illustrations of scenes from the Holy
        Land -- even though the narrative doesn't get there until
        the end, and even though MT's text treats those same scenes
        in a very different spirit. Religious works were an early
        staple of subscription firms, and an agent could use the
        prospectus of <i>Innocents</i> to sell the book that
        way.</p><a href=
        "javascript:Start('missadv.html')"><img src="missadv.gif"
        align="right" hspace="9" alt ="DETAIL: LIST OF PRICES" /></a>

        <p>It's also surprising to see how little effort a
        prospectus makes to arouse a curiosity that can only be
        satisfied by buying the book. In some sense the modern
        equivalent to the prospectus is the movie preview, but
        movie previews would never give away the whole story as,
        for example, the prospectus of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> does, when
        its sample pages include Tom rescuing Becky from the cave,
        <i>and</i> the death of Joe, <i>and</i> the fact that Tom
        finds the treasure. The apparent indifference of MT and his
        publishers to this way of hooking a audience can probably
        be attributed to the typical character of subscription
        books before MT used the system to market his novels. The
        typical big subscription book wasn't conceived as an
        aesthetic whole, or a particular kind of reading
        experience, but as a kind of bulk package consisting of
        elegant binding, good paper and copious illustrations held
        together by some kind of text. If the subscription system
        encouraged MT to write in certain ways, I think it
        encouraged his readers to read in certain ways too -- ways
        that a consideration of the prospectuses which mediated
        between MT and his readers can help us appreciate. For this
        reason the archive reproduces the prospectuses for <a href=
        "../innocent/dummyhom.html"><i>Innocents Abroad</i></a>,
        and <a href=
        "../roughingit/prospect/riproshp.html"><i>Roughing
        It</i></a>, and <a href="../tomsawye/tomdumhp.html"><i>Tom
