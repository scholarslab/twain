        <p>Measured against what we know as media hype, the
        strategies MT and his publishers devised for calling
        attention to his books seem pretty quiet. By the standards
        of his time, however, MT believed in aggressively promoting
        their sales. <a href="javascript:Start2('exchfrev.html')">A reviewer
        of <i>Huck Finn</i></a>, for example, could say that "no
        book has been put on the market with more advertising."</p>

      <td>Subscription publishers spent little money on
      conventional newspaper or magazine advertisements, but MT and
      his publishers did create various kinds of posters. These
      were included in the prospectus, presumably to allow agents
      graphically to illustrate their sales pitch. But such posters
      also exist in unbound states, indicating that they were
      distributed in other ways. Because the sales of <i>Tom
      Sawyer</i> were so slow, for example, Bliss apparently sent
      flyers to all the customers whose names and addresses he'd
      acquired through earlier canvasses. And the Barrett
      Collection has an <a href="occident.html">advertising flyer
      for Huck Finn</a> printed by Occidental Publishing, the San
      Francisco firm that handled west coast distribution for
      Bliss. Except for the firm name, however, it's identical to
      the poster bound into the prospectus, which confirms the
      assumption that national publicity was controlled from
      Hartford, and thus makes it likely that MT himself would have
      usually known the details of each promotional campaign
      (including, for example, the decision to insist that
      <i>Huck</i> was written in "Mark Twain's old style," and was
      above all a funny book). The four items about <i>The Prince
      and the Pauper</i> here are from the Osgood &amp; Co.
      prospectus for the book, and display more graphic flair than
      either Bliss's or Webster's posters.

One of the less scrupulous practices of subscription
      firms was to retitle a book from their backlist, and send
      agents out to sell it again -- in some cases to people who
      had already bought it. Because of this practice, MT felt it
      increased the salability of a book to be able to say that
      none of it had ever appeared in print before. Thus he was
      reluctant at first to allow magazines to publish any part of
      his novels in advance of their canvass. But Richard Gilder,
      editor of <i>The Century</i>, talked him into <a href=
      "../huckfinn/hfcentry.html">pre-publishing parts of <i>Huck
      Finn</i></a> in his magazine, and <i>Huck</i> became a
      best-seller. This experience, and the growing need for cash,
      led MT regularly to include magazine publication in his
      marketing campaigns. <a href=
      "../yankee/centryhp.html">Selections from <i>Connecticut
      Yankee</i></a> appeared in a single installment, but all of
      <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, and many of the other late works,
      were pre-published in serial installments.</td>

      <td>Across the course of his career MT and his publishers
      discovered other ways to promote a new book. MT was a popular
      lecturer before he was a publishing author, and performed in
      front of live audiences for many reasons. But beginning with
      his first major eastern tour, <a href=
      "../innocent/vandhp.html">"The American Vandal Abroad,"</a>
      which was "smouched" from the text of <i>Innocents</i>, MT
      realized how a speaking tour could help advertise and sell
      his books. On 7 January 1869, in the midst of that tour, he
      advised Bliss to "issue prospectuses and startling
      advertisements now while I am stirring the bowels of these
      communities." This seems to anticipate the idea of a modern
      "book promotion tour." Bliss was unprepared to coordinate
      publishing and live appearances in such a fashion, but
      occasionally, as when MT was lecturing on "Our Fellow
      Savages" in Poughkeepsie, <a href="blitz.html">a kind of
      media blitz</a> happened anyway.</td>

      <td>After touring each winter from 1868 to 1872, MT grew
      tired of the demands of a season on the lecture circuit. But
      he remained interested in using his public performances to
      promote his books. His most successful lectures during the
      1871-1872 season were drawn from <i>Roughing It</i>, which
      was, as he could let audiences know, about to appear in
      print. And in 1884 he returned to the lecture circuit in order to promote the publication of <i>Huck
      Finn</i> by his own publishing company; during his <a href=
      "../huckfinn/hftourhp.html">multi-city tour with George Washington Cable
      Cable</a> he invariably performed selections from the novel. Programs for the performance often described these performances as  "advance sheets"
      from MT's forthcoming book.</td>

      <td>Another promotional device was "Pudd'nhead Wilson's
      Calendar," brought out by the <i>Century</i> to help
      advertise the serial appearance of the novel. <a href=
      "../wilson/pwadshp.html">The whole calendar, in two variant
      forms</a>, is in the <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> section of the
      archive. The signed copy of the calendar at left was a gift
      from MT to Bram Stoker. In his signature, MT is making the
      same identification many reviewers and readers also made --
      between himself and Pudd'nhead.</td>
