        <p>Knowing How. You have been appointed one of our agents,
        and we take it for granted that you <i>intend to
        succeed</i>. This is right. But you must also <i>know
        how</i>. We can show you how if you will let us. Will you
        do this? If so, and you will <font size=
        "-1">PRACTICE</font> what you learn, we unhesitatingly
        promise you success.</p>

        <p>Canvassing includes <i>five progressive steps</i> taken
        in the following natural order:<br />
        First:--Thorough preparation.<br />
        Second:--Securing influence.<br />
        Third:--Gaining a hearing.<br />
        Fourth:--Creating a desire.<br />
        Fifth:--Taking the order.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <p>Something that will Surprise You. You think very highly
        of your book. Of course you do, or you would not canvass
        for it. You will be surprised, therefore, to be told that
        you do not more than <i>half appreciate it</i>. Yet the
        chances are twenty to one that such is the case. And this
        is no reflection upon either your intelligence or your good
        faith. It is simply another way of saying that you have not
        yet <i>thoroughly studied</i> your book. <i>You must be
        interested yourself, or you cannot interest others; and the
        way for you to become interested, is to</i> <font size=
        "-1">KNOW</font> <i>your book</i> <font size=
        "-1">THOROUGHLY</font>.</p>

        <p>Command of what You Know. What an array of <font size=
        "-1">STRONG POINTS</font> you will discover your book to
        possess! By "strong points," we mean interesting features,
        valuable features, features that will help you <i>sell
        it</i>. But can you properly <i>impress your views on</i>
        others? Unless you are an apt salesman, and have experience
        besides, you <i>can not</i>. You have yet to acquire
        <i>perfect mastery</i> of what you know, and this can only
        come from <font size="-1">PRACTICE</font>. Remember that in
        canvassing you must think rapidly, talk fluently, and show
        your book to the <i>best advantage</i>; and all this, too,
        without <i>apparent</i> effort.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <p>Influential Names to Head your List. These you <i>must
        secure</i>, cost what effort it may. Right here is the
        <font size="-1">GREAT TURNING POINT OF SUCCESS</font>.
        Every old Agent understands this perfectly. Do not imagine
        that you are smart enough, or lucky enough to prove an
        exception to the invariable rule. <i>You are not.</i> Start
        right. Get a few leading names to head your list, and your
        success is assured. This is not <i>theory</i>. It is a
        <i>fact, philosophy</i>, <font size="-1">UNIVERSAL
        EXPERIENCE</font>. Society everywhere follows its leaders.
        The great majority of people are afraid to trust their own
        unaided judgment about buying a book; but show them that
        Dr. A. and Rev. Mr. B., or Judge C. and Professor D., or
        Colonel E. and Esquire F. -- or better still, all of these
        -- have taken your work, and you will decide them
        immediately. They will feel really <i>proud</i> to be on
        your list in <i>such</i> company.</p>

        <p>Keep a Good Heart and be Careful. Do not be discouraged
        if you should not get the names of <i>all</i> those you
        first selected to head your list. Perhaps you have enough
        as it is; if not, select others, and secure <i>them</i>.
        But on <i>no account</i> permit yourself to begin with
        <i>inferior</i> names; and if, by chance, any such should
        offer at this stage, have them put down on the <i>third</i>
        or <i>fourth</i> page of your order book. If one of the
        most influential "leaders" happens to be out of town,
        <i>reserve</i> a line for his name at the <i>head</i> of
        the list. When you at last find him, you can turn this to
        good account, and make of it an extremely neat and
        <i>effective</i> compliment.</p>

        <p>Testimonials. Secure all of these that you can, from
        persons of <i>influence</i> at every stage of the canvass,
        but especially in starting. They carry the <i>most</i>
        weight when written on a separate sheet, but it will
        sometimes be easier to get them by handing your order book
        to the individual, and letting him write in that what he
        wishes to say. Testimonials should always be <i>brief</i>
        and <i>to the point</i>. Two or three <i>strong, ringing
        adjectives,</i> in characterizing your book, are worth more
        than a page of <i>description</i> of it. Always be ready to
        suggest the wording of a testimonial yourself, in case you
        should be called upon, or find it advisable to do this.</p>

        <p>How to Carry Your Outfit. Gentlemen should have a large
        pocket on the inside of the coat, directly under the arm,
        in which to carry it. This will not only be very
        convenient, but serve to keep out of sight what might
        excite prejudice, by telling in advance what your business
        is, and thus preventing you from obtaining a fair hearing.
        To make such a pocket, without cutting the garment, make a
        bag large enough for the book, and put two button-holes
        hear the upper edge; then sew two buttons on the inside of
        your garment, and button the bag on.</p>

        <p>Lady agents should carry their outfit in a satchel under
        a loose wrap.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <p>Keep the Book in Your Own Hands. Possession is power.
        Surrender the book, and you lose the power of showing it.
        You will be led, instead of leading. This you must NEVER
        willingly permit. Strive to "keep the upper hand" all
        through. As nearly as possible, do all the thinking,
        talking, deciding, that there is to be done,
        <i>yourself</i>. Aim to make your <font size=
        "-1">INFLUENCE</font> a <i>controlling</i> one.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <p>Making the Most of Your Points. Not all your points will
        tell as you thought they would. But some of them will, and
        this is all you want. Books are seldom bought for what they
        are as a whole, but for some <i>particular feature</i> or
        <i>features</i> they contain. And tastes differ. Acquire
        the faculty of judging beforehand what will most
        <i>strike</i> different kinds of customers. Many subscribe
        because their neighbors have done so. <i>The array of
        signatures</i> brings to your aid the mighty influence of
        example, and has a kind of mesmeric power. M<font size=
        "-1">AKE THE MOST OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION LIST IN ALL
        CASES</font>. It will generally do more than all your
        previous talking.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <p>What Binding to Sell. If your book is published in
        several bindings, always sell one of the <i>higher
        priced</i> ones, if possible. There is no better evidence
        of <i>good work</i> in canvassing, than a large percentage
        of orders for the finer bindings. These not only <i>pay the
        Agent</i> far the best, but the <font size=
        "-1">CUSTOMER</font> is invariably <i>better satisfied</i>
        with his bargain.</p>

        <p>Your Manner and Address. Much depends upon these--more,
        perhaps, than upon anything else, or <i>all</i> things else
        combined. Your bearing should be open, frank, and manly, as
        of one who feels the true nobleness of his calling--never
        that of crouching servility or testiness, nor yet of
        overbearing and dogmatism. Show that you believe heartily
        in your book yourself, and are conscious of being engaged
        in an honorable and laudable undertaking in aiding its
        circulation.</p>

        <p>The Secret of Large Profits. Canvass closely,
        thoroughly, <i>exhaustively</i>. This is the <i>great
        secret</i> of money-making in the book business. It may
        require <i>much longer</i> to canvass a given territory
        than you expected. Never mind; <i>take</i> the time. Your
        business is not getting over territory. It is <i>selling
        books</i>, and the more books you can place <i>in a given
        area, the more money you will make</i>. Nearly all
        beginners in this business work too fast. Guard this point.
        Do not slight one family, office, store, or shop because
        you think yourself hurried. And see that you spend enough
        time in each to show your book <i>properly</i>.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <p>After canvassing a town or village, do not fly off at a
        tangent to some remote portion of your field, but continue
        working gradually outward, first on one road, and then on
        another. By this means you will keep constantly where your
        subscribers are well known, and where the <font size=
        "-1">INFLUENCE OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION LIST</font> will,
        therefore, be of the greatest value to you. Show a man the
        names of half his neighbors upon your book, and you bring
        to bear a tremendous leverage upon him; but twice as many
        names from another locality may fail to move him at
        all.</p>

          <b>ORDERING BOOKS</b>
        </center>

        <p>Do Not Be in a Hurry to Begin Delivering. New agents
        very frequently want to begin delivering books as soon as
        they have canvassed three or four days, or a week, and
        obtained from twenty to thirty subscribers. This is a grand
        mistake. The way to make the business pay is to do it on a
        <i>wholesale</i> scale, to the utmost possible extent, and
        not fritter away time and labor by doing everything in a
        petty way. The saving of expense (in freights, etc.) is
        only one of the <i>minor</i> advantages which you will gain
        by ordering and delivering in lots as large as possible.
        The greatest gain, perhaps, will be your <i>saving of
        time</i>. Remember, canvassing is your main business;
        delivering is an <i>interruption</i>. One delivery of a 100
        books will yield you a <i>net profit from two to four
        times</i> greater than ten deliveries of 10 books each.
        Professional canvassers generally work up an entire town or
        township, before ordering books.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <center>
          <b>DELIVERING BOOKS</b>
        </center>

        <p>The Philosophy of Delivering. This is very simple, viz.:
        There is a <i>contract</i> existing between your subscriber
        and yourself. You perform your part of this contract by
        delivering the book. You expect him to fulfill his part by
        receiving and paying therefor. It is purely a business
        transaction. Never treat it by word, look or manner, as
        though it could possibly be anything else. <i>Never</i>
        say, "I have brought your book; I <i>hope</i> you are ready
        to take it;" nor anything of similar import. Never let a
        customer impose upon your <i>good nature</i>, or "back out"
        from his bargain on <i>any</i> pretext, except for reasons
        the most conclusive, and based on circumstances for which
        he is in no wise responsible.</p>

        <p>Serving the Book. Let your manner be courteous, but
        thoroughly self-possessed and decided. In a word, be
        business-like. Never show the least misgiving that the
        customer will give you trouble. Say that you have brought
        his book, as per agreement, and he will find it a treasure
        indeed (or something of that kind). Look him full in the
        face and hand him the book.</p>
        <hr width="65%" />

        <p>If you are told that people won't buy anything
        now-a-days that they can't use, call to mind the
        <i>useful</i> and <i>valuable</i> features of your
        book.</p>

        <p>If you are told that <i>so many</i> books are being
        canvassed for in this community, etc., set this down (if
        true) as an evidence that there is an <i>interest</i> in
        books there. All the better chance for the agent with the
        best and most useful book. Frequent buyers are the most
        intelligent buyers.</p>
