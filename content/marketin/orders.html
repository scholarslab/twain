    <h2>Identifying the Audience</h2>
  </center>

        <p>MT felt that as a subscription author he reached a less
        sophisticated, more democratic audience than he would have
        if he had published his books in the trade and sold them
        through bookstores. On the other hand, the price of a
        subscription book, at least two or three times higher than
        trade novels, and thirty or forty times higher than a dime
        novel or a pirated newsprint edition of a foreign novel,
        suggests that his audience was still bourgeois. And agents
        were instructed to begin their canvass with the elite
        leaders of the communities they were working -- doctors,
        judges, ministers, and so on.</p>

        <p>There is still a lot to learn about who actually read MT
        in his times -- whether, for example, a "boys' book" like
        <i>Tom Sawyer</i> was in fact mainly read by boys. (Because
        of its price, it certainly wasn't <i>bought</i> by boys.)
        And there is some reason to think that subscription books
        may have had a larger percentage of male readers than
        non-subscription books. But one unique aspect of the
        subscription system is that each buyer of a text was
        identified by name and address. One could, presumably, get
        the names from a number of sales prospectuses for a
        particular MT book, identify the territory each agent
        worked, and through census and city records build up a
        demographic account of the kind of people who bought that
        book. In the meantime, if you're willing to decipher the
        agents' handwriting, you can get some idea of how much
        there is to learn from the sampling of orders here.</p>

        <p>The sales prospectus in the Barrett Collection with the
        most names in it is one for <i>The Gilded Age</i> (1873).
        This belonged to an agent whose territory included St.
        Paul, Minnesota. He or she sold 140 copies of the novel (as
        well as a couple orders for the previously-published
        <i>Innocents Abroad</i> and <i>Roughing It</i>). Most
        customers (111) chose the cheapest Cloth binding ($3.50).
        27 chose Leather for $4.50. And Half-Turkey ($5.00) and
        Full Turkey ($8.00) had one buyer each. Only two of the 140
        names are identified as "Mrs." Accessible here are four of
        the pages, containing about 80 names and addresses:</p>

<p>Most prospectuses in Barrett have only a few
        names in them, but it seems as if all of the people in Middletown, New York, who bought <i>Life 
on the Mississippi</i> from the agent whose prospectus we have are listed; he sold fifty copies altogether. The two pages of orders for <i>Huck Finn</i>
        are from different prospectuses, and were taken by two
        different agents; the first seems to have been working Elmira, New York, where MT wrote much of the novel, and the second was canvassing south of Boston, in Hanover and North Pembroke, Massachusetts. The orders for <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>
        were all taken by the same agent, who was canvassing the
        towns of Clinton and Waterville, New York.</p>
