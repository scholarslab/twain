        <p>We are sorry to see an increasing tendency on the part
        of some of our best writers to appeal to the public through
        the agency of publishers of subscription books, so called.
        The recent example of Mr. Warner [<b>MT's co-author of</b>
        <i>The Gilded Age</i>] has had a bad effect upon his
        contemporaries, and scores of the latter are saying to
        themselves, "Why shall not I, too, have my books published
        by a subscription house, and thereby get great gain?"</p>

        <p>Authors as a class are not satisfied with the pecuniary
        reward given them by publishers, which is generally ten per
        cent on the retail price of the book. They think, and not
        unreasonably, that four hundred and fifty dollars -- which
        would represent the author's share of the profits on a
        one-dollar-and-fifty book which reached a sale of 3,000
        copies -- is not a sufficient payment for the labor of six
        months, or, it may be, a year. Few of them -- Gail Hamilton
        and perhaps one or two others must be excepted -- complain
        that publishers receive more than a fair share of the
        profits; but they do think that those profits ought to be
        larger. The subscription plan offers certain important
        advantages, the chief of which is in the fact that a book
        is pushed into currency by the combined personal efforts of
        many experienced and dauntless men, while a book published
        in the regular way must depend mainly upon its own merits
        for its success. A subscription publisher, having agreed to
        publish a certain book, that would be sold by the regular
        trade at one dollar and a half, makes it up in such a way
        -- with thick paper, large type, and cheap illustrations --
        that it will bear the price of three dollars. Through the
        efforts of his agents, he sells from four to twenty times
        as many copies as the regular dealer would sell; and of
        course he can afford to allow the author a larger royalty.
        It would seem, in view of these facts, that the
        subscription plan was the only true way of publishing
        books. But several considerations are to be taken into
        account. Subscription books are in bad odor, and cannot
        possibly circulate among the best classes of readers, owing
        to the general and not unfounded prejudice against them as
        a class.</p>

        <p>Consequently, an author of established reputation, who
        resorts to the subscription plan for the sake of making
        more money, descends to a constituency of a lower grade and
        inevitably loses caste, just as Edwin Booth would lose
        caste, if, induced by the promise of greater pecuniary
        gain, he should "play to" the pit, instead of the parquet.
        For this loss no money could compensate.</p>

        <p>But the injury resulting from the adoption of the
        subscription plan by our best writers would not be limited
        to themselves, but would affect seriously our whole
        literature. This plan operates directly against the
        principle that the sale of a book should be proportioned to
        its merits, and makes these quite subordinate to the arts
        of importunity and trickery, which Mr. Perkins has so well
        described in "Scrope," and of which almost every reader has
        had personal experience, as characteristic of the
        book-canvasser.</p>
