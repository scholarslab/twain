    <h2>Adventures of a Woman Book Agent</h2>
  </center>

  <p><font size="+1"><i>Facts</i>, By a Woman</font> is the
  promising title of an anonymously published account of being a
  subscription book agent in California in the 1870s. At heart the
  book is a defense of this woman's decision to make her living by
  selling something door-to-door. It begins with the comment, made
  by a woman to other women, "I cannot, for the life of me, see how
  any woman that has the least sort of respect for herself can
  engage in such an occuptation. Why the very idea is enough to
  repel a pure-minded person." The author makes it clear that she
  was driven to the work by the lack of any other way to support
  herself. Immediately before deciding to become an agent for
  <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, she been trying with little
  success to sell something called "plaiting machines"
  door-to-door. Apparently that was less morally suspect, because,
  as she indicates in the book, the customers for such machines
  were exclusively women, whereas selling books brought her
  regularly into contact with men customers. Although the section
  about <i>Tom</i> ends by indicating that some male customers
  bought this "boys' book" from her for ulterior, adult reasons,
  she ends <i>Facts</i> with a declaration of her profession's
  respectability:</p>

  <p>"I solicited from basements to garrets, and sold books in
  both, to rich and poor men, roughs and gentlemen; and think I
  have climbed steps enough to land me in heavenland, and am just
  as far away from the goodly place, but not any farther, than when
  I first began my sad departure; for I received many good lessons,
  and some of the very best, from the roughest masters, and when
  least expected. And although temptations and insults greeted me,
  I would also have received them if stationed behind any village
  or city store counter, in any permanent establishment. And I saw
  no reason why I should not or could not work in that capacity as
  well as men, and support myself, and respectably, too. And when
  any straggling man-shaped animal presumed upon my acquaintance,
  wanting to see me at home whether or not, I rejected with the
  same plea, though inwardly, as given by a wary father of a
  teasing Mills' Seminary daughter who wanted to accompany him on a
  pleasure trip to Oregon, when he replied: 'Lord, Alice, I can
  catch the itch there without taking it with me.'"</p>

  <p>What can be accessed below is a substantial excerpt from her
  experiences with <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, the first book she took
  orders for. Her account provides good firsthand evidence of what
  kinds of things counted with MT's subscription readers, and of
  the reception MT's first novel received in this small mining town
  in California.</p>
