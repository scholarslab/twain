        should be doubly blessed for saving the center table from
        utter dullness. Do you remember that center table of the
        seventies? The marbled top showed glossy in the subdued
        light that filtered through the lace curtains, and it was
        clammy cold even on hot days. The heavy mahogany legs were
        chiseled into writhing curves from which depended stern
        geometrical designs or possibly bunches of grapes. The
        Bible had the place of honor and was flanked by
        subscription books. In those days the house never became
        cluttered with the ephemeral six best sellers. The new
        books came a year apart, and each was meant for the center
        table, and it had to be so thick and heavy and emblazoned
        with gold that it could keep company with the bulky and
        high-priced Bible.</p>

        <p>Books were bought by the pound. Sometimes the agent was
        a ministerial person in black clothes and a stove-pipe hat.
        Maiden ladies and widows, who supplemented their specious
        arguments with private tales of woe, moved from one small
        town to another feeding upon prominent citizens.
        Occasionally the prospectus was unfurled by an
        undergraduate of a freshwater college working for the money
        to carry him another year.</p>

        <p>The book agents varied, but the book was always the
        same, -- many pages, numerous steel engravings, curly-cue
        tail-pieces, platitudes, patriotism, poetry, sentimental
        mush. One of the most popular, still resting in many a dim
        sanctuary, was known as "Mother, Home, and Heaven." A
        ponderous collection of "Poetical Gems" did not involve the
        publishers in any royalty entanglements. Even "The Lives of
        the Presidents" and "Noble Deeds of the Great and Brave"
        gave every evidence of having been turned out as piece-work
        by needy persons temporarily lacking employment on
        newspapers. Let us not forget the "Manual of Deportment and
        Social Usages," from which the wife of an agriculturalist
        could learn the meaning of R.S.V.P. and the form to be
        employed in acknowledging an invitation to a levee.</p>

        <p>Nobody really wanted these books. They were purchased
        because the agents knew how to sell them, and they seemed
        large for the price, and, besides, every well-furnished
        home had to keep something on the center table.</p>

        <p>Subscription books were dry picking for boys. Also they
        were accessible only on the Sabbath after the weekly
        scouring. On week-days the boys favored an underground
        circulating library, named after Mr. Beadle, and the
        hay-mow was the chosen reading room. Let one glorious
        exception be made in the case of "Dr. Livingstone's Travels
        in Africa," a subscription book of forbidding size, but
        containing many pictures of darkies with rings in their
        noses.</p>

        <p>Just when front-room literature seemed at its lowest
        ebb, so far as the American boy was concerned, along came
        Mark Twain. His books looked, at a distance, just like the
        other distended, diluted, and altogether tasteless volumes
        that had been used for several decades to balance the ends
        of the center table. The publisher knew his public, so he
        gave a pound of book for every fifty cents, and crowded in
        plenty of wood-cuts and stamped the outside with golden
        bouquets and put in a steel engraving of the author, with a
        tissue paper veil over it, and "sicked" his multitude of
        broken-down clergymen, maiden ladies, grass widows, and
        college students on to the great American public.</p>

        <p>Can you see the boy, a Sunday morning prisoner, approach
        the book with a dull sense of foreboding, expecting a dose
        of Tupper's "Proverbial Philosophy"? Can you see him a few
        minutes later when he finds himself linked arm-in-arm with
        Mulberry Sellers or Buck Fanshaw or the convulsing idiot
        who wanted to know if Christopher Columbus was sure-enough
        dead? No wonder he curled up on the hair-cloth sofa and
        hugged the thing to his bosom and lost all interest in
        Sunday-school. "Innocents Abroad" was the most enthralling
        book ever printed until "Roughing It" appeared. Then along
        came "The Gilded Age," "Life on the Mississippi," and "Tom
        Sawyer," one cap sheaf after another. While waiting for a
        new one we read the old ones all over again.</p>

        <p>The new uniform edition with the polite little pages,
        high-art bindings, and all the boisterous wood-cuts
        carefully expurgated can never take the place of those
        lumbering subscription books. They were the early friends
        and helped us to get acquainted with the most amazing
        story-teller that ever captivated the country boys and
        small-town boys all over America.</p>

        <p>While we are honoring Mark Twain as a great literary
        artist, a philosopher, and a teacher, let the boys of the
        seventies add their tribute. They knew him for his miracle
        of making the subscription book something to be read and
        not merely looked at. He converted the Front Room from a
        Mausoleum into a Temple of Mirth.</p>
