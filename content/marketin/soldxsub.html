        <p>It's likely that when MT was first contacted by Elisha
        Bliss about publishing a book, he didn't know what "sold
        only by subscription" meant. But the success of
        <i>Innocents Abroad</i> soon made him an enthusiastic
        advocate of the system. "Anything but subscription
        publication," he once wrote Howells, "is printing for
        private circulation."</p>

        <p>"Sold only by subscription" meant that during most of
        MT's lifetime his contemporaries didn't buy his new book in
        a bookstore, but rather from a sales agent who called at
        their home or workplace with <a href="prospect.html">a
        bound prospectus</a> and <a href="spiel.html">a prepared
        spiel</a>. There were tens of thousands of these agents
        going door-to-door through the villages, towns and cities
        of America during the heyday of the system, which coincided
        with the first twenty-five years of MT's career.
        Commentators on subscription publishing often assume that
        the average agent was a Civil War veteran, but 
<a href="javascript:Start2('tsnotice.html')">the few references to specific
        agents</a> I've seen suggest that many of them were women
        (see also <a href="facts2.html">Adventures of a Woman Book
        Agent</a>).</p>

        <p>Selling MT's books by subscription meant that they cost
        about three times as much as comparable trade books. You
        can see this vividly by comparing the price quoted in
        <a href="javascript:Start('tsaad.html')">the Webster &amp;
        Co. ad</a> for the subscription edition of <i>Life on the
        Mississippi</i> with the price in <a href=
        "javascript:Start('tsaad96.html')">an ad for the Harpers'
        trade edition</a> that came out just two years later.
        Subscription prices enabled MT to make a lot more money
        from his popular works, but when Bliss included <a href=
        "javascript:Start('topublic.html')">a defense of the cost
        of subscription books</a> on the back pages of <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i> he didn't mention profit.</p>

        <p>"Sold by subscription" meant that MT's books were
        aggressively marketed. Subscription publishers talked about
        canvassing agents the way Hank Morgan describes the knights
        he sends through Arthur's kingdom, as "missionaries of
        civilization," bringing to small towns and remote districts
        the light of the word -- that is, of a great many words,
        for subscription books needed to be long to help justify
        <a name="a" id="a">their price</a>. Most trade publishers,
        and many other writers, <a href="crocker.html">attacked the
        system</a> as a mercenary debasement of literature into
        mere business. According to Nathaniel Hawthorne's son
        Julian, agents were "trained to talk a man into a state of
        imbecility, and then, under guise of giving him something
        he does not want, to rob him of his money."</p>

        <p>To MT this sales method largely defined his audience:
        "When a subscription book of mine sells 60,000," he wrote
        Henry Rogers, "I always think I know whither 50,000 of them
        went. They went to people who don't visit bookstores" (see
        also <a href="orders.html">Identifying MT's Audience</a>).
        It also <a name="b" id="b">had a</a> great deal to do with
        shaping his art. His genius enabled him in many ways to
        <a href="geoade.html">transcend the terms of the
        system</a>: his <i>Gilded Age</i>, for example, was the
        first subscription novel. But in other ways his imagination
        remained captive to the circumstances of selling books
        door-to-door. "A well-made novel," "an original work of
        art" -- these weren't slogans agents could use to convince
        a potential customer to pay $4.50 for a book when the
        average daily wage was less than $2.00. "Nearly 700 pages .
        . . and a laugh on every page" (as agents were instructed
        to promise buyers of <i>Following the Equator</i>) -- that
        was the kind of thing MT and his publishers assumed the
        reader who bought a book "by subscription" was looking
        for.</p>

        <p><a name="c" id="c">As MT's career went</a> on, he found additional ways to sell
        his books. When he started up his own firm, he never
        hesitated about making it a subscription company. Its first
        marketable commodity was <i>Huck Finn</i>, and in marketing
        it MT had Webster follow the techniques of Bliss's company.
        But he also hoped to secure at least 40,000 subscribers by
        December, 1884, so that he could publish by December 15,
        and then "dump" thousands of additional copies into
        bookstores in time to catch the holiday trade.  When someone 
	<a href="../huckfinn/hucprohp.html">defaced <i>Huck</i>'s prospectus</a>, 
	publication had to be postponed until the start of 1885, but by the summer  
	of that year you could <a href="tradehuck.html">buy the novel in stores</a>.  

By the
        1890's, the subscription system was on its way out.
        Harpers, an established trade publisher, took over the
        sales of his earlier books. Yet much of MT's success as a
        writer, and many of his weaknesses, were equally the
        product of that system.</p>
