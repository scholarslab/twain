  <p>Although MT did very little revising of his work once a text
  was published, his various publishers kept reissuing his books in
  new editions. These representative catalogues -- from the
  beginning, middle and end of his career -- help us appreciate the
  way his books were presented as both imaginative achievements and
  material commodities.</p>

<td>  <p>The American Publishing Company, as run by
  Elisha Bliss, published MT's books until 1880.
  With the success of <i>Innocents Abroad</i>
  he immediately became their most valuable asset,
  but Bliss published a number of other subscription books --
  too many, MT felt. This four-page list of those titles
  was included inside the prospectus of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
  (1876).</p>

<td><p>By 1880 MT thought he had had enough of Bliss,
  who turned out to be as good at misleading his authors
  as he was at misleading the public. The established
  Boston firm of Osgood &amp; Company brought out two
  MT books -- <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i> and <i>Life
  on the Mississippi</i> -- but by 1884 MT had founded his  own
  publishing house: Webster &amp; Co. Its first book was <i>Huck
  Finn</i>. By 1892, when this illustrated catalogue came out,
  its book list was a long and growing one.</p></td>

<td><p>Webster &amp; Co. crashed in the Panic of 1893. For
  <i>Pudd'n-head Wilson</i> and other books of the 1890s MT was
  forced back to the American Publishing Company, now
  headed by Frank Bliss, Elisha's son. But as part of the
  reorganization of MT's property after his bankruptcy
  Harpers
  acquired his earlier copyrights, and by the middle of
  the decade were bringing out collected editions of his
  work.
  This beautifully illustrated catalogue from 1912 advertises
  the 25-volume National Edition of MT's work.</p></td>

<td><p>During the last 15 years of MT's life Harper's published
  his works in several different sets and combinations, as you
  can see from this collection of five ads from the back pages of
<i>Harper's Weekly Magazine</i>, 1896 - 1910.</p>
