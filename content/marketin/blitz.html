    <p>As part of his "Fellow Savages of the Sandwich Islands"
    lecture tour, MT was booked into Collingwood's Opera House in
    Poughkeepsie, New York, on 3 December 1869. Apparently by a
    lucky coincidence, in late November the <i>Daily Eagle</i>
    began running an ad for a local agent to sell <i>Innocents
    Abroad</i> in the region. According to the ad, the opportunity
    was literally golden:</p>

    <p>In the days before the night of the lecture, the paper
    "puffed" the coming appearance and a paid advertisement
    announced that the new local agent "is now canvassing this
    city." On 2 December, readers of the <i>Eagle</i> could read
    about both the book and the performance on facing pages:</p>

    </center>

    <p>Whether the local agent ever collected that $100 in gold is
    unknown, but the publicity surrounding "Mark's first appearance
    in our city" surely helped her or his canvass. We can only
    imagine what MT would be able to do with his books, his flair
    for self-promotion, his prowess as a live performer and today's
    varied media outlets.</p>
