          <h2>A Book Agent at the Door</h2>
        </center>

        <p>The intention of this part of the archive is to
        simulate, however imperfectly, the experience of buying one
        of MT's books from a subscription agent.</p>

        <p>We can do this because, along with a prospectus, agents
        were sent a script for presenting and selling it. In the
        Barrett Collection is one example of this kind of text --
        titled "Canvass of Mark Twain," it tells the subscription
        agent exactly how she or he should convince someone to buy
        <i>Following the Equator</i>.</p>

        <p>Undoubtedly no agent ever followed this scenario
        verbatim, but since most knew nothing about the book they
        were selling beyond the prospectus they probably relied
        heavily on its advice about how to manipulate the buyer's
        appetites, which aspects of the book to emphasize, what to
        say about MT.</p>

        <p>As you'll see, the "Canvass of Mark Twain" takes an
        agent step-by-step, selling point by selling point, from
        beginning a sale to picking a binding. Clicking below will
        take you to the agent's opening lines, and from there
        you'll be able to click your way through the whole spiel,
        at least as the American Publishing Company imagined it
        should go. (You can <i>hear</i> the pitch by clicking on
        the <img src="../onstage/sndicon.gif" border="0" alt=
        "HEAR SPIEL" /> icon you'll see on every page; the part of
        the book agent is played by Meagan Hess.) Of course,
        whether you want to buy <i>Following the Equator</i> is up
        to you. You can <font size="-1"><b>END SALE</b></font> and
        return to this page at any time.</p>
