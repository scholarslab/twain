  <p>MT conceived this <b>MEMORY-BUILDER</b> game while finishing
  the manuscript of <i>Huck Finn</i>.  Huck, of course, doesn't take no stock in dead people, but
MT was always an avid student of history.  He originally conceived the game as a way to help his
  daughters learn historical dates, but it quickly grew in his mind into a
  marketable commodity that, he hoped, would sweep the country.
  Below is the game board, with the front side on the left. It also
  came with a small pamphlet of historical facts, mainly the reigns
  of European monarchs but American Presidents do make the last
  page, and a packet of straight pins, half of them cheaply painted
  black. One played the game by pushing the pins directly into the
  board -- and perhaps in version 2.0 of this site you'll be able
  to play it here. (If you want to play a game loosely based on
  MT's, but focusing on "Mark Twain and His Times," <a href=
  "../timeline/index.html">you can do that right now</a>.)</p>

<p>MT's emphases in his "<font size="-1">REMARKS</font>" on playing the game are perhaps surprising.  "The most conspicuous landmarks in history," he writes, "are the accessions of kings."  For knowing that "James I ascended the English throne" in 1603, for example, a player gets 10 points; "Declaration of Independence, 1776," by comparison is a "minor event," worth 1 point.  I haven't been able to find out if MT made much
  money from this invention.</p>
