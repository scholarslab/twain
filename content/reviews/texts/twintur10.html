 -- The unique entertainment given by Mark Twain and George W.
Cable at Music Hall last evening was attended by an audience which
filled nearly every seat on the floor and in the galleries. Mr.
Cable has taken his place among the best American novelists and has
created a unique and striking original style of story. There was
much curiosity, therefore, to see the author of the Creole tales
which have won such remarkable popularity with the reading public
of late years. Mr. Cable is not a handsome man, but his face and
head show an active intellect and a vivid imagination. His
recitations, which were all taken from his strongest work, "Dr.
Sevier," were delivered in a striking and pleasing though not
artistic manner. His singing of Creole songs was warmly applauded.
Mark Twain, though laboring under a severe cold, managed to make
himself heard by the large audience, which showed a disposition to
laugh whether he spoke or was silent. There was nothing remarkably
witty in his remarks, but his manner and the humorous expression of
his mouth and eyes would create laughter if he should read an act
of congress to an audience. Altogether, the entertainment was
pleasing, not only from its novelty, but from the originality of
the men who conducted it. It did not drag, and the audience as it
retired at 10:45 o'clock was by no means weary of listening to the
pathos and humor of Cable and the laughable remarks of Mark Twain.
A literary entertainment is a success if the auditors remain in
their places to the end. Few, if any, left the hall last evening
till they were startled from their seats by the sudden ending of
Mark Twain's ghost story.
