<h2>London<i>Daily Telegraph</i> [unsigned]<br>
 1890: January 13</h2>

<br>
 At this holiday season, in books and newspapers, on stage and in
drawing-room, the poet and the painter, the author, the actor, and
the dramatist compete with one another to bring before young and
old scenes and suggestions of beauty, heroism, purity, and truth.
One writer is an exception. M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font
size="-1">WAIN</font> sets himself to show the seamy side of the
legendary Round Table of King A<font size="-1">RTHUR'S</font> time.
He depicts all the vices of feudalism -- the licentiousness of the
nobles, their arrogance and insolence to the middle classes, their
neglect of the poor, their hours of gluttony and idleness, varied
by raids and brawls and riotous disorders. He describes how a
Yankee visiting the Court uses modern inventions, defeats the best
warriors, and redresses the wrongs of the poor. It is quite
possible that a serious purpose underlies what otherwise seems a
vulgar travesty. We have every regard for M<font size=
"-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> -- a writer who has
enriched English literature by admirable descriptions of boy life,
and who in <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i> has given a vivid
picture of medi&aelig;val times. A book, however, that tries to
deface our moral and literary currency by bruising and soiling the
image of King A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font>, as left to us by
legend and consecrated by poetry, is a very unworthy production of
the great humourist's pen. No doubt there is one element of wit --
incongruity -- in bringing a Yankee from Connecticut face to face
with feudal knights; but sharp contrast between vulgar facts and
antique ideas is not the only thing necessary for humour. If it
were, then a travelling Cockney putting a flaming tie round the
neck of the "Apollo Belvidere," or sticking a clay pipe between the
lips of the "Venus de Medici," would be a matter-of-fact M<font
size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font>, and as much
entitled to respect. Burlesque and travesty are satire brought down
to the meanest capacity, and they have their proper province when
pretentious falsehoods put on the masks of solemnity and truth.
Stilted tragedies, artificial melodramas, unnatural acting, are
properly held up to ridicule on the stage or in parodies. The
mannerisms of a popular writer like C<font size="-1">ARLYLE</font>,
B<font size="-1">ROWNING</font>, or even T<font size=
"-1">ENNYSON</font>, may, through caricature, be good-humouredly
exposed; but an attack on the ideals associated with King A<font
size="-1">RTHUR</font> is a coarse pandering to that passion for
irreverence which is at the basis of a great deal of Yankee wit. To
make a jest of facts, phrases, or words -- Scriptural, heroic, or
legendary -- that are held in awe or reverence by other men is the
open purpose of every witling on a Western print, who endeavours to
follow in the footsteps of A<font size="-1">RTEMUS</font> W<font
size="-1">ARD</font>, B<font size="-1">RET</font> H<font size=
"-1">ARTE</font>, and M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
"-1">WAIN</font>. They may finally be successful enough to destroy
their own trade. They now live by shocking decent people who still
retain love for the Bible, H<font size="-1">OMER</font>, S<font
size="-1">HAKESPEARE</font>, S<font size="-1">COTT</font>, and
T<font size="-1">ENNYSON</font>; but when they have thoroughly
trained a rising generation to respect nothing their irreverence
will fall flat. 

<p>The stories of King A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font> that have come
down to us represent in legendary form not any historical fact, but
an ideal of kingship and knighthood which had birth in the hearts
and aspirations of medi&aelig;val men. This was their ideal of what
a King amongst his warriors ought to be, and the beautiful image
has fired the thoughts and purified the imagination of millions of
men and women for many generations. Will this shrine in human souls
be destroyed because a Yankee scribe chooses to fling pellets of
mud upon the high altar? The instincts of the past and the genius
of T<font size="-1">ENNYSON</font> have consecrated for ever "the
goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world holds
record." The Round Table is dissolved, but we can still "delight
our souls with talk of knightly deeds," as they at Camelot in the
storied past. We can still apply the image of the ideal knight as a
criterion of modern worth. King A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font> swore
each of his followers to "reverence his conscience as his King, To
ride abroad redressing human wrongs, To speak no slander, no, nor
listen to it, To honour his own word as if his G<font size=
"-1">OD'S</font>, To lead sweet lives in purest chastity. To love
one maiden only, cleave to her, And worship her by years of noble
deeds." Such an oath presented to a modern Yankee would seem to
convey in almost every phrase a covert insult to American
institutions. In a land where commercial fraud and industrial
adulteration are fine arts we had better omit appeals to
"conscience." The United States are not likely to "ride abroad
redressing human wrong" -- as they never gave a dollar or a man to
help Greece, Poland, Hungary, or Italy in their struggles to be
free. "To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it," would utterly
uproot America's free press -- based to a great extent on
scandalous personalities. Loving one maiden only and cleaving to
her must seem too "high-toned" in the States, where there are many
facilities for ready divorce. So far M<font size="-1">ARK</font>
T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> is right as a Western iconoclast to
pelt with sarcasm ideals which are not included in the Constitution
or customs of the United States. Yet, in spite of all that America
has done or can do to deface images of self-sacrifice and beauty,
there are chosen souls in her own borders who have fulfilled the
heroic ideals of the olden time. The Abolitionists of New England
encountered great perils when they first set out to redress the
great human wrong of negro slavery, and they fought as noble a
contest against organised iniquity as any knight of A<font size=
"-1">RTHUR'S</font> Court. They faced political obloquy, mob
violence, loss of limb, sometimes of life, and the falling away of
friends and relatives, because they had inherited the old instinct
of knights, to lead lives of duty to their fellow-men. They were
jeered and derided by the M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size= 
"-1">WAINS</font> of the day, but their foresight was proved at the
end of the war, when the world recognised the two-fold result, "a
nation saved, a race delivered." What, too, would have been the
fate of the Republic if no ideal image of their country shone
before the souls of the men who died to save the Union? Coward
souls at the North said, "It will cost much money and many lives to
re-conquer the South: let them go; let the Republic break up; what
is a country to us?" but a chivalry that came down from British
ancestors animated the men who followed G<font size=
"-1">RANT</font>, and they kept to their high purpose until the
field was won. Where was M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
"-1">WAIN</font> then? Why did he not satirise the patriotism that
would not let a Republic be mutilated? Why did he not sneer at
Yankee reverence for a paper Constitution not a hundred years old?
Why did he not sing the glories of trade as better than any
preservation of the Union or liberation of negro slaves?</p>

<p>Even if we look at the real feudalism idealised in the legends
of King A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font>, it was not all evil. No
doubt there were licentious nobles at all times, and there were
great landlords who were occasionally cruel to the peasants in
their fields. The change to modern times, however, is not all a
gain. A great lord of old held his possessions by "suit and
service"; he was bound to follow his King to the wars. Now he owns
his broad lands free of duty, and may live a life of shameful
luxury when he likes. The peasant of the olden times was not always
in distress. The country was thinly peopled; he had as much land as
he wanted; the woods were full of wild game, the streams of fish;
except on occasions of rare famine he was fed well. Such a thing as
an eviction was unknown, and for one good reason -- the lord was
not only bound to serve the King, but to bring men for his army;
consequently he had an interest in raising on his estates a body of
faithful followers. The modern landlord drives his peasants into
the towns, where, uncared for by him, they degenerate and die in
slums. We must remember, too, that the vices of the past were
characteristic of rough times; they were the sins of brutality, not
of fraud. A bad knight of the feudal age wronged a maid or widow,
and refused redress; but what are the offences of a commercial age?
In America and in England, to a lesser extent, financial swindling
is elaborately organised. The wicked man of modern times does not
couch his lance against the weak or lowly; he sends out a
prospectus. In twelve months the widow and orphan are breadless;
the promoter and the financier have added another twenty thousand
to their stores. Were King A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font> to descend
in New York to-morrow he would make for Wall-street, where he would
find a host of men whose word is as good, and as bad, as their bond
-- railway schemers who plunder the shareholders of a continent,
and are ever intent by every device of falsehood and of plot to
deceive each other and to defraud the public. Talk of the
inequality of man! King A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font> and the
meanest menial in his halls were nearer to each other in conditions
of life than the cramp in the slums of New York and the A<font
size="-1">STORS</font>, V<font size="-1">ANDERBILTS</font>, and
J<font size="-1">AY</font> G<font size="-1">OULDS</font> who have
piled up millions extracted from the pockets of less successful
men. The Republic is a 'land of liberty,' yet its commerce, its
railways, and is manufactures are in the hands of a few cliques of
almost irresponsible capitalists, who control tariffs, markets, and
politics in order that they may be enriched, to the disadvantage of
the masses. Which, then, is to be most admired -- the supremacy of
a knight or the success of a financier? Under which King will the
Americans serve -- the ideal or the real? Will they own allegiance
to King A<font size="-1">RTHUR</font> or J<font size="-1">AY</font>
G<font size="-1">OULD</font>?</p>
