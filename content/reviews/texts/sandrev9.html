<p>Mark Twain is, to our taste, and in our judgment, the best
humorist now before the public. His humor is in the idea, and not
in the mere use or misuse of words and phrases, which unfortunately
seem to constitute the sole resort of most of the so-called
humorists of the day. In genuine fun, both in the idea and in the
setting, Mark Twain is immeasurably in advance of "Nasby," "Josh
Billings" and the whole miscellaneous tribe of bad spellers and
verbal contortionists who assume to play a funny part among the
ephemera of literature. The very "Petroleum" of Nasby is affected,
and his peculiarities give zest rather to partisan politics than to
the multitude. "Josh Billings" has a deal of humor but both he and
Nasby shroud themselves in a mystery of infamous orthography, which
becomes tiresome and even painful in a short time, and makes us
turn with unmindful satisfaction to the natural and occasionally
most singular humor of Twain. . . . "Artemus Ward" in his well
known lecture on "Babes in the Woods," made a point of constantly
avoiding his subject. "Mark Twain" does nothing of the kind. His
lecture with the fun out, would make a telling and accurate sketch
of the Sandwich Islands and the natives thereof; but with the fun
in, it is a lecture that both amuses and instructs.</p>
