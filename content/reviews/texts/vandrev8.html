<p><i>MT spoke in Iowa City on Friday, 15 January 1869. His visit
was not a success. In its weekly edition for January 13, the</i>
Iowa City Republican <i>advertised the lecture as a very promising
event:</i></p>

<p>T<font size="-1">HE</font> F<font size="-1">IRST</font> L<font
size="-1">ECTURE</font>. -- The first lecture of the Course will be
delivered on Friday evening of this week, at Metropolitan Hall, by
that celebrated humorist, Mark Twain. Subject: "The American Vandal
Abroad." We have never heard this lecturer, but judging from his
reputation we shall anticipate a rich and rare discourse. The
Association has selected him because he has succeeded in making
such a reputation, judging rightfully, that he could not have made
it without merit. We hope to see an old fashioned crowd in
attendance on Friday evening. The net proceeds of the lecture will
be devoted entirely to good works in our city. The time, the
occasion, the man, and the cause demand an overflowing house.</p>

<p><i>In its next edition, a week later, the paper panned MT's
performance both on and off stage.</i></p>

<p>T<font size="-1">HE</font> V<font size="-1">ANDAL IN</font>
I<font size="-1">OWA</font> C<font size="-1">ITY</font>. -- A
splendid audience turned out to hear Mark Twain discourse about
"The Vandal Abroad," and we fear were generally disappointed. As a
lecture it was a humbug. As an occasion for laughter on very small
capital of wit or ideas it was a success. There were one or two
passages of some merit. His apostrophe to the Sphinx was decidedly
good, as was also his description of the ruins of the Parthenon,
and of Athens by moonlight. Some touches of Venice did very well,
but it was impossible to know when he was talking in earnest and
when in burlesque. It was amusing and interesting to see such a
crowd of people laughing together, even though we knew half of them
were ashamed that they were laughing at such very small witticisms.
We were very much disappointed that there was so little substance
to his lecture. We would not give two cents to hear him again.</p>

<p>But, lest he might not have succeeded with his "Vandal Abroad,"
he illustrated the character at the Clinton House, where he
stopped. The morning after the lecture nothing was seen of him up
to nine o'clock, and the landlord, in his kindness, went to his
room to see if he might not be in want of something, but received a
storm of curses and abuse for disturbing him. Of course the
landlord retreated and left him. After a while a terrible racket
was heard, and unearthly screams which frightened the women of the
house. The landlord rushed to the room and there found a splendid
specimen of the vandal and his works. There, before him, was the
veritable animal, with his skin on at least, but not much else, and
in a towering rage. He had kicked the fastenings from the door, not
deigning to open it in the usual way -- that would have been too
much like other folks. He poured upon the landlord another torrent
of curses, impudence and abuse. He demanded to know where the
bell-pull was. The landlord told him they were not up yet, and they
had not yet got the house fully completed. His kicking the door
open and his lung performance were his substitute for a bell. At
two o'clock P.M. he had not dressed, and whether he did before he
left on the five o'clock train we did not learn. The Y.M.C.A. were
wretchedly imposed upon by Mark Twain, and so of course were the
audience. He is the only one engaged for the course whose personal
character was unknown. In great contrast will he be followed by the
glorious Howard, the Christian Hero and Soldier, who gave his own
right arm to his country, and who was ever true to her cause and
the cause of his great Master above.</p>
