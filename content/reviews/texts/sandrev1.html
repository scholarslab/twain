<h2>LOCAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
</center>

<hr width="30%">
<p>Mark Twain discoursed about the Sandwich Islands for an hour
last night at the Music Hall, and although at the early part of the
lecture there was evidently some disappointment, he soon was in
favor with his hearers, and the last two-thirds of the production
were richly enjoyed. Mr. Clemens is truly an original lecturer, his
manner being as unique as his matter. He spoke without notes,
walked about the stage most of the time, and was dry and droll,
serious and even pathetic. His matter was a series of surprises, it
being difficult for the listener to know what was earnest and what
was fun. His most ludicrous jokes were related with a serious air,
that imparted a fresh flavor to them. The entertainment, for such
indeed it was, was a very enjoyable one, so enjoyable and peculiar
that all attempts to describe it would fail. The hearty applause
given indicated that the audience were pleased.</p>

<h2>Mark Twain on "The Sandwich Islands."</h2>
</center>

Boston had a very novel, if not a very startling, sensation last
evening in the shape of a lecture from Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, who
is known to fame as the humorist Mark Twain. Known to fame, we say,
for who that breathes the vital air in America has not heard of the
jumping frog of Calaveras County, California? and who has not read
of the "new specimen" which Mark Twain made by combining a hawk and
a crow in "one neat job"? A company, even greater than that which
usually attends the Bureau lectures, assembled in the Music Hall
that night with faces primed for merriment, and punctually to the
hour Mr. Clemens and Mr. Redpath appeared upon the platform. This
was of course, and it was also of course that for fifteen minutes
afterwards the speaker's voice should be made inaudible by the
rustling and creaking and tramping of the regular crowd of the
tardy.

<p>Mark Twain is a very good looking man. He is of medium height
and moderately slender build, has light brown hair, a reddish brown
moustache, regular features and a fresh complexion; and he has a
queer way of wrinkling up his nose and half closing his eyes when
he speaks. The expression of his face is as calm and imperturbable
as that of the sphinx. Looking at him you feel it to be an
impossibility that he should ever hurry or ever be out of temper,
and you might suppose him to be incapable of a joke, if it were not
for the peculiar twinkle in his merry eyes. His voice is remarkably
light and remarkably dry--like some German wines--and it seems to
be modulated to only two keys. His style of speaking is unique to
the last degree. It is all of a piece with the quality of his
humor, and fits him like a glove. He delivers his sentences without
haste, and in a tone of utter indifference, marking the highest
waves of his thought only by a strong flavor of nasality, and
knowing for the most part only the rising inflection at the
beginning, middle and end of his sentences. The rising inflection
is not native here, nor is it born in the manner of any of our own
speakers. Mr. Dickens first taught us how it might be used to
advantage; and Mark Twain, doubtless without borrowing a leaf from
Mr. Dickens's note-book, has found out for himself how effective an
adjunct it is to humorous speech. In short, the platform manner of
Mr. Clemens is the exact reflection in speech of his peculiar style
of composition. The fun of both is genuine enough; but the
perception of the fun is unmeasurably heightened by the apparently
serious intention of the general discourse, and at times by an air
of half seriousness in the joke itself. The audience gets into a
queer state after a while. It knows not what to trust; for while
much is meant to be seriously taken, the fun is felt to be the real
life of the thing; and yet they never know where the fun will come
in. Even when Mr. Clemens has made a really fine period, or
introduced a brilliant descriptive passage, he takes pains to turn
the affair into a joke at the end. As, for instance, after a very
graphic and well written description of the great volcanic eruption
in the Sandwich Islands, delivered with perfect indifference and
almost as if with an effort--he paused for just an instant, and
then said in the same passionless tone--"There! I'm glad I've got
that volcano off my mind." The manner is a direct resultant of the
matter; and the manner of his speech does a great deal for the
substance of his discourse. The story of "Our Fellow-Savages in the
Sandwich Islands" would not be nearly so funny to read as it is to
hear from Mark Twain's lips;--though we do not mean to deny that
there is a great deal of genuine and irresistible humor in the
texture of the discourse. Indeed, we mean to say, distinctly, that
the contrary was the fact, and that Mr. Clemens showed himself last
night in the character of a very quaint, peculiar, and eminently
original humorist. America has produced, at least, a quintette of
genuine humorists, whose productions have many of the <i>
indicia</i> of genius, if they are not wholly inspired by it.</p>

<p>We are obliged to say again, as we said in the cases of Nasby
and Josh Billings, that there is little use in trying to write a
sketch of the discourse. But we must attempt to give our readers a
little taste of the speaker's quality. Mr. Clemens devoted the
first ten minutes of his lecture to a painfully accurate
description of a person afflicted with the most loathsome form of
Oriental leprosy; and then he gave five minutes to the narration of
a boyish adventure which ended in his seeing the horrible face of a
dead man in the moonlight. And all this mass of horror for what?
Simply that he might say that his memory was full of unpleasant
things so linked together that when he thought of one he inevitably
thought of another, and so on through the entire series; and
starting with leprosy and dead faces in the moonlight his mind
necessarily ran through other unpleasant things until it brought
him to the Sandwich Islands and his lecture. The position of the
islands he gave geographically; but why they were placed so far
away from everything and in such an inconvenient space, he declined
to consider. The man who would have discovered the islands but did
not, he said, was diverted from his course by a manuscript found in
a bottle; and this, said Mark Twain, is not the only case in which
a man has been turned from the true path by suggestions drawn from
a bottle. The European nations brought into the islands their own
diseases, together with civilization, education and other
calamities. The effect of this had been to diminish the native
population;--education in particular causing a frightful mortality
as the facilities for learning were multiplied. But fifty thousand
natives are now left upon the islands, and it is proposed to start
a few more seminaries to finish them. The country people of the
islands, the women, he said, wear a single garment made of one
piece; "and the men don't." But when the weather is inclement the
men wear cotton in their ears. The hospitality of the people he
declared to be of a very high and generous order. A stranger might
enter any house and straightway his host would set before him raw
fresh fish with the scales on, baked dogs, fricasseed cats, and all
the luxuries of the season. But in trade they were exceedingly
sharp and deceitful,--lying invariably from one end of the
transaction to the other; not descending to common lies either, but
indulging in lies that are "gorgeously imposing and that awe you by
their grandeur." The fondness of the islanders for dogs he declared
to be intense. Dogs had the best of everything and were the close
companions of the men. "They fondle and caress the dog until he is
a full grown dog, and then they eat him." "I couldn't do that,"
said Mr. Clemens, in one of his dryest and funniest passages; "I'd
rather go hungry two days than eat an old personal friend in that
way."</p>

<p>At one point in his lecture, namely, in the midst of a
discussion of cannibalism, Mark Twain paused and said with an
indescribable look: "At this point I usually illustrate cannibalism
before the audience: but I am a stranger here, and feel diffident
about asking favors." However, he said, if there is any one present
who is willing to contribute a baby for the purposes of the
lecture, I should be glad to know it now. I am aware, though, that
children have become scarce and high of late, having been thinned
out by neglect and ill treatment since the woman movement
began.</p>

<p>But we must leave the rest to the imagination of our readers,
only saying that Mr. Clemens told two of the funniest of
exaggerated stories in the most irresistible fashion, and concluded
his lecture with a few graceful words of thanks to the audience for
their attention. Perhaps he is not a great humorist, but he is a
genuine humorist. The man who can say that the Islanders' dish of
plain dog "is only our cherished American sausage with the mystery
removed" is one whose reputation fame will not suffer to die; and
if Mr. Clemens can please everywhere as he pleased in Boston last
night, he will be sure to make his fortune if he does not become a
standard author.</p>

<p><font size="-1">THE LECTURE SEASON.<br>
NASBY--MARK TWAIN--DE CORDOVA.</font></p>
</center>

<p>I was going to head this paragraph "The Humorist Lecturers," but
the only professed humorist among the three men I have named is
Mark Twain. De Cordova is not a humorist at all; and Nasby's humor
is subordinate to his radicalism and reformatory power. De Cordova
is a nice looking person and is well dressed. "He is put upon the
stage unexceptionably," as the theatrical critics say of a new
piece at Selwyn's. The screen, the foot-lights, the music stand on
which he places his manuscript, are all very nice, and you are
somewhat reminded of Dickens when you look at the whole
arrangement. And De Cordova is not unlike Dickens in his
gesticulation, being very active and sprightly and dramatic on his
platform. But his lecture is very thin stuff. I heard him describe
the sham family. Ezra Penniman and Anastasia Johnson,--if I have
their names right,--were portrayed justly enough, and all the
others of the intermarried Penniman-Johnson family; and the bits
were all fair, and in the direction of justice and good sense. But
the satire was of the mildest sort. Mr De Cordova is, among the
lecturers, what one of the illustrated weeklies of the poorer sort
would be among newspapers, provided it were better printed and on
better paper. There is no wit in him, and no humor. His audience,
however, seemed pleased, and not bored by his vivacious
nothingness. Nasby applied his remarkable powers of irony and fun
to the woman question. I have a little doubt whether his lecture
was enjoyed by all his hearers. In the first place the woman cause
is not so far advanced that a lecturer who supports the common
sense view can be sure of the entire sympathy of an average Boston
audience. The Fraternity ticket holders may be supposed to be more
radically inclined than any others, but there must be, even among
these, many ignorant persons, such as follow Fulton, who are not
converted, and are probably incapable of conversion. Then the
finest irony, such as Nasby's requires, except in the quickest
witted, rather too great a strain of attention for its full
appreciation, and for this reason I think Nasby would do well to
make his lecture (at least until the people become familiar with
the woman question,) mainly argumentative, and let the irony and
fun come in frequently and in spurts. I noticed that when, near the
close of his speech, he left his assumed character of the
conservative, and spoke earnestly in his true radical shape, he got
the largest amount of applause. By and by, when the apologists for
the subjection of woman are as few and as bad-charactered as the
apologists for slavery, Nasby's lecture will be as greatly relished
as his wonderful letters. His manner on the stage is not specially
happy. He reads, and hurries through his lecture. Lowell says of
Alcott, comparing him to a lamb, that "he goes to sure death when
he goes to his pen," and I might almost say, so great is the
difference between Nasby as a lecturer and as a writer, that he
goes to his death when he goes <i>from</i> his pen. But this would
not be true. His lecture was a success. It was in argument
admirable. Nobody in this country has so keen a scent for a humbug
as Nasby. How much he did for us by his inimitable satires upon
Johnson and the negro-hating democracy. And now, as I am rejoiced
to see, he makes his quarry that glorified and ermined imposture,
Chief Justice Chase, and I wish him equal success in hunting him
down. May he live long to lecture as well as to write. Mark Twain
is a man of a different sort. He (and Nasby also as I am informed),
was very nervous at the idea of meeting a Boston audience, though
what there is in a Boston audience to frighten anybody I cannot
imagine. Boston people are moved by the same appeals, they laugh at
the same jokes, yawn at the same dullness, wonder at the same
platitudes, as other people. There was no occasion for anxiety in
either case. Twain cut his lecture short, finishing it at about 20
minutes before nine, evidently afraid that he was boring his
hearers. The best tribute I can give to his performance is to say
that I was very sorry to lose the other half hour, to which, as a
paying dead-head critic, I thought myself entitled. The lecture was
delivered without notes, and so, prima facie, had an advantage over
Nasby's. Voice, manner, gesticulation, were all good; and the
drawl, whether natural or a trick of art, was an effective aid to
the story and the joke. There was no inconsiderable amount of
information about the Sandwich Islands and the Kanakas, and some
admirable bits of description, so admirable, indeed, that I felt
myself a little misused when, getting ready to applaud a genuine
piece of eloquence, I was interrupted by the remark, in a low tone,
"There, I'm glad I've got that volcano off my mind." Or, "There, I
call that rather neat." The Advertiser has so cleverly picked out
the plums of this discourse, that I will not quote much. The remark
about the islanders' dish of plain dog, that "it is only our
cherished American sausage with the mystery removed," is likely to
live as long as the best of the anti-sausage jokes. The story of
the man who was thrown into the air by the premature explosion of a
blast, while he was tamping the charge, and who went up and up till
he was but a speck in the sky, and then came down and down and
struck his crowbar into the same hole and went on tamping again,
was irresistibly funny, and its nub, viz: that the man, though gone
only fifteen minutes, had that amount of time deducted from his
pay, was better even than the story itself. The proposition to
illlustrate cannibalism by an experiment if anyone among the
audience would contribute a baby for the purpose, was perhaps the
funniest thing in the lecture, and it is hard to describe the dry
style of his following remark, quoted in the Advertiser, "I am
aware, though, that children have become scarce and high of late,
having been thinned out by neglect and ill-treatment since the
woman movement began." On the whole, Mark Twain is not only a
genuine humorist,--that we all know,--but an enjoyable and
successful lecturer.</p>
