<b><font size="+1">AMUSEMENTS.<br>
 The Twain-Cable Readings.</font></b><br>
 

<p>The most unique and thoroughly enjoyable entertainment ever
given in Indianapolis was the Mark Twain- George W. Cable readings
at Plymouth Church, last night, and they were given before one of
the finest audiences that could be gathered, the auditorium of the
church being completely filled in parquette and galleries. From
first to last the immense assembly was in hearty sympathy with the
readers, and, for a time, it looked as if the intention was to hold
them all night. Mr. Cable's readings were entirely from Dr. Sevier,
and they introduced Mary Richling Narcisse, Kate Riley and
Ristofalo, and, incidentally, Mr. Richling. They were, in
substance, the same selections he read here last winter; but he has
them now in much better control, and is enabled to give more
attention to nicety of expression than then, for he was then too
closely confined to the printed page before him. For the third
number, "Narcisse Putting on Mourning for Lord Byron," Mr. Cable
substituted some Creole songs, which were received with great favor
and heartily encored, to which he responded with the one he sang
here at his former appearance. The best contribution he made to the
evening's entertainment was Mary Richling's night ride, probably
because of its serious contrast to the prevalent humorous tone of
the programme. It was a fine rendering of a fine bit of descriptive
writing, a real picture painted by an artist. Mark Twain is simply
indescribable. The drollery of his appearance and manner invests
the commonplace and wearisome with a freshness and comicality that
is irresistible. The story of King Sollermun, printed in the last
Century, is by no means easy reading. In cold type it seems to be
trivial to the last degree; but as Mr. Clemens gave it last night,
it set the audience in a perfect storm of boisterous merriment. His
introductory dissertation on the peculiar grammatical construction
of the German language, and the "whistling story" he told in answer
to one of the furious encores given him, were his best numbers,
although there was a verisimilitude about his conversation with the
lady at the Lucerne Sweitzer-Rof, wherein they talked about old
times of which he knew and remembered nothing, that appealed to
everybody's experience in a like "trying situation." The last
number of Twain, and of the programme, was the ghost story of the
golden arm, which ended with a thump, starting everyone out of
their seats at a quarter past 10 o'clock, after two hours of
thoroughly enjoyable fun and sentiment. The large, intelligent and
appreciative audience was an indication of the standing of these
two writers in American literature as recognized in
Indianapolis.</p>
