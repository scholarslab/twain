<br>
<p>The "Mark Twain"-Cable readings drew a large audience to
Whitney's last night, a good proportion being composed of those who
enjoyed the readings of the two authors here in December last. Of
the two Mr. Cable is not near as good a raconteur as Mr. Clemens,
although he assumes much more of the manner of the professional
elocutionist. Mr. Cable's selection most pleasing and most
applauded was "Mary's Last Ride," which was narrated in a graphic
manner. He sang, too, the negro boat and love songs admirably.
"Mark Twain"--he should petition the legislature to legally entitle
him to wear his nom de plume for every day use--has that peculiar
sense of humor so dear to the American heart, which finds
expression in the wildest flights of mendacity, or in a gentle
burlesquing of the truth. His manner heightens the effect of
everything he says, because it seems to be utterly unfitted for
public readings, and yet it is thoroughly artistic, and entirely
appropriate to whatever character he represents as speaking.</p>
