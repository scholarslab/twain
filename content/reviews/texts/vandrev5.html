<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN AS A</font>
L<font size="-1">ECTURER</font>.--To say that the audience that
listened to Mark Twain's lecture, at the Metropolitan last night,
was well pleased would be saying what every man and woman present
will attest; but every one would also say that those two words are
so far from properly representing the pleasure afforded, that in
their very tameness they seem to underrate its real value. It is so
common now-a-days to apply high sounding adjectives to all manner
of entertainments, whether of merit or not, that we avoid their use
in noticing the lecture of Mark Twain, in order that it may not be
ranked by our readers along with the very "flat, stale and
unprofitable" productions, that pass under ponderous adjectives for
lectures worth hearing. The impression made on the hearer by the
first few sentences of the lecturer is anything but favorable.
There is in the careless and effortless manner of dropping words as
though they rolled from the speaker's mouth half moulded as it
were, and the lazy roll of the head, a strong indication that he is
to be bored by a commonplace recital of incidents of travel abroad,
interspersed with a few jokes that would be much more enjoyable in
print, than as mumbled by the speaker. The awakening from this
error comes so suddenly, so thoroughly, and so pleasantly too, that
from this point to the close of the lecture, the doubter at first,
is a willing and delighted captive; drinking in every word, gliding
with the lecturer among the thousand gondolas floating on the water
ways of moonlit Venice, laughing at his proofs that the girls of
Venice are like the girls of Indianapolis, answering with applause
that he would not if he could withhold the thrilling and
surpassingly beautiful descriptions of Athens by moonlight, of the
cathedrals of Milan, and Rome, and St. Petersburg; and then again
laughing himself into tears over the peculiarly happy of the bold,
unceremonious, care-for-nothing, rollicking conduct of the American
vandal, who never fails to make known his nationality, whether in
stocking feet inspecting the interior of a Turkish mosque, among
thousands of worshipping Moslems, attending the <i>fetes</i> of
Emperors or autocrats, rambling among the grand and inspiring ruins
of Athens, or whistling a national air as he views the towering
Pyramids of Egypt.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's wit is always of the highest order, and the more
enjoyable in that it so truthfully hits off some peculiarity of
human nature. His descriptions of scenery, in a literary point of
view, glitter with the polish of culture, and captivate by the
beauty and smoothness of the verbiage. His reading of the
descriptive passages is peculiarly adapted to the display of their
beauties. He reads as one who is not laboring to convey the
impression that he is saying something beautiful, but as one who is
laboring rather to convey to the hearer a correct idea of the
beauties that impressed him. The reader of his prose would discover
in it the music of poetry; but as he reads it, it has all <i>
that</i> charm, and the additional interest that a story has,
coming from the lips of one who saw whereof he speaks.</p>
