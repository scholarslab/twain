<p>MARK TWAIN'S "Tom Sawyer" is an interesting record of boyish
adventure; but, amusing as it is, it may yet be fair to ask whether
its most marked fault is not too strong adherence to conventional
literary models? A glance at the book certainly does not confirm
this opinion, but those who recall the precocious affection of Tom
Sawyer, at the age when he is losing his first teeth, for a little
girl whom he has seen once or twice, will confess that the modern
novel exercises a very great influence. What is best in the book,
what one remembers, is the light we get into the boy's heart. The
romantic devotion to the little girl, the terrible adventures with
murderers and in huge caves, have the air of concessions to jaded
readers. But when Tom gives the cat Pain-Killer, is restless in
church, and is recklessly and eternally deceiving his aunt, we are
on firm ground--the author is doing sincere work.</p>

<p>This later book, "Huckleberry Finn," has the great advantage of
being written in autobiographical form. This secures a unity in the
narration that is most valuable; every scene is given, not
described; and the result is a vivid picture of Western life forty
or fifty years ago. While "Tom Sawyer" is scarcely more than an
apparently fortuitous collection of incidents, and its thread is
one that has to do with murders, this story has a more intelligible
plot. Huckleberry, its immortal hero, runs away from his worthless
father, and floats down the Mississippi on a raft, in company with
Jim, a runaway negro. This plot gives great opportunity for varying
incidents. The travelers spend some time on an island; they outwit
every one they meet; they acquire full knowledge of the hideous
fringe of civilization that then adorned that valley; and the book
is a most valuable record of an important part of our motley
American civilization.</p>

<p>What makes it valuable is the evident truthfulness of the
narrative, and where this is lacking and its place is taken by
ingenious invention, the book suffers. What is inimitable, however,
is the reflection of the whole varied series of adventures in the
mind of the young scapegrace of a hero. His undying fertility of
invention, his courage, his manliness in every trial, are an
incarnation of the better side of the ruffianism that is one result
of the independence of Americans, just as hypocrisy is one result
of the English respect for civilization. The total absence of
morbidness in the book--for the <i>mal du siecle</i> has not yet
reached Arkansas--gives it a genuine charm; and it is interesting
to notice the art with which this is brought out. The best instance
is perhaps to be found in the account of the feud between the
Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords, which is described only as it
would appear to a semi-civilized boy of fourteen, without the
slightest condemnation or surprise,--either of which would be bad
art,--and yet nothing more vivid can be imagined. That is the way
that a story is best told, by telling it, and letting it go to the
reader unaccompanied by sign-posts or directions how he shall
understand it and profit by it. Life teaches its lessons by
implication, not by didactic preaching; and literature is at its
best when it is an imitation of life and not an excuse for
instruction.</p>

<p>As to the humor of Mark Twain, it is scarcely necessary to
speak. It lends vividness to every page. The little touch in "Tom
Sawyer," page 105, where after the murder of which Tom was an
eye-witness, it seemed "that his school-mates would never get done
holding inquests on dead cats and thus keeping the trouble present
to his mind," and that in the account of the spidery six-armed girl
of Emmeline's picture in "Huckleberry Finn," are in the author's
happiest vein. Another admirable instance is to be seen in
Huckleberry Finn's mixed feelings about rescuing Jim, the negro,
from slavery. His perverted views regarding the unholiness of his
actions are most instructive and amusing. It is possible to feel,
however, that the fun in the long account of Tom Sawyer's
artificial imitation of escapes from prison is somewhat forced;
everywhere simplicity is a good rule, and while the account of the
Southern <i>vendetta</i> is a masterpiece, the caricature of books
of adventure leaves us cold. In one we have a bit of life; in the
other Mark Twain is demolishing something that has no place in the
book.</p>

<p>Yet the story is capital reading, and the reason of its great
superiority to "Tom Sawyer" is that is it, for the most part, a
consistent whole. If Mark Twain would follow his hero through
manhood, he would condense a side of American life that, in a few
years, will have to be delved out of newspapers, government
reports, county histories, and misleading traditions by
unsympathetic sociologists.</p>
