<h2><i>British Quarterly Review</i> [unsigned]<br>
 1876: October</h2>

<p>Tom Sawyer is a bit of a scamp, a kind of juvenile Gil Blas, an
<i>enfant terrible</i>, a schoolboy full of practical jokes and
solemn impositions, who wins a Sunday-school Bible by buying
tickets, and proves his assiduous study by the astounding answer to
the question, "Who were the first two apostles?" "David and
Goliath." He absconds from school, and with a village ne'er-do-well
sets up for a pirate on an island in the river, then steals home at
night to listen to his old aunt weeping over him as drowned, and is
furtively present on Sunday to hear his funeral sermon preached. In
one of his escapades he is witness of a midnight murder--gets lost
in a cave on the Mississippi, finds the murderer and his treasure,
and ends his schoolboy days by being a hero. The book is full of
roaring fun, interspersed with touches of true pathos. It will have
the effect of making boys think that an unscrupulous scapegrace is
sure to turn out a noble man; it might therefore have given more
emphasis to truth and straightforwardness. But it is irresistible;
fully up to the mark of the "Innocents Abroad."</p>
