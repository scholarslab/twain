<center><b>MARK TWAIN.<br>
</b>
<hr width="30%">
<b>"Our Fellow Citizens of the Sandwich<br>
Islands."</b></center>

<p>Samuel L. Clemens, better known perhaps as Mark Twain, the
humorist, lectured in Union Place Hall, West Troy, last night upon
the above interesting topic. Mr. C. came hither under the auspices
of Roy steamer company, and was greeted with a full house. The
lecture gave a world of satisfaction. Those who went to laugh were
abundantly satisfied; those who went from any other cause must have
been likewise well pleased, for notwithstanding some things that
are repulsive about them no one can fail to like "our fellow
savages." Mr. Twain is a man about thirty-five or forty years of
age, somewhat tall and spare-built, and has the regular Western
knack of telling a story. Next Winter Mark must make his bow to a
Troy audience. We present a brief report of the lecture below:</p>

<p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen:</i>
The--next--lecture--in--this--course--will--be--delivered this
evening, by Samuel L. Clemens,--a gentleman--whose--high--character
and unimpeachable integrity--are only equalled by
his--comeliness--of--person--and--grace--of--manner.
And--I--am--the--man! You will excuse me for introducing myself,
for I have just excused the chairman from introducing me. The fact
is no chairman can introduce me as I ought to be introduced.
(Laughter.)</p>

<p>I come now to the Sandwich Islands, and shall tell the truth
about them as nearly as I can. If I do embellish with some nonsense
it is of no consequence. This nonsense is the ornamental barnacle
that clings to the oyster. As I was reared a good way from
tide-water, I don't really know whether the barnacle clings to the
oyster or not--but I do.</p>

<p>When Capt. Cook discovered these islands, though another man
came very near discovering them two weeks before, they contained
four hundred thousand souls. White men came and brought complicated
diseases, civilization, education and other calamities, and shortly
the natives began to die off with commendable zeal. Forty years ago
they were reduced to two hundred thousand, and by the last census
they had dwindled down to fifty-five thousand. It is proposed to
start a few more seminaries of learning and finish them off. It is
not education or civilization that is doing this--it is the
importation of disease. Owing to consumption and other reliable
diseases, the natives are retiring from business very fast. In
color the natives are a rich, dark brown--a sort of black and tan.
A very pleasing tint. The easy-going ways they have inherited from
their ancestors have made them idle, but not vicious. They are a
very excellent people. The native women wear a single, long, loose
garment. But the men don't. When there is a public ceremony the men
wear cotton umbrellas, or some little fancy article like that; but
further than this, they don't seem to have any inclination to
gorgeousness of attire. After speaking of the absolute sway of the
old-time kings, and the degradation of their subjects, the lecturer
spoke of the women.</p>

<p>Down at the bottom of all this degradation and misery came the
women. They were abject slaves--degraded to the ranks of brutes and
beasts. No better. They had no privileges. It was death for a woman
to eat at the table with her own husband. Death for her to eat of
the choice fruits. Even those poor debased savages had a notion of
what had come by woman's eating the forbidden fruit. By and by the
American missionaries broke the power of the chiefs, and lifted the
wives to an equality with the men. The missionaries set up schools
and taught them to read and write with facility, and there is not a
single ignorant person there now. They are the best educated people
in the world. I can testify to the zeal of the missionaries, and to
their faith and devotion. Still, all this work, extending over so
many years and costing so much, was carried on by Sunday school
children. We all took part in it. True, the system gave
opportunities to bad boys. Many a bad boy acquired the habit of
confiscating pennies of the missionary cause. But it is the
proudest reflection of my life that I never did that--at least not
more than once or twice.</p>

<p>The natives are very hospitable. They will give you a seat in
their cabin, and fresh fish, raw salt pork, baked dog, stewed cats,
and all the luxuries of the season. But when it comes to business
matters it is a different thing entirely--they will tell you one
falsehood after another--lies that will awe you with their
grandeur--that are stunning in sublimity. It doesn't discommode the
native in the least to do this. And he slides out of it with an
ease that is charming. Every one of them has half a dozen mothers.
I don't mean to say natural mothers, but adopted ones. They have a
custom of calling any woman "mother" that they have taken a fancy
to. You see at once that a native may have one hundred and fifty
mothers. This custom breeds some curious incidents. A California
gentleman who owned a sugar plantation hired one of these natives
to work for him in the busy season. He soon came to ask leave to
bury his mother. Shortly after he came again with the same request.
"I thought you buried her last week," said the gentleman. "This is
another one," said the native. "All right," said the gentleman, "go
and plant her." After a few more such requests the planter said
that he thought that his stock of mothers held out pretty well, and
told him to clear out and not come back again till he had buried
every mother he had in the world.</p>

<p>The natives of these islands are very fond of dogs. Not the
magnificent Newfoundlands nor the graceful greyhound--but
insignificant curs that a white man would despise. There is not a
handsome feature about them unless it is their tail. And there is
nothing extraordinary about that. A friend of mine said that if he
owned one he would cut his tail off and throw the balance of the
dog away. But the natives love these pups--they feed them from
their own hands, sleep with them, pet them, till they have grown to
mature doghood, and then eat them. Now I couldn't do that. I would
rather go hungry two days than devour an old personal friend. A
native of these islands will eat anything that he can bite. They
will take a fresh fish right out of the water and eat him. Of
course it is inconvenient to the fish, but the native enjoys it. It
used to be a popular belief that these islanders were cannibals.
But cannibalism never existed there, except in one instance. And
this cannibal was a foreigner who opened an office there and ate a
good many of the natives. He did a large business in this line. In
other cities, at this point in my discourse, it is my custom to
illustrate cannibalism. But being a stranger here I don't feel at
liberty to ask favors. Still, if any one in the audience would lend
me an infant. [Laughter.] However, it doesn't matter. I know that
little children have grown scarce and high, on account of neglect
and inattention since the woman movement set in.</p>

<p>Well, as I say, the cannibal opened his establishment there, but
they say that by and by he got tired of his diet. Well, anybody
would. So he thought he would like to try and see how a white man
would go--and so he lay in wait, and captured a venerable
whaling-ship captain, sixty-five years in the service. The cannibal
did the best he could, but it was the worst thing he ever did. Of
course, he could no more digest that old whaler than a keg of
nails. He suffered. There is no telling how much he suffered, with
this sin on his conscience and the whaler on his stomach. He
lingered for a few days, and then died. Let this be a warning to
you. I don't know myself why it should be a warning to you, but I
notice that when other lecturers mention a historical fact they do
not believe in themselves, they always back it up with a moral.</p>

<p>With all their kindly ways these people practice some cruelties.
They will put a live chicken into hot ashes simply to see it hop
about. They would burn the flesh before the missionaries came, and
would put out an eye, or a tooth, when a chief died. And if their
grief was deep, and they could get relief in no other way, they
would go out and scalp a neighbor. In the season of mourning for a
great person they permit any crime that will best express great
sorrow.</p>

<p>They do everything differently from other people. They mount a
horse from the off side. They turn to the left instead of the
right. They say the same words for "good bye" and "how do you do."
They always, in beckoning for you to come, motion in the opposite
direction. Even the birds partake of this peculiarity. The native
duck lives four thousand feet above the level of the sea, and never
sees water except when it rains. They (the islanders) grown in a
heart-broken way when they are particularly happy. They have some
customs we might import to advantage. I don't call any to mind just
now.</p>

<p>In Honolulu, they are the most easy-going people in the world.
Some of our people are not acquainted with their customs. They
started a gas company once, and put the gas at $13 a thousand feet.
They only took in $16 the first month. They all went to bed at
dark. They are an excellent people. I speak earnestly. They do not
even know the name of some of the vices in this country. A lady
called on a doctor. She wanted something for general debility. He
ordered her to drink porter. She called him again. The porter had
done her no good. He asked her how much porter she had taken. She
said a tablespoonful in a tumbler of water. I wish we could import
such a blessed ignorance into this country. There are low white
people in Hawaii who would drink liquors if they could get them.
They drink kerosene, aqua fortis, hair oil, turpentine. They do say
that the whole population got terrifically drunk on the Fourth of
July on a barrel of Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup.</p>

<p>The islands are delightful, because they are in the tropics. The
thermometer doesn't change more than 12 degrees in twelve months.
It stands at about 70 the year round. You can have any climate you
want. Mountains that rise to a prodigious height, with eternal
snows on the tops. And as you come down you go through the climates
of all the zones, and have the vegetation of all the climes.</p>

<p>I must mention one feature of the place before I close. It would
not be proper to close without speaking of it. The white people
there have a tradition that all the supremely gifted liars in the
world are confined to the Sandwich Islands. They say that a man
named Morgan there will never permit anybody to beat him in telling
a story. When asked if he had heard of the Natural Bridge,
Virginia, he said of course he had, his father helped to build it.
He had the fastest horse in the world, and in a thunder shower once
he ran him eighteen miles and not a single drop of water touched
him, while he dog was swimming all the way behind the wagon. He
told of a company he belonged to in California who hired one fellow
to blast some rock. Owing to carelessness there was an explosion,
and this fellow was blown up in the air till he didn't look any
larger than a little boy--then he looked no larger than a dog--then
no larger than a bird--finally than a bee. And then he began to
descend, and increased in size from a bee to a bird--and a dog--and
a boy--and finally to a full-sized man--coming down in exactly the
same spot where he went up, and began to blast rock immediately on
landing. Morgan said that fellow was gone only fifteen minutes, and
yet they docked him for lost time.</p>

<p>The lecturer here closed his address by thanking his audience
for their attention and wishing them a very pleasant good
night.</p>
