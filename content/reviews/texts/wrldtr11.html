<br>
 Samuel M. Clemens, familiarly known as Mark Twain, arrived in
Cleveland yesterday afternoon on his lecture tour around the globe.
He was accompanied by Mrs. Clemens and their daughter, and by his
manager, Major J.B. Pond and wife. Mr. Clemens and his party took
rooms at The Stillman, and as Mr. Clemens is suffering from a very
painful carbuncle on his leg he spent much of his time in bed. He
bore his affliction with surprising heroism, however, and even
consented to half a score of interviews in addition, without so
much as complaining.

<p>"So far as Joan of Arc is concerned," he said, when asked about
the authorship of the memoirs now being published in Harper's
Magazine, "I have been asked that question several times. I have
always considered it wise, however, to leave an unclaimed piece of
literary property alone until time has shown that no one is going
to claim it. Then it is safe to acknowledge you wrote that, whether
you did or not. It is in this way that I have become recognized and
respected as the author of 'Beautiful Snow,' 'Rocked in the Cradle
of the Deep' and other literary gems."</p>

<p>When asked how he came to take the nom de plume of Mark Twain he
said that that well known equivalent for "two fathoms" on the
sounding line had been used as a nom de plume for a few marine
notes furnished a New Orleans paper by the oldest captain on the
river -- Isaiah Sellers. "When the word came out to Virginia City
that Sellers was dead," said he, "I did not think it would be much
of a crime to rob that corpse of that nom de plume, and I did
so."</p>

<p>Mark Twain, the American humorist, stood before an immense
audience in Music hall last evening and demonstrated his latest
scheme for the moral regeneration of the human race. The speaker
appeared in this city over ten years ago and the decade has wrought
great changes in his appearance. His immense shock of hair has
turned nearly white, but his humor is just as vigorous and his
style as entertaining as ever. Mr. Clemens has been ill for several
weeks and his appearance last evening was almost on the eve of his
long contemplated tour around the world by way of Australia. His
lecture was given for the benefit of the News-boys' home.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's theory for the moral regeneration of the race is
sensationally unique. He proposes that man shall be guilty of the
entire category of crimes and misdemeanors, thereby gaining
impressions of wickedness which he will never forget, and by the
experience thus gained he will shun wickedness. The audience became
convulsed when the speaker deliberately assured them that he had
passed through two-thirds of the crimes of which the human race is
capable and that he hoped in a few more years to complete the list
and reach the stage of perfect moral manhood. His matter of fact
manner in reaching startling conclusions is one of the chief powers
of the great humorist.</p>

<p>The effort of Mr. Clemens was preluded by two very pleasing
violin solos by Fiora Drescher of New York and a couple of flute
solos by Mr. Dewey Haywood of Chicago.</p>

<p>Miss Drescher is a very beautiful woman, with large, dark eyes
and dark hair. She plays with a great deal of expression and
feeling. Her violin is over a hundred years old and has been owned
by Remenyi, Ole Bull and Camilla Urso. Mr. Haywood is the husband
of Miss Drescher. They were married three weeks ago today in
Chicago. Mr. H.J. Kroessen of this city was accompanist.</p>
