<p>L<font size="-1">YCEUM</font>. -- Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens)
will lecture before the Lyceum, on Friday evening of this week.
This is "Mark's" first appearance in our city. We would advise all
who can appreciate sparkling wit and genial humor, to provide
themselves with a ticket and wend their way to Collingwood's Opera
House, on Friday evening, nothing fearing that they will receive an
adequate return from their investment.</p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font>. --
There was a fine audience at Collingwood Opera House last evening,
the occasion being a lecture on the Sandwich Islands by Mark Twain.
-- There was much original humor in the lecturer, and too at times
he gave splendid illustrations of natural scenery on that far off
land. It was a very enjoyable entertainment, and every one in the
audience seemed pleased.</p>
