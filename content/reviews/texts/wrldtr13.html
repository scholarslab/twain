He Pleases a Large Audience in Evans' Opera House.</b><br>
<br>
 Samuel L. Clemens, known to the world as Mark Twain, stood before
an audience composed of some of the best people of Anaconda, in
Evans' opera house last evening. The entertainment was
characteristic, it was as original in style as are the writings of
the man. It was not a lecture, not exactly readings, the author
simply ascended the platform and began to talk as though he were in
a parlor, and in the course of a one-sided conversation he told six
or seven stories, one after the other, until an hour and a half
went by and no one had noticed the time in its flight.

<p>Mark Twain in a dress suit and an immaculate expanse of white
shirt front has none of the slouchy appearance that his latest
pictures give to him, on the contrary, he is spruce and trim. He
has a shaggy bunch of iron-gray hair about his head, and his eyes
are set deep under a broad forehead. He speaks with a twang and a
drawl that is in keeping with his humor and would be amusing if he
were speaking solemnly, but when it is used in telling funny
stories it is more than amusing, it produces spontaneous laughter
in every audience he has ever tried it on. Acaconda people were no
exception, they are enjoyed the programme and will long remember
the night they saw and heard Mark Twain.</p>
