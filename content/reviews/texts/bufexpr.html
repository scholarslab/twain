<h2>Buffalo Express [unsigned]<br>
 1869: October 16</h2>
</center>

<p>If any book of late years has so generally interested the press
of the country and received so extensive and favorable an
introduction to the public as has Mark Twain's <i>Innocents
Abroad,</i> since its appearance, we fail to remember the instance.
We gave to our readers last week, in a supplementary sheet, some
specimens of the notices we have found in our exchanges. Numerous
as were the excerpts here collected, they represent but a fraction
of what have fallen under our observation, and the notable fact is,
that, instead of the mere mention so commonly accorded to a new
book, almost every journal has given it an unusually elaborate
review, written not in a simple spirit of courtesy, but evidentally
with an inspiration of interest excited by reading the work. The
truth is, we believe, that no one of an ordinary disposition of
mind can dip into the volume without being snared by a curious
fascination. It is so different from any narrative of travel that
ever was written before. The mere tickle of an ever pervading humor
is not all that makes it delightful, but that humor is like an
atmosphere, in which the old world scenes that so many tourists and
travellers have led us into, take on a new and altogether novel
appearance, so that we follow our droll excursionist from place to
place as eagerly as though we had never been carried to them by any
narrative before. It would be a great mistake to suppose that the
book is just a big package of Mark Twain's jokes, to be read with
laughter, and for the sake of laughter. It is the panorama of
Europe and the Holy Land as they were seen by one who went abroad
with no illusions; who carried about with him a shrewd pair of
American eyes, and used them to get his own impressions of things,
as they actually presented themselves, not as he had been taught to
expect them; who bore with him, moreover, as acute an appreciation
of sham and humbug as his sense of the humorous and ludicrous was
keen. What he saw he tells, and we believe there is more true
description in his book than in any other of the kind that we have
read. What is to be told soberly he tells soberly, and with all the
admiration or reverence that is due to the subject. But he does
like to wash off false colors, to scrape away putty and varnish, to
stick a pin into venerable moss grown shams -- and it is a
perpetual delight to his reader to see him do it in his droll, dry
way. We have yet to find the person who could open the book and
willingly lay it down again, for, certainly, it is not often that
more or livelier entertainment can be had in the same compass. The
work has been published by the American Publishing Company, at
Hartford, and is sold by agents who canvass for subscriptions.</p>

The Critical Heritage</i>, p. 25) -- or MT could have written it
himself.]</p>
