 <b><font size="+1">MARK TWAIN AND CABLE.</font></b><br>
<br>
 Every chair in Market hall was occupied last evening. The
audience, fully half made up of ladies, was fairly representative
of St. Paul culture. The occasion was the first appearance in St.
Paul of Mark Twain, the humorist, and George W. Cable, the
novelist, in their literary Siamese-twin act. Mr. Cable came on the
stage first. He is a slight-built man, decidedly below the average
in stature, has small, twinkling, brownish-black eyes, features
almost femininely delicate, hair brushed carefully back from a
square forehead of medium height, small, graceful hands, and last
night wore a full, glossy black beard, with long, drooping
moustache of the same color, and a dress suit. Several persons were
entering the hall as Mr. Cable made his bow. He referred pleasantly
to the chronic habit of late coming in theater-goers, but begged
that the audience would try to devote a few moments from inspecting
the costumes of the late comers to the speaker on the stage. Mr.
Cable then read a chapter from his latest novel, "Dr. Sevier,"
throwing considerable expressive feeling into the delivery. The
reading occupied about twenty minutes, and the audience applauded
heartily. Mr. Cable bowed three times, and then made his escape to
the rear of the stage with a peculiar, pigeon-wing kind of
movement.

<p>Two or three minutes later Mark Twain came on. The audience
greeted him with a round of hearty hand-clapping. Twain wore his
habitually tired, unemotional look, and received the applause as
though it was something he had been accustomed to from infancy, but
was obliged to endure politely. He stepped quietly up to the desk
in the middle of the stage, placed his right hand upon it (the
desk), shoved his left hand down into his breeches' pocket, on the
left side, and looked as intensely weary as if he had just walked
in from Milwaukee and had not had time to get anything to eat
before coming on the stage. Any one ignorant of the humorist's
identity would have taken him for one of the chief mourners at a
well-regulated funeral, or a life-long victim of dyspepsia and
melancholia, in the acutest forms. He began business at once. His
voice was the same old, characteristic nasal drawl, in which the
public refused to see anything eloquent, or even pleasing, when he
essayed (unsuccessfully) to be a lecturer some ten years ago, but
which is now accepted as almost as convulsive as the humorist's
utterances themselves. Twain began last night by saying that the
first number on the program with which his name was mixed up was a
chapter from "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," a new infliction
by himself. He went on to relate "King Sollermun," with which the
public is already familiar from having seen the anecdote in print
in the Century magazine and various newspapers. The audience
laughed and laughed and applauded heartily again at the close of
the reading.</p>

<p>The other selections were: "Kate Riley, Richling, and
Ristofalo," from "Dr. Sevier," by Mr. Cable; "Tragic Tale of the
Fishwife," Mark Twain; Creole folk-songs, Mr. Cable, and the story
of the "Woman With the Golden Arm," Mark Twain. The last named is a
ghost-story, which Twain brings abruptly to a close by jumping
toward the audience and crying "B-oo-o!" when the audience jumps,
too, and then goes home in the very best of humor.</p>
