<center><font size=+1><b>Mark Twain's New Book</b></font></center>
<p>In starting out to set down the adventures and observations of "Pudd'nhead Wilson,"
  Mark Twain had in mind the production of a short story, but "Pudd'nhead
  Wilson" refused to confine himself to the limits of a magazine sketch, and now he has
  become a large book, a part of which is a spirited farce called <i>Those
  Extraordinary Twins</i>.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is one of the wittiest and most original
  characters Twain has produced.  There was not in him the capacity to be grave, despite
  the solemnity of some of the positions in which he found himself.  This curious volume is
  as full of the characteristic humor of Twain as is the best of his work.  In this book he
  seems to have recovered much of his old-time spirit--spirit that has been conscpicous by
  its absence in a great deal of Twain's work printed during the past ten years.  The artist
  that illustrates this work has a very keen sense of humor; indeed, his appreciation of the
  author's humor is greater than his skill as a draughtsman.  The outline drawings are often
  crude, but there is humor in every line of them.</p>
