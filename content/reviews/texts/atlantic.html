<p>The character of American humor, and its want of resemblance to
the humor of Kamtschatka and Patagonia, -- will the reader forgive
us if we fail to set down here the thoughts suggested by these
fresh and apposite topics? Will he credit us with a self-denial
proportioned to the vastness of Mr. Clements's very amusing book,
if we spare to state why he is so droll, or -- which is as much to
the purpose -- why we do not know? This reticence will leave us
very little to say by way of analysis; and, indeed, there is very
little to say of <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> which is not of the
most obvious and easy description. The idea of a steamer-load of
Americans going on a prolonged picnic to Europe and the Holy Land
is itself almost sufficiently delightful, and it is perhaps praise
enough for the author to add that it suffers nothing from his
handling. If one considers the fun of making a volume of six
hundred octavo pages upon this subject, in compliance with one of
the main conditions of a subscription book's success, bigness
namely, one has a tolerably fair piece of humor, without troubling
Mr. Clements further. It is out of the bounty and abundance of his
own nature that he is as amusing in the execution as in the
conception of his work. And it is always good-humored humor, too,
that he lavishes on his reader, and even in its impudence it is
charming; we do not remember where it is indulged at the cost of
the weak or helpless side, or where it is insolent, with all its
sauciness and irreverence. The standard shams of travel which
everybody sees through suffer possibly more than they ought, but
not so much as they might; and one readily forgives the harsh
treatment of them in consideration of the novel piece of justice
done on such a traveller as suffers under the pseudonyme of Grimes.
It is impossible also that the quality of humor should not
sometimes be strained in the course of so long a narrative; but the
wonder is rather in the fact that it is strained so seldom.</p>

<p>Mr. Clements gets a good deal of his fun out of his
fellow-passengers, whom he makes us know pretty well, whether he
presents them somewhat caricatured, as in the case of the "Oracle"
of the ship, or carefully and exactly done, as in the case of such
a shrewd, droll, business-like, sensible, kindly type of the
American young man as "Dan." We must say also that the artist who
has so copiously illustrated the volume has nearly always helped
the author in the portraiture of his fellow-passengers, instead of
hurting him, which is saying a good deal for an artist; in fact, we
may go further and apply the commendation to all the illustrations;
and this in spite of the variety of figures in which the same
persons are represented, and the artist's tendency to show the
characters on mules where the author says they rode horseback.</p>

<p>Of course the instructive portions of Mr. Clements's book are of
a general rather than particular character, and the reader gets as
travel very little besides series of personal adventures and
impressions; he is taught next to nothing about the population of
the cities and the character of the rocks in the different
localities. Yet the man who can be honest enough to let himself see
the realities of human life everywhere, or who has only seen
Americans as they are abroad, has not travelled in vain and is far
from a useless guide. The very young American who told the English
officers that a couple of our gunboats could come and knock
Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea; the American who at a French
restaurant "talked very loudly and coarsely, and laughed
boisterously, where all others were so quiet and well behaved," and
who ordered "wine, sir!" adding, to raise admiration in a country
where wine is as much a matter of course as soup, "I never dine
without wine, sir"; the American who had to be addressed several
times as Gordon, being so accustomed to hear the name pronounced
Gorrdong, and who had forgotten most English words during a three
months' sojourn in Paris; the Americans who pitilessly made a three
days' journey in Palestine within two days, cruelly overworking the
poor beasts they rode, and overtaxing the strength of their
comrades, in order not to break the Sabbath; the American Pilgrims
who travelled half round the world to be able to take a sail on the
Sea of Galilee, and then missed their sole opportunity because they
required the boatman to take them for one napoleon when he wanted
two; -- these are all Americans who are painted to peculiar
advantage by Mr. Clements, and who will be easily recognized by
such as have had the good fortune to meet them abroad.</p>

<p>The didactic, however, is not Mr. Clements's prevailing mood,
nor his best, by any means. The greater part of his book is in the
vein of irony, which, with a delicious impudence, he attributes to
Saint Luke, declaring that Luke, in speaking of the winding
"street, called Straight" in Damascus, "is careful not to commit
himself; he does not say it is the street which <i>is</i> straight,
but the street which is <i>called</i> Straight.' It is a fine piece
of irony; it is the only facetious remark in the Bible, I believe."
At Tiberias our author saw the women who wear their dowry in their
head-dresses of coins. "Most of these maidens were not wealthy, but
some few have been kindly dealt with by fortune. I saw heiresses
there, worth, in their own right, -- worth, well, I suppose I might
venture to say as much as nine dollars and a half. But such cases
are rare. When you come across one of these, she naturally puts on
airs." He thinks the owner of the horse "Jericho," on which he
travelled towards Jerusalem, "had a wrong opinion about him. He had
an idea that he was one of those fiery, untamed, steeds, but he is
not of that character. I know the Arab had this idea, because when
he brought the horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking
at the bridle and shouting in Arabic, Ho! will you? Do you want to
run away, you ferocious beast, and break your neck?' when all the
time the horse was not doing anything in the world, and only looked
like he wanted to lean up against something and think. Whenever he
is not shying at things or reaching after a fly, he wants to do
that yet. How it would surprise his owner to know this!" In this
vein of ironical drollery is that now celebrated passage in which
Mr. Clements states that he was affected to tears on coming, a
stranger in a strange land, upon the grave of a blood-relation, --
the tomb of Adam; but that passage is somewhat more studied in tone
than most parts of the book, which are written with a very
successful approach in style to colloquial drolling. As Mr.
Clements writes of his experiences, we imagine he would talk of
them; and very amusing talk it would be: often not at all fine in
matter or manner, but full of touches of humor, -- which if not
delicate are nearly always easy, -- and having a base of excellent
sense and good feeling. There is an amount of pure human nature in
the book, that rarely gets into literature; the depths of our poor
unregeneracy -- dubious even of the blissfulness of bliss -- are
sounded by such a simple confession as Mr. Clements makes in
telling of his visit to the Emperor of Russia: "I would as soon
have thought of being cheerful in Abraham's bosom as in the palace
of an Emperor." Almost any topic, and any event of the author's
past life, he finds pertinent to the story of European and Oriental
travel, and if the reader finds it impertinent, he does not find it
the less amusing. The effect is dependent in so great degree upon
this continuous incoherence, that no chosen passage can illustrate
the spirit of the whole, while the passage itself loses half in
separation from the context. Nevertheless, here is part of the
account given by Mr. Clements of the Pilgrims' excursion to the
river Jordan, over roads supposed to be infested by Bedouins; and
the reader who does not think it droll as it stands can go to our
author for the <a name="1">rest</a>.</p>

55]</a></center>

<p>Under his <i>nom de plume</i> of Mark Twain, Mr. Clements is
well known to the very large world of newspaper-readers; and this
book ought to secure him something better than the uncertain
standing of a popular favorite. It is no business of ours to fix
his rank among the humorists California has given us, but we think
he is, in an entirely different way from all the others, quite
worthy of the company of the best.</p>

<p>[Soon after writing this review Howells would meet MT for the
first time; he hadn't yet met him, however, and for reasons that
are unclear thought his MT's real name was "Samuel S.
Clements."]</p>
