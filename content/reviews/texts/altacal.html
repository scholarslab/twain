<h2>San Francisco <i>Daily Alta California</i> [unsigned]<br>
1877: January 15</h2>

<p>Tom Sawyer was a boy, not one of the sort that you read about in
good books, but a little devil, never malicious and always at some
trick, and in the course of years he engaged in a multitude, all of
which are here recorded in Twain's style. He had special aversions
for church, Sunday school, pious people, devout conversation and
the company of his sedate but good old aunt. In spite of his
efforts to escape from such inflictions he had to suffer them once
in a while, but in his efforts to get some diversion on such
occasions he more than once made lively sensations. Too lazy to get
his Sunday school lessons, he managed by sharp trading to buy up a
lot of the tickets given to the best pupils, and when a
distinguished visitor came the children were requested to step
forward with their tickets so that the one who had the most should
receive the prize. To the astonishment of all Tom Sawyer was the
hero, and, after a great time had been made over him, the visitor
thought Tom should have a chance to show his learning, so he asked
him who were the first two of the twelve Apostles to follow Jesus,
it being presumed that the prize boy knew such things perfectly,
for the lesson of the term had been in the study of the four
Gospels. Tom felt the necessity of giving some answer, and his was
"David and Goliath," to the surprise of the visitor, the
consternation of the head teacher and the amusement of the school.
When Tom went to church he took a large snapping bug (which has a
grip like a crab) with him, and it got hold of a church-going dog,
which rushed around the building and howled in a manner highly
unbecoming to the place. When he was sick his aunt gave him
pain-killer, and when she went out he gave a dose to the cat, which
squawled, rushed around like mad, upsetting everything, and then
jumped through the window, breaking a pane of glass in the way.
Aunt Polly hearing the disturbance and finding the cause, scolded
Tom for being so cruel to the cat, but Tom said she had compelled
him to take pain-killer when he protested, and he had not given it
to pussy till she came and begged for a taste when she saw him pour
it into a spoon. He went to school, and got into trouble on account
of a little girl--both about ten years old. Having read about the
romantic life of pirates, Tom and two companions of the same age
stole a little raft, on which they floated a few miles on the
Mississippi to a small uninhabited island, where they remained
three days, while their relatives mourned their supposed death by
drowning, and when they were discovered and brought back there was
great rejoicing, and Tom was looked at by other little boys as a
wonderful hero, and he put on awful airs on account of the
sensation he made. What we have told here is merely part of the
outline of the story; the chief merit is in the filling in, which
is full of humorous and acute delineation of the follies,
superstitions and peculiarities of boys, girls and older
people.</p>
