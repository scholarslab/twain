<h2>Boston Sunday <i>Herald</i> [Sylvester Baxter]<br>
 1889: December 15</h2>

<br>
 [<i>This long, enthusiastic review filled up almost a full page in
the</i> Herald<i>. It included six of Dan Beard's illustrations.
But although it summarizes a good bit of the plot, it never sees
any hint of irony in the novel's juxtaposition of ancien t England
and modern America. Like all the contemporary reviews, for example,
it doesn't notice the apocalyptic violence of the last act of
Hank's performance for the Sixth Century.</i>] <br>

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.</font><br>
<br>
Adventures Among the Knights of the Round Table --<br>
Modern Inventions Introduced Into the Sixth Century --<br>
Shams of Aristocratic Pretensions Ruthlessly
Slaughtered</b></center>

<p>Of all the extraordinary conceits that have germinated in his
fruitful imagination, nothing more delicious has ever occurred to
Mark Twain than that of running riot among the legendary times of
our ancestral race by placing "A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur's Court." These quoted words form the title of the latest
successor to <i>Innocents Abroad</i>. Here is a rare field for the
unbridled play of fancy, and right bravely has the author used his
opportunity. There is a most audacious rollicking around among the
dusty bric-a-brac of chivalry -- which is not handled at all gently
-- and a merry tossing about of poetic finery in a way that
ruthlessly exposes in their literal ugliness the illusively mantled
facts. Of course there is most abundant fun, and Mark Twain's rich
humor never coursed more freely than here, where just provocation
is never absent. But there is much more than this; the sources of
the claims of aristocratic privileges and royal prerogatives that
yet linger in the world are so exposed to the full glare of the sun
of 19th century common sense, are shown in so ridiculous an aspect,
that the work can hardly fail to do yeoman service in destroying
the still existing remnants of respect for such pretensions.
Through the book there is a steady flowing undercurrent of earnest
purpose, and the pages are eloquent with a true American love of
freedom, a sympathy with the rights of the common people, and an
indignant hatred of oppression of the poor, the lowly and the weak,
by the rich, the powerful and the proud. While much false glamour
is dispelled by resolving it into absurdity under the touchstone of
truth, the book is marked by real beauty, by a poetry of style
worthy of its rich material, with much sympathetic tenderness, as
well as frankness of speech. The quaint early English speech is
handled with the same artistic skill that characterized the
author's facile handling of the stately Elizabethan in that lovely
idyll of childhood, <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i>, and the
constant admixture of a concisely expressive American vernacular
thereto makes a contrast of lingual coloring that is</p>

<center><b>Unspeakably Delightful.</b></center>

<p>We may fancy that the same matter-of-fact Englishman who
seriously reasoned that certain statements in <i>Innocents
Abroad</i> were preposterously absurd, and could not be based upon
fact, might again step forward to break a lance against this book
by showing, from historical and philological data, that such a
language could not possibly have been spoken in the sixth century,
since the English tongue did not exist, and that the use of Norman
French names before the conquest is anachronistic in the highest
degree! But this is an excursion back into the England of the
chronicles, and not of strict chronology, and that eminent
ethnologist, Tylor, would undoubtedly perceive with delight the
accuracy of scientific perception in the treatment of human nature
which marks the book. For, in order to characterize with truth a
past period we must make ourselves familiar with some existing
state of society that is analogous therewith. Only under such
conditions can a faithful historical romance be written, for
otherwise the writer cannot fail to modernize his work, and falsify
its life with 19th century sentiments that could not have been
known in a previous age. By resorting to the principle that
"distribution in time" is paralleled by "distribution in space," we
may solve many a problem. So there is a certain aspect of sober
truth in this most fanciful tale, and, just as the Connecticut
Yankee went back into the days of King Arthur's court, so might he
go out into the world today, into Central Asia or Africa, or even
into certain spots in this United States of ours, find himself
amidst social conditions very similar to those of 1300 years ago,
and even work his astonishing 19th century miracles with like
result. For it is a fact that, when Frank Hamilton Cushing
astounded the Zuni Indians with an acoustic telephone constructed
of two tomato cans and a string, they deemed him a magician, and
tried him for witchcraft. And, for parallels of the inhumanities
which, as we here read of them, seem to have been left far behind
us in the track of the centuries, we have but to look with George
Kennan into the dungeons of Siberia; and, in our own country, read
the records of the investigations into the horrors of the
almshouses, jails and lunatic hospitals here in this enlightened
commonwealth of Massachusetts so late as the time of Horace Mann,
or look to the record of the nameless barbarities of negro slavery
alive in the memories of men still young. How the conscience and
the sympathies of the world have quickened with the advent of the
railway, the steamship and the telegraph! We have, after all, but
just passed out across</p>

<center><b>The Threshold of the Dark Ages,</b></center>

<p>and, in view of the few steps we have taken, we can hardly doubt
that we are yet to make an infinitely mightier progress into the
light of a genuine civilization, putting far behind us the veneered
barbarism of the present, that still retains the old standards of
conduct and intercourse for our guidance in all "practical"
affairs.</p>

<p>As an instance of the scientific fidelity of this book in its
picture of mediaeval society, we may take this from the description
of the company at King Arthur's Round Table, around which there was
an average of about two dogs to one man, <a name="1">watching
for</a> bones:</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy1.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
2]</a></center>

<p>The following also illustrates an exact perception of the
essentially savage traits of such a people: "Finally it occurred to
me all of a sudden that these animals didn't reason; that they
never put this and that together; that all their talk showed that
they didn't know a discrepancy when they saw it." Again, when Sir
Sagramour le Desirous caught a chance remark of the Yankee applied
to some one else and thought it meant for him, and so challenged
him to the memorable encounter that took place several years after,
and was fought with</p>

<center><b>Lariat Versus Lance,</b></center>

<p>the "Sir Boss," as he was called said: "Whenever one of those
people got a thing into his head, there was no getting it out
again. I knew that, so I saved my breath, and offered no
explanations." The foregoing characterizations might apply equally
well to a tribe of Dakota Indians, to their hardly more civilized
foes, the cowboys of the plains, to the mountaineers of Tennessee
and Georgia, or even to the savages in our great city slums.</p>

<p>By some strange means, perhaps more marvellous than those by
which Edward Bellamy transferred the hero of "Looking Backward"
forward to the year 2000, the Yankee is carried back 1300 years in
time, and in the record of his adventures affords us another and
very instructive sort of "Looking Backward." He is captured by one
of King Arthur's mailed knights, whom at first he takes for a
circus performer, and is carried to Camelot as a prisoner.
Condemned to be burned alive, according to the pleasa nt custom of
the age, he saves himself by threatening to blot out the sun unless
he is set free. He knew that a total eclipse was due as that date,
and, as it begins, the superstitious and credulous people at once
accept his claim to be a great magician, and King Arthur begs him
to let them off and name his own terms. He consents to spare the
sun, but just for a lesson he says he will let the darkness proceed
and spread night in the world, and exacts as his conditions that he
shall be appointed perpetua l prime minister and chief executive to
the King, simply taking for remuneration 1 per cent of such actual
increase of the revenue over and above the present amount as he may
succeed in creating for the state. He then proceeds to run the
kingdom accordin g to modern ideas; he introduces, step by step,
19th century inventions, his magic of modern science putting old
Merlin, with his "parlor magic," quite in the shade. One of the
most comical things in the book is the way in which Merlin, who is
horribly j ealous of his powerful rival, is made to serve as the
arch villain of the story. A bright boy, one of the pages at the
court, whom he calls "Clarence" for short, becomes the right hand
man of the Yankee in carrying out his plans, and is trained
according to the most approved modern ideas,</p>

<center><b>With Striking Results.</b></center>

<p>"What a jump I had made!" <a name="2">mused the</a> Yankee.</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy5.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER

<p>He describes the people as "the quaintest, and simplest, and
trustingest race" though "nothing but rabbits," and, to one born in
a wholesome free atmosphere, it was pitiful to listen to their
protestations of <a name="3">loyalty to royalty</a> and aris
tocracy.</p>

<br>
<center><b>They Were Having Tournaments</b></center>

<p>all the time at Camelot, "and very stirring and picturesque and
ricidulous human bull fights they were, too, but just a little
wearisome to a practical mind. Another popular diversion was going
for the <a name="4">Holy</a> Grail.</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy7.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
9]</a></center>

<p>According to the custom of the age, the Yankee, too, goes off in
search of adventures, accompanied by the Demoiselle Alisande la
Carteloise, who brings in a tale of the usual pattern, all about an
ogre's enchanted castle, with captive maidens, etc. He has a most
ludicrous time getting into his armor, and starts off, with
"Sandy," as he calls her, riding behind him on the same horse. In
his armor he felt hot and uncomfortable, he perspired in rivers, he
itched and couldn't get at <a name="5">himself</a> to scratch.</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy8.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
12]</a></center>

<p>Occasionally he encountered one of his own "missionaries" as he
called them, knights</p>

<center><b>In the Guise of "Sandwich Men,"</b></center>

<p>bearing such inscriptions as "Persimmons' soap -- all the <a
name="6">prime-donne</a> use it!"</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy9.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
16]</a></center>

<p>The adventures encountered upon this expedition are ludicrous
and pathetic by turns; the wrongs and sufferings of the common
people under the degrading conditions of that age are described
with vivid and touching eloquence.</p>

<p>One day they came upon a group of poor, ragged creatures mending
the <a name="7">thing</a> they called a road:</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy10.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
13]</a></center>

<p>At last they arrived at the Valley of Holiness, a famous
pilgrimage resort with great monasteries and convents, and hermits
galore. The monks were in sore distress, for the holy fountain had
ceased flowing, and Merlin's most powerful magic failed to r estore
it.</p>

<center><b>So the Yankee Took a Hand,</b></center>

<p>and told Merlin that the best thing for him to do was to go home
and work the weather. "It was a home shot, and it made him wince;
for he was the worst weather-failure in the kingdom. Whenever he
ordered up the danger signals along the coast there wa s a week's
dead calm, sure, and every time he prophesied fair weather it
rained brick-bats. But I kept him in the weather bureau right
along, to undermine his reputation."</p>

<p>He then worked a modern miracle on the well with stunning
effect, sending to the factory and chemical laboratory at Camelot,
which had been left in charge of Clarence, for the materials in the
shape of lead pipe, a force pump with an electric apparatus and
fireworks to give eclat to the proceedings. The account of this
miracle is one of the most delicious things in the book, repairing
the well with the aid of his trained assistants from Camelot by
mending the leak which nobody had thought of looking f or, and,
when everything was ready, repeating some phenomenally long German
words by way of conjuration, accompanied by Bengal lights from the
chapel roof, touched off with an electric battery, and finally
turning on the water to the accompaniment of a gr and outburst of
rockets -- all of which pyrotechnics was taken to be the vomiting
of hell-fire by the infernal spirit that had enchanted the
well.</p>

<p>While he was here at the Valley of Holiness, a rival magician
arrived and everybody took stock in him because he claimed to be
able to tell what the Emperor of the East and other mighty and
distant potentates were doing at any moment. But the Yankee n
on-plussed him by asking him to tell what he, the Yankee, was doing
with his right hand! But the humbug pretended that such trifles
were beneath his dignity; enchanters of his degree deigned not to
concern themselves with the doings of any but kings, emp erors,
princes, them that be born in the purple, and them only, and he
volunteered to tell what King Arthur was doing. But the Yankee had
secretly established telephonic communication with Camelot, and
knew just what was really going on at the court, and prophesied
that the King and Queen, with their following, would arrive in the
valley the day after the next, at vespers, to pay pious homage to
the waters that had been restored.</p>

<center><b>The Telephone Kept Him Informed</b></center>

<p>of the royal progress, but he was surprised that in the valley
there was no sign of interest in the King's coming; there seemed to
be no preparations making to receive <a name="8">him in</a>
state.</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy11.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
24]</a></center>

<p>While the King is at the valley there is</p>

<center><b>A Competitive Examination</b></center>

<p>for positions in the new standing army just instituted, the
first regiment of which had just been formed. But the royal
preference is given to the young scions of the nobility over the
deserving cadets from the Yankee's recently instituted "West Point
." The latter, however, effects a happy compromise, by persuading
the King to make the 1st regiment the crack one, the "King's Own,"
officered entirely by the nobility, with possibly five times as
many officers as privates, so that it would be the heart' s desire
of the nobility, and leaving the rest of the standing army to be
made up out of common-place materials, and officered with nobodies,
as was proper -- "nobodies selected on the basis of mere
efficiency."</p>

<p>Another event is the arrival of the first newsboy with the
arrival of the new paper started under the management of Clarence,
the Camelot Weekly Hosannah and Literary Volcano, gotten up in the
regular Arkansas style. The following, from the department of
"Local Smoke and Cinders," is <a name="9">a sample</a> item:</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy12.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
26]</a></center>

<p>When the Yankee mentions his intentions to go out to scour the
country disguised as a petty freeman and familiarize himself with
the humbler life of the people, King Arthur is all on fire in a
minute with the novelty of the thing, and insists on taking a
chance in the adventure. So the two start out incognito, and the
relation of their experience gives a wonderful chance to describe
the customs and manners of the country in that age. He has a hard
time</p>

<center><b>Breaking in the King</b></center>

<p>so as to assume the requisite humility in the presence of the
gentry whom they meet on the way. On one occasion the King forgot
himself. Two knights rode toward them, and it would have fared ill
in consequence of the King's lack of proper deference h ad it not
been for a dynamite bomb which the Yankee had taken along to work a
miracle with in case of emergency. With this he blew up the knights
most effectively, but he had to explain to the King that "this was
a miracle of so rare a sort that it could n't be done except when
the atmospheric conditions were just right. Otherwise he would be
encoring it every time we had a good subject, and that would be
inconvenient, because I hadn't any more bombs along."</p>

<p>Here is a capital saying by the King, when the Yankee is
drilling him to walk like a lowly man, which is difficult, since
his shoulders have known no ignobler burden than iron mail, and
they <a name="10">will not</a> stoop:</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy13.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
28]</a></center>

<p>On this expedition the King is taught something of sympathy with
the common people by becoming familiar with their condition, though
it is a difficult lesson, that of bringing a man into touch with a
mode of life foreign to that in which he is born and reared. "He
could only see one side of it. He was born so, educated so; his
veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with this sort
of unconscious brutality." Finally, the Yankee and the King are</p>

<center><b>Made Captive and Sold as Slaves.</b></center>

<p>The slave market was utterly stagnant. The King of England
brought $7, and his prime minister $9. The King brooded; but not
about the prodigious nature of his fall; "what gravelled him most,
to start with, was not this, but <a name="11">the price</a> he had
fetched!"</p>

<center><a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/yankee/linkcy14.html">[EXCERPT FROM CHAPTER
35]</a></center>

<p>They have some exciting adventures, and are on the point of
being hanged when they are rescued by the timely arrival of
Launcelot and 200 mailed and belted knights on bicycles; Clarence
rides along with them and tells how he has had the boys practising
this long time, privately, and just hungry for a chance to show
off.</p>

<center><b>England Then Takes a Great Start,</b></center>

<p>and the modern inventions are brought out openly. Even base ball
is brought forward with the intention of replacing the tournament
with something that might furnish an escape for the extra steam of
the chivalry. The account of a base ball match, with the knights
playing in their armor, is funny enough. "When a man was running,
and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base, it was like
an ironclad coming into port."</p>

<p>The advance in the art of popular bookmaking in the past two
decades is illustrated by the contrast between <i>Innocents
Abroad</i> and this volume. In illustration, the progress is
particularly notable. Even a child of today would turn in contempt
from the crude woodcuts of the former to the beautiful pen-and-ink
drawings by Dan Beard that adorn the new work. These drawings are
graceful, picturesque and thoroughly characteristic of the spirit
of the book. Many of them embody instructive allegories, as, for
instance, in a cut of Justice, with her scales, one containing the
heavy hammer of "Labor" and the other the baubles of "Aristocracy,"
but the latter made to outweigh the former by means of the string
of "Self-interest," artfully attached to the toe of "Law," who
stands by; another, in a similar vein, shows the Justice of the
19th century and Justice of the sixth century standing opposite
each other, and simultaneously remarking, "Sister, your blind is
disarranged," for, with the same manner of string attached to the
toe of each, "Money" is made to outweigh "Labor" by the former,
just as titles are made heavier in the balance by the latter. One
little cut shows "Decorations of Sixth Century Aristocracy" as
"Rewards for all Babes Born Under Specified Conditions," such as
"Slave Driver," "Robber of Unarmed Savages," "Robber of Orphans,"
"Absorber of Taxes," "Murderer of Rivals," etc., the whole
supported by "Honi soit qui mal y pense!" Another illustrates the
remark of the king concerning a peasant: "Brother! to dirt like
this?" by depicting the three phases of oppression of man by man,
first by violence under the sword of royal power, then by the book
of "law," making man subject to the slave driver's lash, and last,
the subjection of the workingman to the millions of the monopolist.
A strong and spirited picture of an arrogant slave driver shows in
its face the unmistakable portrait of a celebrated American
billionaire and stock gambler.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to regard England of today as "essentially
a republic, with a monarchical head," that it seems strange that
the utterances of this book, so thoroughly in accordance with
accepted American ideas, should find any difficulty in obtaining
publicity in England, yet so strong is the prejudice there still
that its English publisher has cut out some of the best passages,
including a portion of the preface, with some persiflage about "the
divine right of kings."</p>
