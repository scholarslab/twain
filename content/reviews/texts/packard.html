<h2>Packard's Monthly [unsigned]<br>
1869: October</h2>

<p><i>The Innocents Abroad; or, The New Pilgrim's Progress,</i> is
the title of Mark Twain's latest appearance between covers. The
book is a ponderous one, containing over 650 pages, splendidly
illustrated, and produced in the best style of art by the American
Publishing Company, of Hartford. No ordinary "notice" can do
justice to this work. In the language of many others, "it must be
seen (and read) to be appreciated." It is a curious account of the
famous Quaker City pleasure trip to the Mediterranean and the Holy
Land, which was conceived by and executed under command of Captain
Duncan, in the summer of 1867. There were many intelligent
sight-seers among "the innocents"; but few, we are inclined to
believe, who got as much out of the trip as did the author of this
book. Mark Twain is a born journalist, besides being at the present
time first among American humorists. It is, indeed, doubtful if he
has ever had an equal; he certainly has not had in his line -- that
of dry, self-contained, unobtrusive and pervading fun. There is no
glare in his emanations -- no blinding coruscations of wit, which,
flashing suddenly upon you, as suddenly go out, leaving you in
darkness and uncertainty; no apparent striving after sharp effects;
no digging in poor soil for poorer puns. What is said is most
naturally said, and if there is humor in it, it is because the
writer could not express it otherwise. Whatever may be the quality
of the wine which fills your glass, you never feel that it is being
drawn from an empty cask, or that its flavor is at all dependent
upon the abundance of its supply. When Mr. Beecher was reprimanded
for saying so many funny things in the pulpit, he replied, "Oh, but
if you only knew the number of funny things I do not say!" And this
is the impression left upon the reader of Mark Twain. Whatever good
things he may choose to fasten with his pen, one cannot but feel
that his best things are yet untold. There is one species of poor
wit that Mark has not yet found it necessary to attempt, and we
trust he never will, and that is poor orthography and worse
grammar. It is not to be denied that a telling point may sometimes
be made by a violent assault upon the barriers of "good English."
Artemus Ward achieved some glory in this field; and his literary
successor, Josh Billings, sometimes unearths a nugget; but the game
thus far has not been worth the candle, and we doubt if it ever
will be. At all events, Mark Twain has no such weak necessity, and
we are glad of it. Some portions of the book are devoted to
correct, unexaggerated descriptions of the country, and matters
requiring historical accuracy; but there is no pretence, other than
of a humorous and extravagant account of a memorable voyage. There
will be those who will see in the descriptions of the Holy Land a
conspicuous lack of reverence for sacred associations, and the
contrast between this and ordinary guide-books will not need to be
pointed out; but the artistic and effectual disposal of the
romantic tales of tourists, which have enveloped these scenes with
a mysterious beauty and awe not to be penetrated or approached,
will be at least satisfactory to the matter-of-fact reader.</p>

<p>Here is his quiet style of getting down from a high state of
mental exhilaration to every-day considerations:</p>
