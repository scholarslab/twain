<h2><i>Speaker</i> [unsigned]<br>
 1890: January</h2>

<br>


<p>Mark Twain is also somewhat affected by the Spirit of his Time,
which is didactic; and by the Spirit of his Nation, which is
inventive, but not refined. Mr. Lewis Carroll is far beyond Mr.
Clemens in points of delicacy and taste; but it may be doubted
whether any English author of repute would have tried to win a
laugh by an irreverant treatment of the legend of the Holy Grail,
as Mr. Clemens has done in <i>A Yankee at the Court of King
Arthur</i>. It is quite certain that there are few English readers
who will care to see the subject begrimed with prime American
jests. Mr. Clemens used to be able to make us laugh without
resorting to this easy and distressing method; in his last book he
fails to make us laugh by any method, even the worst.</p>

<p>But Mr. Clemens is not only dull when he is offensive; he is
perhaps even more dull when he is didactic. His views on the
peerage, religious tolerance, republics, political economy, and the
application of electricity to warfare, may be -- some of them are
-- admirable. But they are out of place in a farcical book: the
satire is not fresh; the information is second-hand or inaccurate;
and the moral -- or immoral, as the case may be -- is clumsily
enforced and unduly prominent. Tediousness is still further ensured
by the length of the book. The joke is a long joke, and the author
has not "gompressed him." It would be idle to point out that the
book is not a sketch of the sixth century; because Mr. Clemens is
careful to remove by a prefatory note any such objection. But he
must not think that his confession of incompetence will make him
seem any the less incompetent to the intelligent reader.</p>

<p>The illustrations to the book are occasionally allegorical, and
remind us of the hieroglyphic which is to be found at the beginning
of prophetic almanacks. In one of them the root of a tree is marked
Religious Intolerence; but the artist spells quite as well as he
draws. They are very badly arranged; they seldom occur at the right
place; and they break into text, making the task of reading very
difficult. The task was hard enough, too, without that. We hope --
we may even believe -- that we have seen the artist at his worst;
we certainly have not seen the author at his best.</p>

<p>Sometimes we think that we shall never see the author at his
best again. American humour depended much upon quaint and happy
phrase. When these phrases are repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>, their
quaintness and happiness seem to disappear. But we have been
saddened and depressed by reading two long and humorous books, and
are, perhaps unduly inclined to be pessimistic. We had expected to
laugh a little; and, instead of that, we have learned much -- much
that we knew before. And, after all, it must be easy for Mr.
Clemens to do better; and we know why it must.</p>
