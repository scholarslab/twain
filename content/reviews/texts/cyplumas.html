<h2><i>Plumas National</i> [unsigned]<br>
 1890: July 5</h2>

<br>


<p>Mark Twain has never written anything brighter and wittier than
<i>A Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i>, his latest book, which is
now issued with all the advantages of illustrations that add zest
to the great humorist's fun and satire. The book is as able and
original as <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> or <i>Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn</i>, while it bids fair to be fully as popular
with the American public as either of these books. It is one long
satire on modern England and Englishmen, under the clever guise of
an attempt to picture the England of the sixth century and of
Arthurian legend. It is said that Mark wrote the story about seven
years ago, but about the time he had completed it he paid a visit
to England and was received so handsomely that he didn't have the
heart to print his bitter satire, that in places reminds one of
Swift. Mark Twain has come up from the people. He is American to
the backbone, and the assumption of natural superiority by titled
English aristocrats and the terrible wrongs inflicted on the
working people, evidently galled him beyond endurance. He has taken
his revenge in this volume, and a thorough going over it is, for he
has mercilessly flayed the follies, vices, cruelties and false
pretensions of English royalty and aristocracy.</p>

<p>A mere statement of the plot of the story shows the ample field
it gives for "most excellent fooling." Mark pretends to find a
Connecticut Yankee in London who recalls his experiences in the age
of King Arthur. The story is told with great realistic effect, and
the extraordinary contrasts of modern slang and archaic speech, of
nineteenth-century progress and sixth-century superstition, when
developed by a master of the art of humor, are inexpressibly droll.
The Yankee is captured by one of the Knights of the Round Table and
brought to the court, where he is about to be executed as a curious
monster, when he chances to remember that an eclipse occurs on that
day. So he adopts the device which Rider Haggard has used with so
much effect in his African romances, and threatens to destroy the
sun unless he is released. The sun's disk begins to be obscured and
before the eclipse is ended he has been made a great noble, Sir
Boss, with ample revenue, and the office of chief adviser of the
King. Then begin contests with jealous knights and especially bouts
of witchcraft with Merlin, in which the famous magician is
completely vanquished by modern science.</p>

<p>Mark's picture of the deficiencies of the Arthurian court in
little conveniences is very droll. "No soap, no matches, no looking
glass, except a metal one about as powerful as a pail of water, and
not a chromo. I had been used to chromos for years and I saw now
that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into
the fabric of my being and had become a part of me." And then the
makeshifts for light -- "a bronze dish half full of boarding-house
butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that
produced what is regarded as a light."</p>

<p>And here is the picture of the people of England at the time of
King Arthur, which, curiously enough, is as applicable to the great
body of Englishmen of to-day as to those of <a name="3">thirteen
centuries</a> ago:</p>

<p>These extracts give a fair idea of the sarcasm which the author
heaps upon England. He is in dead earnest when he gets to tilting
at the divine right of kings and aristocrats to make the people
slave and sweat blood for them, but he unbends when he deals with
chivalry. He has no more reverence for the beautiful legends which
Tennyson has embalmed in his <i>Idyles of the King</i> than Bob
Ingersoll has for St. Peter's or the best works of some of the old
masters. Some of his caricature is very funny, as, for instance,
this bit about the <a name="4">search for</a> the Holy Grail:</p>

<br>


<p>In the last chapters the author puts no bridle on his
extravagance, and the book ends in scenes of warfare that will make
Haggard green with envy. The illustrations by Dan Beard are full of
humor, and bring out the fun of the story. The book is finely
printed and bound and lavishly illustrated. For sale by
subscription only by A. L. Bancroft &amp; Co., 132 Post Street,
sole agents for the coast.</p>
