<b><font size="+1">MARK TWAIN.</font></b>
<br>
<br>
Mark Twain came in on the North West last evening and consequently
was about an hour late in arriving at the First Methodist church. A
hack was waiting at the dock and drove him as quickly as possible
to the church. He walked on the platform at about 9:10 o'clock and
calmly announced that it looked for a time as though he was to be
late but fortunately it was not so.

<p>Twain is a man of medium height and size with a rather calm and
serene looking countenance. He wears an iron grey moustache and a
bushy head of decidedly grey hair that makes one believe Twain is
trying to rival Paderewski. His style is rather original. He speaks
slowly with a peculiar drawl and gives one the idea that nothing on
earth could make him talk any faster.</p>

<p>As for the entertainment, however, it must be admitted that it
was disappointing. Perhaps expectations were raised too high. The
people started in to laugh at once as though they were there for
that purpose and thought they ought to. After he had narrated a
couple of his yarns, however, they subsided somewhat, and only
occasionally broke out again. Twain did not seem to be able to get
the audience under his control although he had the opportunity to
do it very easily at the beginning.</p>

<p>His entertainment is rather informal in style. He slides easily
from one story into another without much warning and introduces
anecdotes as they come to his mind. Some of them impress one as
being very funny, although all of them are of rather a <a name="a">
dry sort</a> of humor, but some others fall somewhat flat.</p>

HURRIED INVERVIEW ON DOCK<br>
At the Church a Big Audience Patiently Awaited His Arrival.</b><br>
<br>
 While the large audience waited for the coming of Mark Twain at
the First Methodist church, Deacon R.R. Briggs waited on the
Northern steamship dock, peering out seaward for a glimpse of the
big white ship and the delinquent lecturer.

<p>"There she comes! There she comes!" ejaculated Mr. Briggs, as he
hopped around on the dock, with smiling face.</p>

<p>"There's Maj. Pond," exclaimed the deacon, as the big vessel
neared the dock. Maj. Pond stood on the edge of the gangway,
peering onto the dock, and by his side, all dressed for the
platform, stood Mark Twain. Behind him stood Mrs. Clemens and Miss
Clemens.</p>

<p>"Here we are, Major!" shouted Deacon Briggs.</p>

<p>The boat's officers blew their whistles, shouted commands, and
in a moment the big vessel stood close to the dock. The gang plank
was run aboard. Purser Pierce stepped aside and off came big Maj.
Pond, chin whiskers, white straw hat, good natured countenance and
all. He was closely followed by Mark Twain and his family.</p>

<p>"Is there a carriage here?" queried the humorist.</p>

<p>"Right this way," replied Mr. Briggs, as he started across the
dock for a hack that stood in waiting at the corner.</p>

<p>Twain bustled along at the heels of the quick stepping deacon,
and his wife and daughter came along with Maj. Pond.</p>

<p>"Drive to the First Methodist church faster than you ever drove
before," ordered Mr. Briggs as he climbed nimbly onto the box with
the driver.</p>

<p>"I'll run 'em all the way," replied the Jehu.</p>

<p>The whip cracked, the horses sprang forward and the carriage
went whirling away at a furious pace.</p>

<b><font size="+1">MR. CLEMENS' LECTURE</font><br>
It Was Mostly Made Up of Readings and Very Funny Stories</b><br>
<br>
It was about 9 o'clock when the audience that filled the First
Methodist church heard the cry outside, "Here he comes," and
hundreds of expectant eyes turned toward the door through which the
famous humorist entered escorted by Rev. Dr. Thoburn. "It looked
for a time," said Mr. Clemens by way of introduction, "as if I
would be a few minutes late." Then he recited the story of the frog
jumping match, so familiar to all readers of his stories; told of
going to his father's doctor office one night after having played
truant and finding the body of a man who had been killed. Mark told
a story of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, followed by the ghost story,
which was related so artistically that the final "Wough!" brought
every one to his feet. There was also a story of a new clergyman at
a christening. The clergyman dilated at length on an excuse for the
small size of the little one whom he understood to be a boy. Ending
an eloquent peroration to the effect that the infant might prove a
modern Caeser or Hannibal, he asked abruptly, "But what is his
name?" "Name is it?" replied one of the company, "Why his name it
is Mary Ann."</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens and his party left last night for St. Paul, where he
lectures tonight.</p>
