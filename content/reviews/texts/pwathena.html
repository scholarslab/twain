<h2><i>Athenaeum</i> [unsigned]<br>
1895: January 19</h2>

<br>


<p>The best thing in <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, by Mark Twain
(Chatto &amp; Windus), is the picture of the negro slave Roxana,
the cause of all the trouble which gives scope to Mr. Wilson's
ingenious discovery about finger-marks. Her gusts of passion or of
despair, her vanity, her motherly love, and the glimpses of nobler
feelings that are occasionally seen in her elementary code of
morals, make her very human, and create a sympathy for her in spite
of her unscrupulous actions. But hers is the only character that is
really striking. Her son is a poor creature, as he is meant to be,
but he does not arrest the reader with the same unmistakable
reality: his actions are what might be expected, but his
conversations, especially with Wilson and the Twins, seem
artificial and forced. Wilson, the nominal hero, appears to most
advantage in the extracts from his calendar which head the
chapters, but as a personage he is rather too shadowy for a hero.
And what has to be said about the book must be chiefly about the
individuals in it, for the story in itself is not much credit to
Mark Twain's skill as a novelist. The idea of the change of babies
is happy, and the final trial scene is a good piece of effect; but
the story at times rambles on in an almost incomprehensible way.
Why drag in, for example, all the business about the election,
which is quite irrelevant? and the Twins altogether seem to have
very little <i>raison d'etre</i> in the book. Of course there are
some funny things in the story, it would not be by Mark Twain if
there were not, but the humour of the preface might very well be
spared; it is in bad taste. Still, if the preface be skipped the
book well repays reading just for the really excellent picture of
Roxana.</p>
