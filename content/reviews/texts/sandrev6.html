<h3>Mark Twain's Lecture.</h3>
</center>

We had not opportunity last week of speaking particularly of the
entertainment furnished by Mr. Twain in his lecture at Egberts'
Hall on Friday evening. It was altogether a novel production, so
different, in fact, from what people usually hear from the
platform, that the audience was somewhat disappointed; but quite
agreeably so, however, for all complained that the lecture was too
short, notwithstanding the speaker occupied a full hour in the
delivery of his queer, quaint and quizzical remarks. His
introduction of himself was remarkably Twain-ish and placed him and
his hearers upon good terms at once. He gave many interesting facts
concerning the Sandwich Islands, as well as funny incidents, and
droll experiences which were all jumbled together in a promiscuous
manner that was quite fascinating. From some of his best stories we
select the following which "brought down the house":

<p>He said that there was a sort of tradition or belief in the
Sandwich Islands, that every great and noted liar always brings up
there, in some time of his life. Of course, they stayed there for
good and did not come back delivering lectures. One of the greatest
of these was a man by the name of Morgan. After he died the natives
venerated his memory and recollected him with affection. Once when
he was asked if he had ever heard of the Natural Bridge of
Virginia, he answered. "Of course, didn't my father help to build
it?" Another time, when he was telling about a fast horse he once
owned, he said that, "In a thunder storm one day, he rode eighteen
miles without getting a drop of water on him, while his dog was
swimming along behind!"</p>

<p>One day, while the company were telling stories of mean men,
this Morgan capped the climax by telling about a corporation of
mean men. "This corporation were having some blasting done, and one
day, while one of the men was drilling away, he by chance struck a
spark, and the result was a premature blast which blew the man up
straight in the air. For a little while he appeared as large as a
man, then went up till he looked as large as a boy, then higher
till he looked like a doll, then till he looked as large as a bee,
and then out of sight. He soon came back again looking as large as
a bee, then down till he looked as large as a doll, nearer, till he
looked like a boy, then a man again, and came down with his crowbar
in precisely the same spot as before, and began drilling away. Now
this man was not gone more than fifteen minutes, and this
corporation of mean men <i>docked him for lost time!</i>"</p>

<p>We regret that so few were present at this and other lectures
given under the auspices of the Sons of Temperance and the "Grand
Army of the Republic." The gentlemen composing these associations
have, at great sacrifice of time and money, furnished our citizens
with quite as good a course of lectures as have been given in our
neighboring cities, yet we regret to say, they have as a whole,
been poorly patronized, and in many cases found fault with. Some
say, "why don't you get Beecher?" Others, "why don't you get Gough
or George W. Curtis?" We will answer for them. Mr. Beecher would
not come at any price, and the sum asked by Mr. Gough was entirely
beyond the possibility of raising even if the hall were filled at
fifty cents for each ticket, which, judging by past experience,
could not be done; for only a few seasons since, that celebrated
lecturer was advertised to speak in the M. E. Church, in behalf of
the temperance cause, at twenty-five cents admission, and the house
was not half filled,--a fact not at all creditable to our citizens.
George W. Curtis might be obtained if the people would come out;
but as in the case of Mr. Gough, the last time he appeared before a
Cohoes audience, the receipts failed to pay expenses, and the
association were compelled to make up the deficiency. This ought
not to be, for there is a sufficient number of intelligent people
in our large population to sustain one or even two courses of
lectures creditably, if not profitably to those who take the
trouble to secure them.</p>

<p>In closing, we will state that the Sons of temperance have
engaged George Francis Train, and the G. A. R. have made an
engagement with Dr. Hays, the celebrated Arctic explorer, and also
with Mr. J. Mines the editor of the Troy <i>Times</i>, to lecture
before our citizens in a short time, and we sincerely hope that
they may have an audience, not only commensurate with their
reputation and talents as lecturers, but that the associations
under whose auspices they are to appear, may, to some extent, at
least, be reimbursed for the losses they have sustained on former
occasions.</p>
