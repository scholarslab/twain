<p>M<font size=-1>ARK</font> T<font size=-1>WAIN'S</font> lecture drew a large audience, though on a stormy night.  We regret to add that the listeners were generally disappointed.  The speaker announced that he was tired of the Ward lecture, and had just compiled a new one from his forthcoming book.  The result was a hash of anecdotes, jokes and descriptions which would have been considered good as part of a well arranged lecture, but made themselves rather thin diet for an evening's entertainment.  Mr. Clemens is a writer of ability, his published work shows that; and his lecture here two years ago was very satisfactory.  In appearing this season with such evident lack of careful preparation, making a tour "on his reputation," as the showmen say, he does injustice both to himself and the societies employing him.</p>
