<p><i>A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</i>, by Mark Twain
(Samuel L. Clemens), published by Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus, is a
rather laborious piece of fun with a sort of purpose in it. One of
the illustrations, early in the volume, represents a Yankee
tickling with a straw the nose of a gigantic statue of a lion, and
indicates the general nature of the serious purport of the 525
pages of that very American kind of American humour of which "Mark
Twain" is the chief master. Laughing at British institutions, and
showing that the good old times were uncommonly bad times for the
people, and that not a few of the historical privileges which still
exist do not suit the ideas of the great republic of the West,
afford a good deal of harmless amusement and opportunities for very
trite comment. It is a mistake to decide that ridicule cast upon
the story of Arthur is an offence in any way other than in the
matter of taste in jokes. Sir Thomas Malory and Lord Tennyson will
survive. Masterpieces will stand any amount of parody. "The Burial
of Sir John Moore" and Gray's "Elegy" are just as impressive and
admirable as if they had not been parodied with all sorts of
jocularity and ribaldry scores of times. One may easily read Mark
Twain's book without any ill will; but it is a harder task to read
it with sustained merriment. By writing so much the author has
shown how mechanical his method really is, and, with all respect
for the cleverness of the writers of Gaiety burlesques, one doubts
if anybody could be amused by reading one of them if it ran to five
hundred pages. That is, however, the sort of task which Mark Twain
offers to his readers. One may be pardoned for confessing that the
task has proved too severe. A trial of several chapters taken at
random shows that the author is still as fresh as ever in his racy
contrasts between things ancient and modern, and as quaint in his
droll expressions. He can raise a laugh once, twice, or even twenty
times, but not a thousand.</p>
