 <b><font size="+1">NINETY MINUTES WITH MARK TWAIN</font><br>
The Audience Thoroughly Enjoyed Their Evening With the
Humorist.</b><br>
<br>
 So many of the Spokane people are now camping out that the most
intelligent and highly appreciative audience which assembled to
hear Mark Twain last evening was not so large as it should have
been. All present thoroughly enjoyed their 90 minutes with the
greatest of American humorists, from their first smile at "a day
which was not good -- for school" to their nervous start at the
"ough" which ended the old negro's ghost story and the evening's
entertainment.

<p>Samuel L. Clemens, who for nearly a generation has been
considered the typical and most successful humorist of America, is
of medium height, sleight rather than portly, but his eagle face,
in its wavy mane of gray hair, is very striking. His slow drawl and
peculiarly dry manner are thoroughly natural to him, and were as
markedly his own when he lectured on the Sandwich Islands in the
60's.</p>

<p>He entertainment consists of the retelling of a number of the
most famous stories from his books, with a background of amusing
comment.</p>

<p>He told about his first fight; "The Jumping Frog," his first hit
in literature, the maundering ram story from "Roughing It," Huck
Finn's runaway trip, "An Early Transgression," in which he depicted
his juvenile remorse after stealing a green watermelon, the horrors
of the German language, and finally the ghost story of "The Golden
Arm."</p>

<p>Mark Twain's quaint and original humor delighted his hearers,
and the underlying stratum of pathos and serious thought, without
which humor becomes verbal horseplay, was as highly
appreciated.</p>
