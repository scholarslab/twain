<h2><i>Saturday Review</i> [unsigned]<br>
1894: December 29</h2>

<p>Mark Twain's last book is a story of mixed babies and the
ingenious detection of crime. It is not altogether another <i>
Huckleberry Finn</i>. On the other hand, it is a relief to find
that it is not another <i>Yankee at King Arthur's Court</i>. Roxy,
the slave woman, who changes the babies, is a delightful character,
who stirs us with a warm and ready interest. For the rest, there is
little that can be said to rouse enthusiasm. Pudd'nhead Wilson
himself is a little unreal, too much of the <i>deus ex machina</i>,
though there is much that is Twainian in the specimen sayings that
illustrate his wisdom. Every chapter is headed with these extracts,
and it is clear that Pudd'nhead Wilson is to Mark Twain what Poor
Richard was to Franklin. In the means by which Wilson detects the
murderer of Judge Driscoll we have an ingenious adaptation of the
system of thumb-impressions, originated by Sir W. Herschell in
India, as a method of identifying criminals. It is cleverly, if not
entirely persuasively, worked out in the story. But the sketch of
Roxy, the negress, is by far the finest thing in the book.</p>
