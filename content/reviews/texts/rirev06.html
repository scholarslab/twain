<center><font size=+1>Mark Twain's New Book</font></center>
<p>The country reasonably and rightfully expects to be amused when Mr. Samuel
  Clemens gives it a new volume.  His fun is contagious.  He carries his personal manner
  into his writing, and is our most mirth-provoking story teller.  His very deliberation,
  leisure and particularity, has come to be the known prologue to a hearty laugh.  His fun is
  based on good sense.  Behind the mask of the story-teller is the satirist, whose head is
  always clear, who is not imposed on by shams, who hates all pretension, and who uses his
  humor, which is often extravagant, to make pretension and false dignity ridiculous.</p>
  <p>It is not mere accident that everybody likes to read this author's stories and sketches;
  it is not mere accident that they are interesting reading.  His style is singularly lucid,
  unambiguous and strong.  Its simplicity is good art.  The reader may not be conscious that
  there is any art about it, but there is art in its very perspicuity.  There is no
  circumlocution, or any attempt at fine writing, but there is a use of vigorous English, and
  often a quaint use of it that gives the effect of humor in the soberest narration.</p>
  <p>The author also means to be true to his art in another respect, and that is to report the
  odd characters he meets and the people of the new countries he describes, exactly as they
  were, slang and all.  There is much slang in the book, but it is the <i>argot</i> that was current in the mining regions, and the description of
  the life there would be entirely imperfect if it had been left out.</p>
  <p><i>Roughing It</i> is a volume of nearly 600 pages, of queer
  stories, funny dialogues, strange, comical and dangerous adventures, and it is a book of
  humor first of all; but we are inclined to think that, on the whole, it contains the best
  picture of frontier mining life that has even been written.  The episode of the silver
  mining in Nevada has certainly never been so graphically described.  It is an experience
  that can, we trust, never be repeated on this continent.  In these pages we are made to see
  distinctly a society that never had any parallel.  It would be unpleasant to read about it, if
  the author did not constantly relieve the dreadful picture with stokes of humor.</p>
  <p>The book contains the varied experience of the author for seven years.  He left St.
  Louis, a boy, in company with his brother who had been appointed secretary of Nevada;
  he desbribes the overland stage trip at length, a short sojourn in the Mormon city, a life of
  several years in Carson and Virginia city, and in other mining regions.  As a miner and
  newpaper reporter he experienced all the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and temporary
  wealth.  The story of his being worth a million at one time, and losing his wealth by the
  neglect of his partner to do the amount of work required by law to hold the claim, is
  literally true.  The book introduces us to San Fransisco life at that period, and the author's
  adventures there as editor and lecturer, and gives us his six months luxurious idling in the
  Sandwich Islands.  The seven years are crowded full of adventures and vicissitudes of
  good luck, poverty, suffering and enjoyment such as rarely come into one life.</p>
  <p>It is difficult to decide what to quote from the book, which is full of so much that is
  quotable, and our space will not permit us to give at length any of the stories of the
  strange adventures.  The ride in the overland mail coach is very graphically described, and
  enlivened by such <a name="b">observations</a> as this:--</a></p>

<blockquote>Fifty-two miles futher on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met sixty United States
  soldiers from Camp Floyd.  The day before, they had fired upon three hundred or four
  hundred Indians, whom they supposed gathered together for no good purpose.  In the fight
  that had ensued, four Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but
  nobody killed.  This looked like business.  We had a notion to get out and join sixty
  soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four hundred of the Indians, we concluded to
  go on and join the Indians.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The cayote is a living, breathing 
allegory of Want.  He is <i>always</i> 
 hungry.  He is always poor, out of luck and friendless.  The meanest 
creatures despise him, and even the fleas would desert him for a 
velocipede.  He is so spiritless and cowardly that even while his 
exposed teeth are pretending a threat, the rest of his face is 
apologizing for it.  And he is <i>so</i> 
 homely!--so scrawny, and ribby, and coarse-haired, and pitiful.  
When he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out, 
and then turns a little out of the course he was pursuing, depresses 
his head a bit, and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the 
sage-brush, glancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, 
till he is about out of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes 
a deliberate survey of you; he will trot fifty yards and stop 
again--another fifty and stop again; and finally the gray of his 
gliding body blends with the gray of the sage-brush, and he 
disappears.  All this is when you make no demonstration against 
him; but if you do, he develops a livelier interest in his journey, 
and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a deal of real estate 
between himself and your weapon, that by the time you have 
raised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle, and by the  
time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon, and by the 
time you have "drawn a bead" on him you see well enough that 
nothing but an unusually long-winded streak of lightning could 
reach him where he is now.  But if you start a swift-footed dog 
after him, you will enjoy it ever so much--especially if it is a dog 
that has a good opinion of himself, and has been brought up to 
think he knows something about speed.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>The cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of 
his, and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his 
shoulder that will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and 
worldly ambition, and make him lay his head still lower to the 
ground, and stretch his neck further to the front, and pant more 
fiercely, and stick his tail out straighter behind, and move his 
furious legs with a yet wilder frenzy, and leave a broader and 
broader, and higher and denser cloud of desert sand smoking 
behind, and marking his long wake across the level plain!  And all 
this time the dog is only a short twenty feet behind the cayote, and 
to save the soul of him he cannot understand why it is that he 
cannot get perceptibly closer; and he begins to get aggravated, and 
it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the cayote 
glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he 
grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has 
been taken in by an entire stranger, and what an ignoble swindle 
that long, calm, soft-footed trot is; and next he notices that he 
is getting fagged, and that the cayote actually has to slacken speed 
a little to keep from running away from him--and <i>then</i> 
 that town-dog is mad in earnest, and he begins to strain and weep 
and swear, and paw the sand higher than ever, and reach for the 
cayote with concentrated and desperate energy.  This "spurt" finds 
him six feet behind the gliding enemy, and two miles from his 
friends.  And then, in the instant that a wild new hope is lighting 
up his face, the cayote turns and smiles blandly upon him once 
more, and with a something about it which seems to say: "Well, I 
shall have to tear myself away from you, bub--business is business, 
and it will not do for me to be fooling along this way all day"--and 
forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the sudden splitting of a 
long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that dog is solitary 
and alone in the midst of a vast solitude!</blockquote> 
 
<blockquote>It makes his head swim.  He stops, and looks all around; 
climbs the nearest sand-mound, and gazes into the distance; shakes 
his head reflectively, and then, without a word, he turns and jogs 
along back to his train, and takes up a humble position under the 
hindmost wagon, and feels unspeakably mean, and looks ashamed, 
and hangs his tail at half-mast for a week.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Such of the Goshoots as 
we saw, along the road and hanging about the stations, were small, 
lean, "scrawny" creatures; in complexion a dull black like the 
ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt which 
they had been hoarding and accumulating for months, years, and 
even generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a silent, 
sneaking, treacherous looking race; taking note of everything, 
covertly, like all the other "Noble Red Men" that we (do not) read 
about, and betraying no sign in their countenances; indolent, 
everlastingly patient and tireless, like all other Indians; prideless 
beggars--for if the beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would not "go," any more 
than a clock without a pendulum; hungry, always hungry, and yet 
never refusing anything that a hog would eat, though often eating 
what a hog would decline; hunters, but having no higher ambition 
than to kill and eat jack-ass rabbits,  
crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from the buzzards 
and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have the common 
Indian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost 
amounts to emotion, thinking whiskey is referred to; a thin, 
scattering race of almost naked black children, these Goshoots are, 
who produce nothing at all, and have no villages, and no 
gatherings together into strictly defined trival communities--a 
people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep off a 
portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky, 
wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can 
exhibit.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended 
from the self-same gorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever 
animal-Adam the Darwinians trace them to.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the 
Goshoots, and yet they used to live off the offal and refuse of the 
stations a few months and then come some dark night when no 
mischief was expected, and burn down the buildings and kill the 
men from ambush as they rushed out.  And once, in the night, they 
attacked the stage-coach when a District Judge, of Nevada 
Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first volley of 
arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains, 
wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver.  The 
latter was full of pluck, and so was his passenger.  At the driver's 
call Judge Mott swung himself out, clambered to the box and 
seized the reins of the team, and away they plunged, through the 
racing mob of skeletons and under a hurtling storm of missiles.  
The stricken driver had sunk down on the boot as soon as he was 
wounded, but had held on to the reins and said he would manage 
to keep hold of them until relieved.</blockquote> 

<blockquote>And after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with 
his head between Judge Mott's feet, and tranquilly gave directions 
about the road; he said he believed he could live till the miscreants 
were outrun and left behind, and that if he managed that, the main 
difficulty would be at an end, and then if the Judge drove so and so 
(giving directions about bad places in the road, and general course) 
he would reach the next station without trouble.  The Judge 
distanced the enemy and at last rattled up to the station and knew 
that the night's perils were done; but  
there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the 
soldierly driver was dead.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the 
Overland drivers, now.  The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, 
a disciple of Cooper and a worshipper of the Red Man--even of the 
scholarly savages in the "Last of the Mohicans" who are fittingly 
associated with backwoodsmen who divide each sentence into two 
equal parts: one part critically grammatical, refined and choice of 
language, and the other part just such an attempt to talk like a 
hunter or a mountaineer, as a Broadway clerk might make after 
eating an edition of Emerson Bennett's works and studying frontier 
life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks--I say that the nausea 
which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian worshipper, set me to 
examining authorities, to see if perchance I had been 
over-estimating the Red Man while viewing him through the 
mellow moonshine of romance.  The revelations that came were 
disenchanting.  It was curious to see how quickly the paint and 
tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous, filthy and 
repulsive--and how quickly the evidences accumulated that 
wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only found Goshoots 
more or less modified by circumstances and surroundings--but 
Goshoots, after all.  They deserve pity, poor creatures; and they 
can have mine--at this distance.  Nearer by, they never get 
anybody's.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our 
necks and watching for the "pony-rider"--the fleet messenger who 
sped across the continent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying 
letters nineteen hundred miles in eight days!  Think of that for 
perishable horse and human flesh and blood to do!  The pony-rider 
was usually a little bit of a man, brimful of spirit and endurance.  
No matter what time of the day or night his watch came on, and no 
matter whether it was winter or summer, raining, snowing, hailing, 
or sleeting, or whether his "beat" was a level straight road or a 
crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices, or whether it led 
through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with hostile 
Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be off 
like the wind!  There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty.  
He rode fifty miles without stopping, by daylight, moonlight, 
starlight, or through the blackness of darkness--just as it happened.  
He rode a splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and 
lodged like a gentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten 
miles, and then, as he came crashing up to the station where stood 
two men holding fast a fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider 
and mail-bag was made in the twinkling of an eye, and away flew 
the eager pair and were out of sight before the spectator could get 
hardly the ghost of a look.  Both rider and horse went "flying 
light."  The rider's dress was thin, and fitted close; he wore a 
"round-about," and a skull-cap, and tucked his pantaloons into his 
boot-tops like a race-rider.  He carried no arms--he carried nothing 
that was not absolutely necessary, for even the postage on his 
literary freight was worth <i">five dollars a letter</i>.  He got but little frivolous correspondence to carry--his bag had 
business letters in it, mostly.  His horse was stripped of all 
unnecessary weight, too.  He wore a little wafer of a racing-saddle, 
and no visible blanket.  He wore light shoes, or none at all.  The 
little flat mail-pockets strapped under the rider's thighs would each 
hold about the bulk of a child's primer.  They held many and many 
an important business chapter and newspaper letter, but these were 
written on paper as airy and thin as gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk 
and weight were economized.  The stage-coach traveled about a 
hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles a day (twenty-four 
hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty.  There were 
about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night and day, 
stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to 
California, forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and 
among them making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring 
livelihood and see a deal of scenery every single day in the 
year.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a 
pony-rider, but somehow or other all that passed us and all that 
met us managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a 
whiz and a hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was gone 
before we could get our heads out of the windows.  But now we 
were expecting one along every moment, and would see him in 
broad daylight.  Presently the driver exclaims:</blockquote> 
<blockquote>"HERE HE COMES!"</blockquote> 
<blockquote>Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained 
wider.  Away across the endless dead level of the prairie a black 
speck appears against the sky, and it is plain that it moves.  Well, I 
should think so!  
In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling, 
rising and falling--sweeping toward us nearer and nearer--growing 
more and more distinct, more and more sharply defined--nearer 
and still nearer, and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the 
ear--another instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a 
wave of the rider's hand, but no reply, and man and horse burst 
past our excited faces, and go winging away like a belated 
fragment of a storm!</blockquote> 
<blockquote>So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but 
for the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a 
mail-sack after the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we 
might have doubted whether we had seen any actual horse and 
man at all, maybe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We were introduced to several citizens, at the stage office and on the way up to the
  governor's from the hotel--among others, to a Mr. Harris, who was on horseback: he
  began to say something, but interrupted himself with the remark:--</p>
  <p>"I'll have to get you to excuse me a minute; yonder is the witness that swore I helped
  to rob the California coach--a piece of impertinent intermeddling, sir, for I am not even
  acquainted with the man."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Then he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter, and the
  stranger began to explain with another.  When the pistols were emptied, the stranger
  resumed his work (mending a whip-lash), and Mr. Harris rode by with a polite nod,
  homeward bound, with a bullet through one of his lungs, and several in his hips; and from
  them issued little rivulets of blood that<pb n="102">coursed down the horse's sides and
  made the animal look quite picturesque.  I never saw Harris shoot a man after that but it
  recalled to mind that first day in Carson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Johnny K-- and I devoted our time to amusement.  He was the young son of 
an Ohio nabob and was out there for recreation.  He got it.  We had 
heard a world of talk about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe, 
and finally curiosity drove us thither to see it.  Three or four 
members of the Brigade had been there and located some timber 
lands on its shores and stored up a quantity of provisions in their 
camp.  We strapped a couple of blankets on our shoulders and took 
an axe apiece and started--for we intended to take up a wood ranch 
or so ourselves and become wealthy.  We were on foot.  The 
reader will find it advantageous to go horseback.  We were told 
that the distance was eleven miles. 
We tramped a long time on level ground, and then toiled 
laboriously up a mountain about a thousand miles high and looked 
over.  No lake there.  We descended on the other side, crossed the 
valley and toiled up another mountain three or four thousand miles 
high, apparently, and looked over again.  No lake yet.  We sat 
down tired and perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to 
curse those people who had beguiled us.  Thus refreshed, we 
presently resumed the march with renewed vigor and  
determination.  We plodded on, two or three hours longer, and at 
last the Lake burst upon us--a noble sheet of blue water lifted six 
thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and walled 
in by a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full 
three thousand feet higher still!  It was a vast oval, and one would 
have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling around 
it.  As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly 
photographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the 
fairest picture the whole earth affords.</blockquote> 

<blockquote>We found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys, and 
without loss of time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward 
the landmarks that signified the locality of the camp.  I got Johnny 
to row--not because I mind exertion myself, but because it makes 
me sick to ride backwards when I am at work.  But I steered.  A 
three-mile pull brought us to the camp just as the night fell, and we 
stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly hungry.  In a "cache" 
among the rocks we found the provisions and the cooking utensils, 
and then, all fatigued as I was, I sat down on a boulder and 
superintended while Johnny gathered wood and cooked supper.  
Many a man who had gone through what I had, would have wanted 
to rest.</blockquote>
