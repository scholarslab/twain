<br>
 If Mark Twain is the representative American humorist American
humor is rather a sorry product. That he is funny no one can deny;
that his exaggerations are grotesque is also true; but that his wit
is brilliant or his humor suggestive cannot be truly claimed. His
fun leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. It is like
machine work. Take his story of the theft of the watermelon. There
is hardly an incident in every day life that could not be made
amusing if told as he told that story. The fun of that story
consisted in the way it was told, not in the story itself. That is,
it depended upon the tricks of the comedian, not upon the wit or
humor underlying the thought. His sketch of Huck Finn and Nigger
Jim was very different. Here the basal idea was the struggle
between "a good heart and a half-educated conscience," and it was
admirably brought out. The sketch of the night spent in his
father's office with the corpse was neither funny nor gruesome. It
would have been intolerable if it were not for a few cute
expressions, such as: "I took the sash out of the window with me. I
did not really want the sash," and so on. Deprived of these it was
simply a good story, badly told. Mr. Clement's [sic] studied
awkwardness of manner helps what he says wonderfully, and his
peculiar tone of voice is a potent adjunct to his fun. The audience
was greatly amused, but it is also true that they were somewhat
disappointed. Mark Twain can tell a story very much better than
most men; he can see the droll aspect of things as few others can;
but he has little creative genius. His <a name="a">published
works</a> show that.

 <b><font size="+2">A CONTINUOUS LAUGH</font><br>
<font size="+1">Mark Twain Again Proves His Greatness as a
Humorist.</font><br>
FLOWING STREAM OF DROLLERY</b><br>
<br>
 There is but one Mark Twain. He is not classic, and he is just as
far from being conventional; but people like him and listen to him
all the more because he is himself. Last night at the Seattle
theater a crowded audience heard him for an hour and a half with
unwearying enjoyment as he gave one of those strange medleys of
humor and philosophy which have so much the sound of a great
literary improvisation. To tell the story of such a lecture is like
trying to narrate a laugh. Those who heard it enjoyed it, and those
who did not cannot conceive of it.

<p>The string on which the great humorist strung the many anecdotes
and jests that made up the body of the evening's entertainment was
a pretended moral lecture, which he said he had in mind to work out
at his leisure. Thus he would tell some droll story and draw
therefrom some far-fetched moral, which found its chief pith and
merit in being far-fetched. The following will serve as a poor
sample of a dozen of its kind:</p>

<p><img src="wrldpic4.GIF" align="left"> "When I was a boy my
father lived in a little Missouri village on the banks of the
Mississippi river. The place was so small that it was necessary for
one man to hold several such offices as coroner, mayor, postmaster,
in order to maintain the dignity of each. My father was the
incumbent. He had a small office built wherein his numerous
functions were discharged. It was not often that he got to act as
coroner, but now and then the community furnished a corpse. In the
office was a sofa, which was to me a very useful article of
furniture. We boys were told not to go fishing. For that reason we
went. On returning from one of these excursions, I did not care to
go at once into the home circle. I preferred letting the home
atmosphere cool down till next morning. Accordingly I would creep
into that office and use that sofa as a bed.</p>

<p>"One day there had been a fight in the village while I was out
fishing. One man had killed another with a bowie knife. The corpse
had been stripped to the waist and laid out on the floor of the
little office ready for the inquest next morning. Late at night I
came in, ignorant of what had occurred. I crept to the sofa was
just sinking into the deep, sweet sleep which is the reward of
honest toil when a strange feeling came over me as I thought I saw
some uncanny object on the floor. I first resolve to feel it, but
concluded I would wait. Just beyond it were some squares of
moonlight on the floor and I decided to wait till the moonlight
crept along to where the thing lay. Only those who have waited for
the moon at midnight know how slow it is. At last there lay a
pallid human hand in the ghostly light. I tried to turn over and
count a thousand till the moon should reveal what I knew now was
there, but I got no further than seventy-five. After what seemed an
interminable time, the white, muscular arm, then the rigid, set
face, then the body with the knife wound on the left side came into
view. I went away from there. I do not mean to imply that I left
hurriedly. I simply went. I went through the window. I took the
sash along with me. I did not have any special use for the sash,
but under the circumstances it was easier to take it than it was to
leave it.</p>

<p>"Now, in planning my great lecture on morals, I mean to
introduce this story to illustrate the principle that early in life
a young man should certainly gauge his limitations. He should know
just exactly how brave he is, how far he can rely on his own
courage before he is compelled to begin to use his discretion."</p>

<p>In similar vein the lecturer gave the story of the bucking horse
from his "Roughing It," which he said he proposed to use in his
great lecture "to show that we should be careful how we make the
acquaintance of strangers." Then he shot off at a merry tangent to
say that Mount Ranier had been pursuing this policy toward him
during his first visit. To illustrate the moral that conclusions
must not be drawn hastily, the gave the story of the preacher's
long baptismal harangue over what he supposed to be a boy baby,
till the name of Mary Ann was announced. In much the same tone
followed the story of the grandfather and the ram, and of Jim and
Huckleberry Finn when these two worthies were running away, and of
"My first theft."</p>

<p>Leaving this hypothetical lecture on morals, Mr. Clemens was
proceeding to give the substance of his famous essay on the German
language, when a rough voice from the gallery cried out: "Haf you
been to Heidelberg?" "Yes," retorted the lecturer, with ready wit;
"I studied German there and I learned many other things there also,
among them how to drink beer." The questioner subsided.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, Mr. Clemens gave his famous ghost story. It was
the strongest piece given by him, or rather, he gave it most
strongly, and when the unexpected denouement was reached there was
many a sudden jump among those who had been betrayed into
breathless expectancy through the weird magic of the well-told
dialect story.</p>

<p>As a mark of honor Mr. Clemens was called before the curtain,
and in response he gave "The Stammerer" in mirth-provoking
style.</p>

<p>Among those who occupied boxes were the members of the Torbert
Concert company, who appear at the Seattle theater on Saturday
night. Major Pond speaks in the highest terms of this company, Miss
Torbert being, in fact, a protoge of his, his first appearance with
her dating from her membership in Beecher's church.</p>
