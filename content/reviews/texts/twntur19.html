<br>
 Mark Twain's characteristic introduction of himself last night at
its close shaped itself into an apology for his having been the
cause of bringing from pleasant homes and cheerful firesides the
large audience that assembled at the opera house last night. We
venture the assertion, however, that every one present felt fully
repaid for the discomfort experienced in fighting their way through
the fiercest snow storm of the season by the excellence of the
entertainment furnished them by Mark Twain who certainly is
entitled to rank as our foremost humorist and George W. Cable, the
distinguished southern novelist. Mr. Cable was first upon the
program and gave a reading from Dr. Sevier, but unfortunately the
greatest portion of it was lost to the audience by reason of the
interruptions caused by the late comers. Mark Twain came next and
the appearance of the ungainly body and the shaggy head was the
signal for applause. He remarked after the performance that he had
grown handsomer of late. If this is the fact, and it is generally
understood that Twain is truthful, we feel grateful that he didn't
appear before us in his previous condition. As far as looks are
concerned Twain would never capture a premium at a beauty show, but
when it comes to story telling the best judges would pronounce him
chief. He called the audience friends and fellow townsmen, told
them he was glad to resume an intercourse that had been broken off
years ago, said he was sorry to have been the cause of bringing
them out upon such a night, but that they were no worse off than
the people of some seventy-five cities already visited by them this
season, that a storm generally preceded their coming, and that if
feeling well they always left a famine behind them. After this, as
a sort of introduction and preliminary, he waded into an extract
from his new book and caused many a laugh by his funny description
of the discussion of the merits of and demerits of "King Sollermun"
between the darkey Jim and Huckleberry Finn.

<p>Mr. Cable's next reading was from Dr. Sevier also and dealt with
Kate Riley, Richling and Ristofalo, the latter part of it being
devoted to the wooing of the widow by the Italian and was given in
a decidedly clever manner. Mark Twain then convulsed the audience
with a side-splitting history of his tussle with the German
language and his lamentable failure to properly declare their
adjectives or master the intricacies of the gender of their nouns.
Being recalled he told his very funny stuttering story and another
being demanded he spun a sailor yarn to the entire satisfaction of
the audience.</p>

<p>For the regular number on the program Mr. Cable at this point
substituted several pleasing Creole songs which were well received.
Twain then gave "a Trying Situation" which was followed by Mr.
Cable in a descriptive reading. He had kept his best for the last
and his dramatic rendition of "Mary's Night Ride" won for him most
heart applause. The performance was closed with a personal
reminiscence by Mark Twain detailing his experience with the duello
in his days of roughing it in the rowdy west.</p>
