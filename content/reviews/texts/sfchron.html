<p>"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" must be pronounced the most
amusing book Mark Twain has written for years. It is a more minute
and faithful picture of Southwestern manners and customs fifty
years ago than was "Life on the Mississippi," while in regard to
the dialect it surpasses any of the author's previous stories in
the command of the half-dozen species of patois which passed for
the English language in old Missouri. Mark Twain may be called the
Edison of our literature. There is no limit to his inventive
genius, and the best proof of its range and originality is found in
this book, in which the reader's interest is so strongly enlisted
in the fortunes of two boys and a runaway negro that he follows
their adventures with keen curiosity, although his common sense
tells him that the incidents are as absurd and fantastic in many
was as the "Arabian Nights." Here is where the genius and the human
nature of the author come in. Nothing else can explain such a <i>
tour de force</i> as this, in which the most unlikely materials are
transmuted into a work of literary art. The plot is extremely
simple. Huckleberry Finn, who appeared incidentally in the
veracious adventuers of Tom Sawyer, concludes to go down the
Mississippi to get rid of his drunken father. He falls in with a
runaway negro, and the book is given up to the adventures of this
couple on a raft on the river, re-enforced by two sharpers known as
the Duke and the King, and afterward by Tom Sawyer. In many parts
of the book, but especially at the outset, some of the
conversations are unnecessarily spun out, on the style of the elder
Dumas when he was writing at so much the word, but when the story
gets under good headway it is remarkably well proportioned, and the
interest is never allowed to flag for a moment. The very best
episodes are those which detail the swindling schemes of the two
river sharpers, who impose upon Huckleberry and the negro by
declaring that they are scions of royalty. These chapters were
printed in the <i>Century</i> under the title of "Royalty on the
Mississippi," but they left the fate of the two heroes in doubt, so
that most readers of the performances of the "Royal Nonesuch," and
the personation of the two brothers from England will want to know
what was the final result of their schemes.</p>

<p>The incidental descriptions of character are always good. Take,
for instance, this small picture of Huck's father--a typical Pike
county drunkard:</p>

<p>He was most 50, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled
and greasy and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining
through it like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so
was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no colorin his face,
where his face showed--it was white; not like another man's white,
but a white to make a body sick, a whote to make a body's flesh
crawl--a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his
clothes--just rags, that was all.</p>

<p>On the raft, while floating down the Mississippi, Huck has an
excellent opportunity to exercise his gift for lying. This is
simply phenomenal. The boy enjoys mendacity; he lies for the mere
lust of lying, and the ingenuity with which he piles one fiction on
top of another will excite the reader's wonder and admiration. Just
before the runaways get fairly started, Huck visits a neighboring
town to get information and encounters a farmer's wife. He is
dressed up in an old calico gown and pretends to be a girl
searching for her relations. The woman suspects his sex and tries
various devices to ascertain if her suspicions are true. Among
these is threading a needle and throwing a bar of lead at the rats
which swarm around the house. Finally she makes Huck own up that he
is a boy, and then gives him this sound advice in regard to
personating a girl:</p>

<p>"Don't you go about women in that old calico. You do a girl
tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child,
when you set out to thread a needle, don't hold the thread still
and fetch the needle up to it. Hold the needle still and poke the
thread at it--that's the way a woman most always does, but a man
always does 'tother way. And when you throw at a rat or anything
hitch yourself up a-tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as
awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot.
Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there
for it to turn on--like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with
your arm out to one side, like a boy. And mind you, when a girl
tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she
don't clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump
of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the
needle, and I contrived the other things just to make certain."</p>

<p>Some of the most succulent humor is connected with the swindling
exploits of the Duke and the King, who "work" the towns along the
bank and make considerable money. Their crowning work was in
playing the role of the English heirs of old Peter Wilks, a moneyed
resident of one of the river towns, who had just died. In the
construction of this plot Mark Twain surpasses himself and the
amount of really plausible lies which he manages to dovetail
together is something extraordinary. A half-dozen times the
adventurers are on the eve of exposure, but their fertility and
luck save them. Space is lacking to do more than give one extract
from this episode, which is a story in itself, descriptive of the
Arkansas undertaker at the funeral of old Peter:</p>

<p>When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in
his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the
last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and
comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke;
he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up
passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then
he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest,
glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more
smile to him than there is to a ham.</p>

<p>They had borrowed a melodeum -- a sick one; and when everything
was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty
skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter
was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion.
Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to
talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the
cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most
powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had
to stand there, over the coffin, and wait -- you couldn't hear
yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn't seem
to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged
undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, "Don't
you worry -- just depend on me." Then he stooped down and begun to
glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's
heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more
and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone
around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in
about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with
a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and
the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or
two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along
the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of
the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands,
and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people's
heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, "He had a rat!"
Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place.
You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because
naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don't cost
nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be
looked up to and liked. There warn't no more popular man in town
than what that undertaker was.</p>

<p>There are dozens of descriptive bits as good as this and others
in which there is no attempt at caricature, such, for instance, as
the picture of the old one-horse cotton plantation of Phelps, which
any one who has seen the South will recognize as a type. What Mark
Twain can do in short sketches of persons is shown by the portrait
of old Mrs. Hotchkiss, which is one of the best things in the book.
Any one who has ever lived in the Southwest, or who has visited
that section, will recognize the truth of all these sketches and
the art with which they are brought into this story. To all readers
we can commend the story as eminently readable. The person who can
withstand the abounding humor of this book must be proof against
all jokes except of the Joe Miller order. The volume is very well
gotten up, the illustrations adding materially to the fun of the
story.</p>
