He Can Keep an Audience in an Uproar Without an Effort.</b><br>
<br>
 Butte, Aug. 1. -- It is doubtful if Maguire's opera house ever
contained a more delighted audience than the one that filled it
to-night to listen to Mark Twain. From his first story of the night
he spent with a coroner's subject until he startled the audience
out of their seats by the sudden ending of his ghost story, the
people laughed until laughing became painful. He spoke for an hour
and a half and told the ludicrous story of the jumping frog, the
story about Huckleberry Finn when his feeling got the best of his
"consciences" while aiding "Jim," the slave, to escape. Greater was
the man who started to tell about an experience his grandfather had
with a ram, but just before reaching the thrilling part of his
narrative wandered from his subject and never got back to it. The
story reminded many people in the audience of a well-known citizen
of Butte.

<p>Then came the story about Mr. Twain's first theft, when he stole
a watermelon from a peddler's wagon, and finding that it was green,
how his conscience troubled him, until he returned it to the
peddler and made him give him a ripe one in exchange for it. The
next narrative was about Tom Sawyer's crusade, and that was
followed with the final number of the programme, the ghost story
about the golden arm.</p>

<p>After the lecture many were honored with an introduction to the
noted humorist and called on him at the Butte where Mr. Clemens,
wife and daughter and Major J. B. Pond and wife are stopping.</p>
