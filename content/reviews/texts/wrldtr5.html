 <b><font size="+2">A CROWD</font><br>
<font size="+1">Heard America's Prince of Humorists and Entertains
Last Night.</font></b><br>
<br>
The opera house, last night, held one of the larget and most
appreciative audiences in its history, the occasion being the
appearance of the greatest of American humorists, Mark Twain. Mr.
Clemens spoke for fully an hour and a half, and the close attention
he received must have been very gratifying. Of course there were a
few who had gone with the idea of hearing something on the negro
minstrel order and these were disappointed. Mr. Clemens' selections
were all taken from his books and while humorous, each contained
some deep thoughts, which hidden perhaps at first reveal themselves
in later examination, and furnished food for thought.

<p>The sketches from Adam's Diary, which Mr. Clemens presented for
the first time last evening, showed probably more originality than
any of the other selections, while his "Watermelon" story was
probably the most humorous, and the "Ghost Story" brought out his
wonderful ability as a story teller, to the best advantage.</p>

<p>On the whole the entertainment was very enjoyable, and no one
who is at all acquainted with Mr. Clemens' works will regret having
heard him.</p>
