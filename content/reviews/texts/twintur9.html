<br>
 One of the largest and it is certain, the most appreciative
audiences of the season assembled last night to hear the readings
of "Mark Twain" (S.L. Clemens) and George W. Cable. The constant
and convulsive laughter of the audience displayed that it needed no
extra effort of these well-known authors to hold their listeners'
attention. Their selections in themselves did that. The inimitable
sketches of Mark Twain and their equally mirth-provoking author,
combined with the bright and spicy extracts by Mr. Cable from his
"Dr. Sevier," made an entertainment that would be hard to be
equaled. Everything they gave was so original that it would be a
difficult task to decide which should claim the greatest merit.

<p>The "Tragic Tale of the Fishwife" by Mark Twain probably
occasioned the most laughter, and as its vein of fun is of a
character that has been pronounced to be beyond parallel, it
deserved all the applause it gained. The house was filled with the
best of Columbus people, and the gentlemen who entertained them
should recognize the decided compliment thus conveyed.</p>
