<p>Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> suggests the query, If it be no easy
  matter to invent one good joke, how hard must it be to be funny to the extent of nearly six
  hundred octavo pages?  Mr. Clemens has essayed the difficult task, and if his humor
  sometimes seems far-fetched or weak, must be admitted to have succeeded on the whole
  better than ninety-nine men out of one hundred would have done.  We would not have it
  understood that the volume is a mere jest book, for it is a recital of its author's experience
  in the remote West.  The facetious element, however, bears about the same relation to the
  veracious narrative as the pattern on a calico dress to the ground color.  Mark's adventures
  in Nevada, among the Mormons in Utah, in California, and in the Sandwich Islands are
  related with a liveliness, and, we must add, with more than occasional imaginativeness
  peculiar to himself.  One may not always approve the taste of what is said, yet he can
  rarely record his dissent without a smile.  The many illustrations are not the least amusing
  feature of the book.</p>
