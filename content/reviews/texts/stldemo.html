<center><b><font size="+1">MARK TWAIN</font><br>
<font size="-1">AT THE MERCANTILE LIBRARY HALL</font><br>
TUESDAY NIGHT.</b></center>

<br>
<p>A gentleman stepped on the stage and announced that wisdom would
commence to flow precisely at eight o'clock. To while away the time
till then, he said he "would treat them with a whistling, which
some called foolish," and a song, "The moon shines bright," both of
which won loud and prolonged applause. Precisely at eight o'clock,
at previously announced, the veritable Mark Twain himself appeared,
to the great delight of the audience. As he informed the audience,
he had been residing in the Sandwich Islands. Being one of the
wandering Bohemians, he had devoted his time to obtaining
information to let the public know of the result of his travels.
After his residence there, he was well-qualified to deliver an
interesting, instructive and amusing lecture. He certainly
succeeded in making it all three. His remarks were witty and
humorous. He kept his audience in a roar of laughter and a
perpetual chuckle. His wit was not of the evanescent kind. One was
not obliged to be always on the qui vive to catch the brilliant
flashes of wit that he dealt with so much ease. Neither was it of
that kind which Douglas Jerrold defines dogmatism, "puppyism come
to maturity."</p>

<p>He was decidedly humorous also. He did not cut the audience
short. His humor was tangible, and the laugh raised at the first
hearing of his remarks died not away with the conclusion of the
sentence. One seemed to be chuckling incessantly, and with faces
wreathed in smiles, the audience listened for the next remarks,
which increased the chuckles to a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>He commenced his lecture on the Sandwich Islands by stating:
"That when at Julesberg, which is about four hundred miles west of
St. Louis, he heard a little anecdote of Horace Greeley, going to
lecture at Carson, from a man who said he was afraid that he would
be too late to hear him. Further westward still, he heard the same
anecdote, or a pleasing incident about the mail service, in
connection with Horace Greeley, and again he heard it in Nevada, or
was about to hear it, when he stopped the story teller, and
inquired of him, if the anecdote was about Horace Greeley, the mail
service, the lecture and Carson City. On being told it was, he
declined hearing it. On coming east, he had seen that anecdote in
almost every newspaper, but he had not heard it in St. Louis, and
therefore he thought he would tell it, as a pleasing incident about
the mail service, in connection with Horace Greeley going to
lecture at Carson City.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I suppose you are all interested in the
Sandwich Islands; of course you must be, because it is the center
of missionary labor. And you all know that hymn which so aptly
refers to it; (he repeats)<br>
</p>

<center>"From Greenland's icy mountains," &amp;c.</center>

As no one was going to lead the singing, he would leave it where it
was.

<p>Sandwich Islands are situated about 2100 miles west of San
Francisco. I wonder why they were placed in the middle of the
ocean; as it is none of our business we won't talk any more about
it. It is a splendid sugar country, better than the best of
Louisiana land, can get from 5,000 to 13,000 pounds of sugar raised
to the acre, but I own no acre there.</p>

<p>The islands are twelve in number, and have volcanoes, the
largest dead volcanoes in the world. Eighty years ago, there was a
population of 400,000 people. The white men came, brought
civilization and several other diseases, and now the race is fast
dying out, and will be extinct in about fifty years hence. They got
consumptive when civilization got there, and they will shortly
retire from business. When they pack up and leave, we will take
possession as lawful heirs. There are 3000 whites there, mostly
Americans, and they are still increasing. They own all the money,
control all the commerce, and own all the ships. They have a
constitutional monarchy, but they have no constitution, and the
monarchy is only an empty name. A Kanaka or native is nobody unless
he has a princely income of $75 annually, or a splendid estate
worth $100. The country is full of office-holders and
office-seekers; there are plenty of such noble patriots. Of almost
any party of three men, two would be office-holders and one an
office-seeker. In a little island, half the size of one of the
wards of St. Louis, there are lots of noblemen, princes, and men of
high degree, with grand titles, holding big offices, receiving
immense salaries--such as ministers of war, secretaries of the
navy, secretaries of state and ministers of justice. They make a
fine display of uniforms, and are very imposing at a funeral.
That's the country for a petty hero to go to, he would soon have
the conceit taken out of him. There are so many of them, that a
noble from any other country would be nobody. They only lionize
their own people, and therefore they lionize everybody. In
education, refinement, and culture, the sons and daughters of our
missionaries there need not be ashamed to compare themselves with
their brothers and sisters in the United States. And there has
never been a stain upon any of their names. The first thing a
stranger does, on arriving at the Islands, is to collect shinbones
of dead Kanakas, fossils and coral, but he never succeeds in
carrying any of them away, because he soon gets tired of it--the
novelty wears off. A stranger going there now need not be looking
for curiosities, for in the back-yard of every house he will see
piles of shinbones of dead Kanakas, heaps of fossils and stacks of
coral. He will also, as a first experiment, pick up about a dozen
Kanaka words; he won't talk English; he won't say good morning,
like a Christian; he will say all-ay-ho. One man had been there
three weeks, and he came to breakfast with me. I asked him how he
would have his beefsteak--rare or well-done. He replied,
"Muckee--muckee--guckee," &amp;c. Well, said I, you can muckee,
muckee, guckee yourself out of this. I won't have anything to do
with you. We can have any climate we want on the Sandwich Islands.
On the summits, which are 16,000 feet above the level of the
valley, whose tops are whitened by perpetual snow, we can have
everlasting winter, and near the sea shore everlasting summer. A
single glance of the eye takes in all the climates on the earth. It
was so cold on the tops of the mountains that I could not speak the
truth, but on level ground, I can speak the truth as well--as any
other man.</p>

<p>The climate is wonderfully healthy, for white people in
particular, so healthy that white people venture on the most
reckless imprudence. They get up too early; you can see them as
early as half past seven in the morning, and they attend to all
their business, and keep it up till sundown. It don't hurt 'em, it
don't kill 'em, and yet it ought to do so. I have seen it so hot in
California that greenbacks went up 142 in the shade.</p>

<p>The volcano of Kee-law-ay-oh is 17,000 feet in diameter, and
from 700 to 800 feet deep. Vesuvius is nowhere. It is the largest
dead volcano in the world. You witness a scene of unrivaled
sublimity, and witness the most astonishing sights. When the
volcano of Kee-law-ay-oh broke through a few years ago, lava flowed
out of it for twenty days and twenty nights, and made a stream
forty miles in length, till it reached the sea, tearing up forests
in its awful fiery path, swallowing up huts, destroying all
vegetation, rioting through shady dells and sinuous canyons. Amidst
this carnival of destruction, majestic columns of smoke ascended,
and formed a cloudy murky pall overhead. Sheets of green, blue,
lambent flame were shot upwards and pierced this vast gloom, making
all sublimely grand. [After this burst of eloquence, he clapped his
hands and the audience joined, making the vaulted roof of the
Library hall reverberate with the sounds of enthusiastic
applause.]</p>

<p>I once knew a great, tall gawky country editor, near
Sacramento,to whom I sent an ode of the sea, starting with "The
long, green swell of the Pacific." The country editor sent back a
letter and stated that I couldn't fool him, and he didn't want any
base insinuations from me. He knew who I meant when I wrote "the
long, green swell of the Pacific."</p>

<p>There is one thing characteristic of the tropics that a stranger
must have, whether he likes it or not, and that is the boo-hoo
fever. Its symptoms are nausea of the stomach, severe headache,
backache and bellyache, and a general utter indifference whether
the school keeps or not. You can't be a full citizen of the
Sandwich Island unless you have had the boo-hoo fever. You will
never forget it. I remember a little boy who had it once there. A
New Yorker asked him if he was afraid to die. He said, no; I am not
afraid to die of anything, except the boo-hoo fever. The moral
force used by the missionaries, in the Sandwich Islands, is not
much. But they are the right kind of men there--they have just the
grit, to hold on like grim death. Bishop Staley of the English
Missionary church is not very popular. The societies in London have
ceased to support him, and his mission has a dull, unhealthy look.
The King belongs to the church, but he never goes there, and he
still adheres to the pagan form of worship. The king is a
gentleman, but the American missionaries made him so. The bishop's
church is making some progress, and there is plenty of room for it;
but they will never succeed in ousting the American missionaries.
[After another burst of eloquence about some perennial flower, he
applauds himself; would repeat it again if requested to by the
audience; the audience requests him to proceed, but the lecturer
declines with such a comical gesture, that it sends the audience
into convulsions.]</p>

<p>In Honolulu, merchants go to their business at nine <font size=
"-1">A.M.</font>, and cease business at four <font size="-1">
P.M.</font> They will have nothing to do with business till next
morning. Why cannot we do so? But I did not come here to preach a
sermon to you, although I would as soon do it as not. A street
fight keeps the people excited for about two weeks; an elopement
gives them something to converse about for one year, but a murder
they will never get over talking about it. The whites of Honolulu
have no jokes to indulge in. They are not imbued with the spirit of
joking. I told some jokes to a quiet, sober-looking, grave, and
demure missionary, and I believe he is exercised over some of the
subtler ones to this day. The missionaries do not know one third
the names of sins which figure in the sin calendar. Pity we are not
more like them. The people do not get often drunk in that country;
the duties are too high. But I saw some of the wild ranchmen of
Hawaii drink kerosene and aquafortis, and I saw some of them get
drunk on a whole barrel of Mustang Liniment. When the natives eat,
they all eat socially, from the same calabash, one after the other,
with their fingers. They are not very particular or careful whether
these hands are washed or not. It is not absolutely necessary that
they should wash their hands. They have a fish called poy which
they eat. Eating poy will cure a drunkard. In order to like the poy
you must get used to it. It smells a good deal worse than it
tastes, and it tastes a good deal worse than it looks. I am sending
all my friends there.</p>

<p>The natives are of a rich, dark brown color, lazy, perhaps, but
not vicious, nor very virtuous. The women wear a long, loose calico
garment, but the men don't. [Loud and continued applause.] Guess I
won't continue that subject any longer. In former times the King's
person was sacred, he was the supreme head of the Church and State,
he was the captain over all, the arbiter of fate, the Lord of life.
There was a law that if a man came to the king with a wet head, he
should die; if any man's shadow fell on the king he had to die. If
the king put his taboo on anyone, there was no hope for him (by the
bye, from there we got our word tabooed). In former times the women
were abject slaves of the whole party. By the ancient taboo, (law
of the land,) death was the punishment of a woman who dared to sit
at the same table as a man. If she ate choice fruit, she was to
suffer the death penalty. The poor degraded savages of these
islands found out somehow that a woman ate some fruit in the Garden
of Eden, and the whole human race were suffering from that thing
ever since, and therefore they were not willing to take the chance
of some other evil overtaking them, by letting women eat any fruit.
But the American missionaries came, broke off the shackles from the
whole race, broke the power of the King, the State and the clergy,
and elevated the women to be the equal of the men. To-day, it is
the best educated nation in the world, of its size. Our
missionaries did it all. Every Kanaka has a dozen mothers. If they
like a woman, they call her mother. A Los Angelos man got there
once, and being boss over a party of Kanakas, one day one of them
came to him, and asked leave of absence to go and bury his mother.
Of course the leave was granted. In about a month he came to ask
for another leave of absence, for the same purpose, he got that
also. For several times he obtained leave of absence to go and bury
a mother. On the fifth demand, the Los Angelos man asked him how
many mothers he had. He answered--twelve--well, go and bury them
all, but don't let me see you again.</p>

<p>Those natives are strange folk. They are not afraid of death,
no, no more than a jilted Frenchman. If they take a notion to die,
nothing will stop them, you can't argue it out of them. They are
also fond of dogs. Such dogs that a white man would condemn at
first right on general principles. They are not large dogs,
neither; neither are they useful ones, but ugly curs. They love the
pups, better than any of their own family. They will take care of a
pup--pet him--feed him--caress him--fondle him, and when he has
become fat, they kill him--cook him--and then eat him. The natives
are very fond of raw fish, they will bite into a living fish, and
then eat him up. There used to be some cannnibals, but they are
almost played out. One cannibal once, after eating several
specimens of his own race, caught a missionary--killed him--and
served him up, but he could not digest the old missionary, no more
than he could a keg of nails; he died--miserably died. They are
also very fond of horses. These are probably worth about seven
dollars and a half--the scrubbiest lot of horses in the world. They
have eleven distinct styles of gallop. When one of them gallops he
mixes them all up at once, making it rather uncomfortable. The
women all ride like men. I wish to introduce that reform in this
country. Our ladies ought, by all means to ride like men, these
side saddles are so dangerous. When women meet each other on the
road, they run and kiss and hug each other, and they don't
blackguard each other behind each other's backs. I would like to
introduce that reform, also. I am not married, myself, but yet I
have no right to advertise myself this way publicly. Still I am not
married. In former times, when a great noble died, they bit pieces
of their own bodies off--knocked two or three teeth out. They would
also kill now and then an infant--bury him alive sometimes. But the
missionaries have annihilated infanticide. The American
missionaries are opposed to infanticide--for my part, I can't see
why. It is an old adage, be virtuous and you will be happy. The
nation are not virtuous and yet they are happy. When a woman cries,
a dozen others will congregate around and they will whine, blubber,
bawl and sniffle for an hour together. Rare sympathizing crowd. I
will end this chapter and the lecture by stating that they do
everything wrong end foremost, dismount from a horse the wrong
side, and mounting a horse on the wrong side. The same word stands
for good-bye and how do you do. In the noble American game of
high-low-jack or seven-up, they deal the cards to the left instead
of the right. They bathe in the middle of the day, and are liable
to kill themselves. When inviting a person to approach, they make a
sign, that with us is considered a repulsive motion. The duck, a
water bird, lives 5000 feet above the level of the water. They
dance at funerals, and spit on a spoon when they want to clean it.
They wash their shirts with a club, and iron them with a
brick-bat.</p>

<p>The talented young lecturer closed his flow of wisdom, by
stating that by an inadvertence, he had forgotten to inform his
appreciative audience "that the Reverend Robert Colyer was
lecturing at the Philharmonic hall, and it seemed by that omission
he had swindled the reverend gentleman out of a crowd." Everyone
retired highly delighted with the irrepressible Californian.</p>
