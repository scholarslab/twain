<br>
 Mark Twain tried an experiment last night. His subject was one of
the most brilliant audiences that ever crowded into the
Metropolitan and sweltered in the heat of mid-summer. His
experiment was upon the arrangement of the stories for their
entertainment. The programs distributed were consequently entirely
misleading, but the story telling was up to par, and as most of the
audience had read Twain it made very little difference.

<p>He started off with that moral lecture on courage, in which he
makes the wise observation that every man's courage has a limit,
and then told how his limit was reached when he discovered a dead
man in his father's office at midnight, after one of his truancies.
The famous "Jumping Frog," that proved Twain a humorist and is
still regarded as one of his greatest stories, followed. The
rambling "Story of the Ram" was particularly humorous and brought
out more laughter than any other, but it was not more lifelike than
Tom Sawyer's conversation with Huckleberry Finn and himself on
starting a crusade. In this Mr. Twain seemed to point an innocent
idea at the socialistic idea of property which half-hidden,
half-revealed, formed the basis of his tale.</p>

<p>Then came the "First Theft" of the watermelon, but without doubt
the best story, and the one which the audience listened to with
hushed attention, was the pathetic struggle with his conscience
over his aiding to liberty runaway Darky Jim. Huck Finn and Jim on
the raft, both running away from harsh treatment, is one of the
prettiest pictures of anti[ante?]-emancipation life on the
Mississippi that has ever been penned. Mark hit the educated
conscience theory a pretty hard rap and then, just to show that he
could tell a story that was not located in the Mississippi valley
or in the far West, he gave the story of the christening. In this
Mr. Twain showed himself not only a story writer but a mimic. He
copied the Scotch-Irish preacher to perfection, and bowed the large
audience out well pleased to have seen and heard America's greatest
humorist.</p>

<p>After the lecture came the reception to Clemens at the
Commercial Club. It was fairly well attended, but no doubt hundreds
of people would have paid their respects to the veteran fun-maker
if it could have been known that no special invitation was
expected. Mr. Clemens was accompanied by Maj. and Mrs. Pond, but
Mrs. Clemens begged to be excused, as she was tired out with the
journey. The affair was simple and informal. Mayor and Mrs. Pratt,
President Calderwood, of the Commercial Club, and several other
gentlemen presented the callers to the guest of honor and he had
his hands full to chat with the many that crowded about to see the
humorist as a man.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens had been in bed all day, and his lecture took nearly
all his conserved energy, but he chatted pleasantly and kept
everyone at ease with his droll observations. A light refreshment
followed the reception in the parlors, and about 11 o'clock Maj.
Pond and President Calderwood escorted Mark Twain to his hotel.</p>

<p>Among those at the reception were Mayor and Mrs. Robert Pratt,
C.H. Pryor and ladies, Mr. and Mrs. Charles P. Preston, Dr. and
Mrs. Charles M. Jordan, Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Edsten, Mr. and Mrs.
J.S. McLain, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Gregory, Mr. and Mrs. James Pye,
Dr. W.E. Leonard, C.R. Cameron, M.D. Shutter, E.W. Herrick, Rev.
and Mrs. Dr. Sneed, George Strong, F.V. Brown, W.M. Hopkins, A.B.
Choat, W.O. Stout, W.B. Stout, D. Willard, Harry Wheeler, W.C.
Corbett, W.H. Randall, Al. Warner and Frederick Clarke.</p>

<p>This is the fifth of the series of lectures to be given by Mr.
Clemens in a trip around the world. Maj. Pond says that it has been
successful far beyond his highest expectation. He claims to have
made money enough to take the party around the world and $1,000 to
spare up to this point. Twain will give his readings in St. Paul
this evening, thence go to Winnipeg and subsequently to Butte and
Helena, Mont.</p>

<p>A dinner is to be given to <a name="a">Mr. Clemens</a> and Maj.
Pond at the Minneapolis Club this noon.</p>

<br>
 <b><font size="+1">Mark Twain's Lecture.</font></b><br>
<br>
 If there has ever been any question in the mind of Mark Twain as
to the regard in which by that portion of the reading public which
claims Minneapolis as its home, it must have been settled, and in a
most satisfactory manner, too, when he stepped upon the stage at
the Metropolitan last night, and confronted the sea of faces in the
big auditorium. With the possible exception of the night when Ysaye
made his appearance, the theater never has held a more brilliant
audience, and the warmth of welcome which greeted the distinguished
humorist was an index to the place he occupies in the affections of
those whom for the past three decades he has been endeavoring to
amuse. Time has dealt kindly with Mr. Clemens. There are signs of
age in the whitening hair, but there is the old-time twinkle in the
deep blue eyes, the same funny drawl about the speech, the
wonderful lighting up of the mobile, expressive face and the
inimitable charm to his story-telling that has made his efforts on
the rostrum so acceptable in the past.

<p>The program last night was not one calculated to bring out
boisterous merriment. The selections were permeated by a quiet
humor that made them entertaining, but in all of them was an
underlying vein of philosophy pointing to some moral -- a moral not
always strictly orthodox. Perhaps this was something of a
disappointment to many of those who attended, expecting to be
convulsed with laughter, but it was not for that reason less
enjoyable. As given, it was a judicious blending of the pathetic
and homely with those occasional scintillations of wit that flashed
like dew drops in the morning sun, and in obedience to the law of
contrasts each bringing out the other in stronger and more
pronounced relief. There is no gainsaying the fact that the big
audience was delightfully entertained during the short hour and a
half and that it quitted the theater reluctantly when the end of
the program was announced.</p>

<p>Including in the selections given last night were the famous
"Story of the Jumping Frog," "My First Theft" and the rambling
story of "Granther's Ram," a tale with a beginning that promised
well but which was never finished. The story of finding a corpse in
his father's office was a weird and uncanny bit of recital -- a
thing in which Mark Twain particularly excels. Possibly the best of
all was the story of Huck Finn helping the negro Jim to escape from
slavery. There was a humorously pathetic tone to the story of Huck
Finn's struggles with his conscience which would not let him rest
easy either when he was endeavoring to hide or betray the slave
whom he was aiding to escape to freedom. The one in which Tom
Sawyer proposes to Huck Finn and Jim that they organize a crusade
and rescue the "Holy Land" from the grasp of the infidels was a
delightful bit of boy nature and boyish aspiration, and was
thoroughly enjoyable. The program closed with a sketch of a
Scotch-Irish christening in which the pompous preacher was pictured
perfectly.</p>

<p>As Mr. Clemens turned to leave the stage, there was a storm of
applause and in obedience to the demand for another story, he gave
the "Whistling Story," which no one can tell so well as he. When he
had finished, he remained standing on the stage and bowed the large
audience out -- an audience that was well pleased to have met the
most genial humorist of the present age.</p>

<p>The reception given to the distinguished humorist at the
Commercial Club by the members of the club and the newspaper men of
the city was a most informal affair, but none the less pleasant on
that account. The gathering was not nearly so large as expected,
and for this Mr. Clemens was, no doubt, thankful, as he was not in
condition to enjoy a crush. Mayor and Mrs. Robert Pratt, Maj. and
Mrs. Pond, and President Calderwood attended to the introductions
and saw that all had an opportunity of a few moments' conversation
with the celebrated humorist, who is as affable off the stage as he
is enjoyable on it. Mrs. Clemens was indisposed and could not
attend.</p>

<p>A simple lunch was served about 11 o'clock, after which the
celebrated funmaker was escorted to his hotel by Mr.
Calderwood.</p>
