<h2>New York <i>Times</i> [unsigned]<br>
1877: January 13</h2>

<p>Shades of the venerable Mr. Day, of the instructive Mrs.
Barbauld, of the persuasive Miss Edgeworth! Had you the power of
sitting today beside the reviewer's desk, and were called upon to
pass judgment on the books written and printed for the boys and
girls of today, would you not have groaned and moaned over their
perusal? If such superlatively good children as Harry and Lucy
could have existed, or even such nondescript prigs as Sandford and
Merton had abnormal being, this other question presents itself to
our mind: "How would these precious children have enjoyed Mark
Twain's <i>Tom Sawyer</i>"? In all books written for the amusement
of children there are two distinct phases of appreciation. What the
parent thinks of the book is one thing; what the child thinks of it
is another. It is fortunate when both parent and child agree in
their conclusions. Such double appreciation may, in most instances,
simply be one in regard to the fitness of the book on the part of
the parent. A course of reading entirely devoted to juvenile works
must be to an adult a tax on time and patience. It is only once in
many years that such a charming book as <i>Little Alice in
Wonderland</i> is produced, which old and young could read with
thorough enjoyment. If, thirty years ago, <i>Tom Sawyer</i> had
been placed in a careful father's hands to read, the probabilities
would have been that he would have hesitated before giving the book
to his boy -- not that Mr. Clemens' book is exceptional in
character, or differs in the least, save in its cleverness, from a
host of similar books on like topics which are universally read by
children today. It is the judgment of the book-givers which has
undoubtedly undergone a change, while youthful minds, being free
from warp, twist, or dogma, have remained ever the same.</p>

<p>Returning then to these purely intellectual monstrosities,
mostly the pen-and-ink offspring of authors and authoresses who
never had any real flesh and blood creations of their own, there
can be no doubt that had Sandford or Merton ever for a single
moment dipped inside of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>'s pages, astronomy and
physics, with all the musty old farrago of Greek and Latin history,
would have been thrown to the dogs. Despite tasseled caps, starched
collars, and all the proprieties, these children would have laughed
uproariously over Tom Sawyer's "cat and the pain-killer," and
certain new ideas might have had birth in their brains. Perhaps had
these children actually lived in our times, Sandford might have
been a Western steam-boat captain, or Merton a fillibuster. <i>Tom
Sawyer</i> is likely to inculcate the idea that there are certain
lofty aspirations which Plutarch never ascribed to his more prosaic
heroes. Books for children in former bygone periods were mostly
constructed in one monotonous key. A child was supposed to be a
vessel which was to be constantly filled up. Facts and morals had
to be taken like bitter draughts or acrid pills. In order that they
should be absorbed like medicines it was perhaps a kindly thinker
who disguised these facts and morals. The real education swallowed
in those doses by the children we are inclined to think was in
small proportion to the quantity administered. Was it not good old
Peter Parley who in this country first broke loose from
conventional trammels, and made American children truly happy? We
have certainly gone far beyond Mr. Goodrich's manner. There has
come an amount of ugly realism into children's story-books, the
advantages of which we are very much in doubt about.</p>

<p>Now, it is perfectly true that many boys do not adopt
drawing-room manners. Perhaps it is better that little paragons
-- pocket Crichtons -- are so rare. Still, courage,
frankness, truthfulness, and self-reliance are to be inculcated in
our lads. Since association is everything, it is not desirable that
in real life we should familiarize our children with those of their
age who are lawless or dare-devils. Granting that the natural is
the true, and the true is the best, and that we may describe things
as they are for adult readers, it is proper that we should
discriminate a great deal more as to the choice of subjects in
books intended for children. Today a majority of the heroes in such
books have longings to be pirates, want to run away with vessels,
and millions of our American boys read and delight in such stories.
ln olden times the <i>Pirate's Own Book</i> with its death's-head
and crossbones on the back had no concealment about it. It is true,
edition after edition was sold. There it was. You saw it palpably.
There was no disguise about it. If a father or mother objected to
their child's reading the <i>Pirate's Own Book,</i> a pair of tongs
and a convenient fireplace ended the whole matter. Today the
trouble is: that there is a decidedly sanguinary tendency in
juvenile books. No matter how innocent, quiet, or tame may be the
title of a child's book, there is no guarantee that the volume your
curlyhcaded little boy may be devouring may not contain a series of
adventures recalling Capt. Kidd's horrors. In the short preface of
<i>Tom Sawyer</i> Mr. Clemens writes, "Although my book is intended
mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not
be shunned by men and women on that account." We have before
expressed the idea that a truly clever child's book is one in which
both the man and the boy can find pleasure. No child's book can be
perfectly acceptable otherwise. Is <i>Tom Sawyer</i> amusing? It is
incomparably so. It is the story of a Western boy, born and bred on
the banks of one of the big rivers, and there is exactly that wild
village life which has schooled many a man to self-reliance and
energy. Mr. Clemens has a remarkable memory for those peculiarities
of American boy-talk which the grown man may have forgotten, but
which return to him not unpleasantly when once the proper key is
sounded. There is one scene of a quarrel, with a dialogue, between
Tom and a city boy which is perfect of its kind. Certain chapters
in Tom's life, where his love for the schoolgirls is told, make us
believe that for an urchin who had just lost his milk-teeth the
affections out West have an awakening even earlier than in Oriental
climes. In fact, Tom is a preternaturally precocious urchin. One
admirable character in the book, and touched with the hand of a
master, is that of Huckleberry Finn. Thcre is a reality about this
boy which is striking. An honest old aunt, who adores her
scapegrace nephew, is a homely picture worked with exceeding grace.
Mr. Clemens must have had just such a lovable old aunt. An ugly
murder in the book, overminutely described and too fully
illustrated, which Tom and Huck see, of course, in a graveyard,
leads, somehow or other, to the discovery of a cave, in which
treasures are concealed, and to which Tom and Huck fall heirs.
There is no cant about Mr. Clemens. A description of a
Sunday-school in <i>Tom Sawyer</i> is true to the letter. Matters
are not told as they are fancied to be, but as they actually
are.</p>

<p>If Mr. Clemens has been wanting in continuity in his longer
sketches, and that sustained inventive power necessary in
dovetailing incidents, Tom, as a story, though slightly disjointed,
has this defect less apparent. As a humorist, Mr. Clemens has a
great deal of fun in him, of the true American kind, which crops
out all over thc book. Mr. Clemens has an audience both here and in
England, and doubtless his friends across the water will re-echo
"the hearty laughs which the reading of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> will
cause on this side of the world." We are rather inclined to treat
books intended for boys and girls, written by men of accredited
talent and reputation, in a serious manner. Early impressions are
the lasting ones. It is exactly such a clever book as <i>Tom
Sawyer</i> which is sure to leave its stamp on younger minds. We
like, then, the true boyish fun of Tom and Huck, and have a foible
for the mischief these children engage in. We have not the least
objection that rough boys be the heroes of a story-book. Restless
spirits of energy only require judicious training in order to bring
them into proper use. In the books to be placed into children's
hands for purposes of recreation, we have a preference for those of
a milder type than <i>Tom Sawyer.</i> Excitements derived from
reading should be administered with a certain degree of
circumspection. A sprinkling of salt in mental food is both natural
and wholesome; any cravings for the contents of the castors, the
cayenne and the mustard, by children, should not be gratified. With
less, then, of Injun Joe and "revenge," and "slitting women's
ears," and the shadow of the gallows, which throws an unnecessarily
sinister tinge over the story, (if the book really is intended for
boys and girls) we should have liked <i>Tom Sawyer</i> better.</p>
