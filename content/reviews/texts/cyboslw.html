 1890: February 15</h2>

<br>
 

<p>Mark Twain's latest book, which his publishers have brought out
in a handsome volume, seems to us the poorest of all his
productions thus far. The conceit of taking a Yankee of this
generation of telephones and the electric light back to King
Arthur's Court may please some minds, if presented in a story of
moderate length, but there can be few who will really enjoy it when
long-drawn out to the extent of nearly six hundred pages. Whatever
value Mr. Clemens might have incidentally imparted to his burlesque
by giving something like a correct picture of the customs of the
time in which the mythical King flourished is entirely absent. He
has crowded into his picture a great number of episodes
illustrating "ungentle laws and customs" which are historical,
indeed; but he says:</p>

<p><font size="-1">It is not pretended that these laws and customs
existed in England in the sixth century; no, it is only pretended
that, inasmuch as they existed in the English and other
civilizations of far later times, it is safe to consider that it is
no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in
practice in that day also. One is quite justified in inferring that
wherever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that remote
time, its place was competently filled by a worse one.</font></p>

<p>Mr. Clemens' method of writing history would justify him in
picturing the Connecticut of the seventeenth century as afflicted
with loose divorce customs and great corruption at the polls -- or
something worse -- simply because these are vices of the nineteenth
century! To crowd into a representation of one age the social evils
of all its successors known to us, and to omit those special
redeeming features of the time which made life tolerable, is a very
irrational proceeding.</p>

<p>The serious aim under Mark Twain's travesty is the glorification
of American Protestant democracy. The effort fails through the
extreme partiality of the procedure. Even a Mark Twain, the
persistent teacher of irreverence for great men and great events,
should have some little respect left for fair play. Mr. Clemens'
previous books have been bad enough in their strong encouragement
of one of the worst tendencies in a democratic State, the
inclination to sheer flippancy and unmanly irreverence in the face
of the natural sanctities of private life and the grand heroisms of
human history. But this volume goes much further in its endeavor to
belittle a century surrounded with romantic light by men of later
times, who thus fell back upon poetry as a slight relief to the
hard prose of their actual lot. A buffoon, like the hero of this
tale, playing his contemptible tricks where Sir Thomas Malory has
trod with a noble teaching of knightly courtesy, and uttering his
witless jokes where Tennyson has drawn so many a high moral of true
gentleness, is a sorry spectacle. It is not calculated to make a
reflecting person proud of a shallow and self-complacent generation
which can enjoy such so-called humor.</p>

<p>The one consolation to be derived from this melancholy product
of the American mind in the ninth decade of the nineteenth century
is that, equally in its serious and in its jesting parts, it must
bring about a healthy reaction in some of its admiring readers
because it overshoots the mark; because its history is perverse, in
its one-sided accumulation of evils; and because its humor will be
wearisome in the extreme when its falsity is seen.</p>

<p>When <a name="a">Mr. Clemens</a> relates his Life on the
Mississippi with characteristic American exaggeration, we cannot
fail to laugh and become friends. But when he prostitutes his
humorous gift to the base uses of historical injustice, democratic
bigotry, Protestant intolerance, and nineteenth-century vainglory,
we must express the very sincere animosity we feel at such a
performance. If anything could be less of a credit to our
literature than the matter of this book, it certainly is the
illustrations which disfigure it. A Protestant of the Protestants
himself, the writer of this review cannot refrain from thus freeing
his soul in the cause of literary decency when the Roman Catholic
Church, that is to say the Christian Church in one of the noblest
periods of its history, is thus grossly assailed by the writer and
the illustrator of this tiresome travesty.</p>
