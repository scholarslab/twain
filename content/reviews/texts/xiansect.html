<h2>Hartford <i>Christian Secretary</i> [unsigned]<br>
1877: May 17</h2>

<p>Our city of Hartford can boast the greatest humorist in current
literature. Mr. Clemens owes nothing to erratic spelling like
"Artemas Ward," or to exciting political themes like some other
witty writers. He is altogether original and unique. "The Innocents
Abroad," is an exhaustless feast vastly entertaining and full of
information as a book of travels. The same charm of genius in an
unusual direction fills the fascinating pages of "Tom Sawyer." The
boy hero and the other children are so lifelike that the reader
hardly needs the author's assurance that real boys and genuine
parts are in the book. One gets very fond of Tom notwithstanding
his grave faults, some of which you almost wish had been omitted.
But he is a brave, manly boy after all, and the finest scene in the
whole story to one reader at least, is where he receives a whipping
to shield a little, terrified girl. The childish attachment between
these two and the manly protection Tom accords to little Becky both
at school and amid the horrors of being lost in the cave, are very
finely described. To one who had only seen the other side of Tom's
character these noble traits would have seemed impossible. The
"pain-killer" adventure is funny beyond expression as is much of
Tom's career. The last few chapters are extremely sensational and
strike one as too remarkable to be natural adventures for little
boys. One cannot help regretting that so fine a fellow as Tom lies
and smokes, but the intention was not to describe a model boy. Yet
these traits solely detract from the hero. Those who regard Mark
Twain as only "a funny man," greatly underestimate his power. Wit
is the spice of his books not the substance. In this story are some
most exquisitely beautiful descriptions. That of early morning in
one place particularly, is delicious in its perfect picture of
nature and its beautiful poetry.</p>
