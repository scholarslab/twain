<p>[<i>Transcribed from Pond's <a href="tourad.jpg">broadside

<p>The very unique and happy entertainment afforded by Mark Twain
and Mr. Cable in their joint recitations deserves the warmest
praise the press can give it. The former's manner and speech on the
platform, which are clearly unaffected, admirably supplement the
humor of his thought and language. His style is evidently an
expression of himself. The gravity of his features while reciting
his side-splitting productions, is equal to the apparent sincerity
and frankness with which he guyed that interviewer, and even
occasionally draws his audience into a trap and then inwardly
laughs at them. The most of his hearers Saturday afternoon and
evening endured all in the way of laughter to which it was safe for
Mr. Clemens to expose them. But they will be ready to take a second
dose whenever he can conventiently visit us again.</p>

<p>Whoever has read Mr. Cable's "Grandissimes" and his "Dr. Sevier"
was prepared to find in their author a man of talent and culture.
But we confess our own surprise over his remarkable powers as an
elocutionist. He has the delicate form, the small hands and feet,
the keen, intellectual features that excite remark from a stranger
in first seeing General Mahone, of Virginia. His voice, though
pitched on a high key, is sweet, musical, and flexible, and in his
recitiations he is equally happy in portraying the humorous and the
pathetic features of his works. His Creole songs are, to those who
have never heard them, a revelation of a new and delicious charm in
music. In gentle, genial humor nothing could well have been happier
than his representation of the courting scene between Ristofalo and
the delightful Irish widow in his Dr. Sevier, but for dramatic
fire, his rendering of the passage describing the encounter of Mrs.
Richling and her friend, the scout, with the Confederate pickets,
and the subsequent ride for life could not well be surpassed.</p>

<p>It is rare that authors are endowed as these gentlemen are, with
the power of interpreting their own creations to public gatherings.
We have no doubt that they enjoy it as much as their hearers do,
and they have the satisfaction of knowing that the entertainment,
in all its features, is solely due to their own genius.</p>
