<h2><i>Atlantic Monthly</i> [unsigned; William Dean Howells]<br>
 1876: May</h2>

<p>Mr. Aldrich has studied the life of A Bad Boy as the pleasant
reprobate led it in a quiet old New England town twenty-five or
thirty years ago, where in spite of the natural outlawry of boyhood
he was more or less part of a settled order of things, and was
hemmed in, to some measure, by the traditions of an established
civilization. Mr. Clemens, on the contrary, has taken the boy of
the Southwest for the hero of his new book, and has presented him
with a fidelity to circumstance which loses no charm by being
realistic in the highest degree, and which gives incomparably the
best picture of life in that region as yet known to fiction. The
town where Tom Sawyer was born and brought up is some such idle,
shabby little Mississippi River town as Mr. Clemens has so well
described in his piloting reminiscences, but Tom belongs to the
better sort of people in it, and has been bred to fear God and
dread the Sunday-school according to the strictest rite of the
faiths that have characterized all the respectability of the West.
His subjection in these respects does not so deeply affect his
inherent tendencies but that he makes himself a beloved burden to
the poor, tender-hearted old aunt who brings him up with his orphan
brother and sister, and struggles vainly with his manifold sins,
actual and imaginary. The limitations of his transgressions are
nicely and artistically traced. He is mischievous, but not vicious;
he is ready for almost any depredation that involves the danger and
honor of adventure, but profanity he knows may provoke a
thunderbolt upon the heart of the blasphemer, and he almost never
swears; he resorts to any stratagem to keep out of school, but he
is not a downright liar, except upon terms of after shame and
remorse that make his falsehood bitter to him. He is cruel, as all
children are, but chiefly because he is ignorant; he is not mean,
but there are very definite bounds to his generosity; and his
courage is the Indian sort, full of prudence and mindful of retreat
as one of the conditions of prolonged hostilities. In a word, he is
a boy, and merely and exactly an ordinary boy on the moral side.
What makes him delightful to the reader is that on the imaginative
side he is very much more, and though every boy has wild and
fantastic dreams, this boy cannot rest till he has somehow realized
them. Till he has actually run off with two other boys in the
character of buccaneer, and lived for a week on an island in the
Mississippi, he has lived in vain; and this passage is but the
prelude to more thrilling adventures, in which he finds hidden
treasures, traces the bandits to their cave, and is himself lost in
its recesses. The local material and the incidents with which his
career is worked up are excellent, and throughout there is
scrupulous regard for the boy's point of view in reference to his
surroundings and himself, which shows how rapidly Mr. Clemens has
grown as an artist. We do not remember anything in which this
propriety is violated, and its preservation adds immensely to the
grown-up reader's satisfaction in the amusing and exciting story.
There is a boy's love-affair, but it is never treated otherwise
than as a boy's love-affair. When the half-breed has murdered the
young doctor, Tom and his friend, Huckleberry Finn, are really, in
their boyish terror and superstition, going to let the poor old
town-drunkard be hanged for the crime, till the terror of that
becomes unendurable. The story is a wonderful study of the
boy-mind, which inhabits a world quite distinct from that in which
he is bodily present with his elders, and in this lies its great
charm and its universality, for boy-nature, however human nature
varies, is the same everywhere.</p>

<p>The tale is very dramatically wrought, and the subordinate
characters are treated with the same graphic force that sets Tom
alive before us. The worthless vagabond, Huck Finn, is entirely
delightful throughout, and in his promised reform his identity is
respected: he will lead a decent life in order that he may one day
be thought worthy to become a member of that gang of robbers which
Tom is to organize. Tom's aunt is excellent, with her kind heart's
sorrow and secret pride in Tom; and so is his sister Mary, one of
those good girls who are born to usefulness and charity and
forbearance and unvarying rectitude. Many village people and local
notables are introduced in well-conceived character; the whole
little town lives in the reader's sense, with its religiousness,
its lawlessness, its droll social distinctions, its civilization
qualified by its slave-holding, and its traditions of the wilder
West which has passed away. The picture will be instructive to
those who have fancied the whole Southwest a sort of vast Pike
County, and have not conceived of a sober and serious and orderly
contrast to the sort of life that has come to represent the
Southwest in literature. Mr. William M. Baker gives a notion of
this in his stories, and Mr. Clemens has again enforced the fact
here, in a book full of entertaining character, and of the greatest
artistic sincerity.</p>

<p>Tom Brown and Tom Bailey are, among boys in books, alone
deserving to be named with Tom Sawyer.</p>
