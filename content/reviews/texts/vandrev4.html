delivered the second lecture of the Clayonian course last evening,
in the Opera House, to a very large and attentive audience. His
subject was "Brother Jonathan Abroad." He explained, by way of
introduction, that while the educated Americans who travel abroad
are accustomed upon their return home to write descriptions of
their journeys for the benefit of their friends and to moralize in
books and lectures upon what they have seen, the "Vandal" (and he
desired to be respectful in the use of the term, which he
interpreted to mean those travellers whose pockets were heavier
than their store of learning or historical research), had no such
opportunity for a multiplicity of reasons, the chief of which was a
want of early education. He therefore volunteered to be their
historian, having been a close observer of their habits.</p>

<p>The lecturer then described in a most humorous manner, the
ramblings of the "American vandal," what he saw and how he was
impressed by the exhibitions of ancient grandeur or influenced by
old historical surroundings and associations. In the course of his
remarks he painted in glowing language and with choice words scenes
of cities and places and of statues and paintings, that will be
slow to fade from the memories of the audience. Chief among them
were descriptions of Venice, of Athens by moonlight from the
Acropolis, of Damascus, the most ancient metropolis, of the Sphinx,
which has looked upon thousands of years of history with its stony
eyes yet reveals nothing, and of the picture galleries of Rome and
Milan. These were clothed in the beautiful rhetoric of poetry in
prose. In the humorous parts the speaker resembled Artemus Ward in
his slow and quaint way of saying very amusing things. The audience
was constantly convulsed with laughter, and was continued in its
happy humor by quiet touches of wit and sentiment. Altogether it
was a most enjoyable evening's entertainment.</p>
