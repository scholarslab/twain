<center><b>Review of Mark Twain's Lecture.--<br>
Respectfully Dedicated to those People who admire Gough<br>
and can't bear Independent Criticism.--</b></center>

<p>Mark Twain lectured at Institute Hall last evening. At an early
hour the intelligent, virtuous, high-minded, patriotic and
well-dressed people of this enterprising and lovely village might
have been seen wending their way to the Hall, &amp;c., &amp;c. The
Hall was well filled, all the seats that were occupied being
crowded. As Mr. Byron (whom some of our readers may remember
sometimes made up verses out of his head), once said, "the lamps
shone bright o'er fair women and brave men and all went merry as a
marriage bell." (Lest any one should take offense however, we
explain that the Hall was <i>not</i> lighted with "lamps" but with
gas, manufactured by our intelligent, efficient and high-minded Gas
Co. Bryon is to blame for the word "lamps" in this quotation, not
we. We hope this explanation will prevent the Gas Co. shutting off
our gas again, or any one else being offended and stopping his
paper.) The <i>elite</i> of this place was assembled, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. It is rarely seldom that so select an audience fills
Institute Hall. The lecturer no doubt felt highly honored and
flattered at his reception, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of the lecture we need say nothing, &amp;c. Mr. Twain spoke for
himself, &amp;c. We only need say that it was fully up to
expectations, and exceeded the anticipations of the most sanguine
and skillful anticipatist in this section. While we do not wish to
wound by harsh criticism, we have no hesitation in saying and we
say it boldly that this lecture gave entire satisfaction to that
numerous class of our readers who like that kind of a lecture.
Still, we may be mistaken in this opinion and if so we are willing
to be corrected; we trust that like Mr. Heap we are "umble" and
would not venture to make so broad a declaration as the above
without offering to take it back if it did not prove satisfactory
to the intelligent readers of our widely-circulated and influential
J<font size="-1">OURNAL</font>.</p>

<p>We cannot better and less offensively sum up the merits of this
delightful, beautiful, eloquent, grand, extraordinary, lovely,
forcible, convincing, pious, exciting, splendid lecture than in the
one word with which the fascinating and fashionably-haired young
lady so fitly described Niagara Falls--<i>pretty</i>. It should
have been heard to be appreciated, &amp;c., &amp;c. Time and space
will not allow us to say anything about the lecture here and at
this time. We leave that disreputable task to the heartless wretch
who so audaciously refused to admire the transcendant merits of
Gough's temperance lecture and walk around. Those of our citizens
who did not attend missed a rare treat. (Lest our temperance
friends should be offended we explain that "treat" here does not
refer to anything ardent.) Mr. Twain entered fully into the spirit
of his performance. (Our readers who tie to spiritual
manifestations will take no offense at the word "spirit;" it is not
used in a supernatural sense.) To say this lecture was well
received is only the naked truth (no offense meant to our lady
readers by the term here applied to truth.) Mr. Twain's lecture
should be in every library, and on every centre table, and on every
faro table, and every bar, and in every livery stable, and in all
other places which deserve mention here; we hope we shall not be
deemed invidious in not naming them all.</p>

<p>We should be guilty of the blackest hearted ingratitude,
sacrilege, and inattention to a blessed institution did we neglect
to introduce in this connection a silver-plated puff on the Y. M.
C. A., and the managers of the lecture course. By bringing Mr.
Twain here they have conferred a great benefit on our people, have
given the prosperity of the place a substantial boost, have placed
us under renewed obligations to them, &amp;c., &amp;c. The citizens
will hold them in grateful memory and future generations will
inscribe their names</p>

<center><b>Mark Twain Criticised--An Indignant
Spectator.--</b></center>

<p>Mr. Editor.--As your paper professes to allow free criticism, I
wish you would give me a chance to pitch into Mark Twain's lecture.
I was one of the victims. I confess I did not comprehend his
lecture, as I did not the subject announced on the bills. "Our
fellow cannibals!" Now what does that mean? Cannibals are men who
eat folks, ain't they? And if they are our fellows it means <i>
we</i> eat folks too, if I understand it correctly, don't it? Is
this true? If not it is a slander on the people of this great and
enlightened nation.</p>

<p>Starting out with a theme that either is a falsehood, or else
means nothing, the whole lecture was the same. He commenced by <i>
introducing himself</i>--an unusual procedure and I believe an
undeserved slight on the lecture committee who were present and
ready to introduce him.</p>

<p>And then he proceeded to his lecture--and what did it amount to?
What new or valuable thing did he tell us of the Sandwich Islands?
What that we could not read at home? He says he has been there, but
he must have used his senses to little purpose if he could not pick
up more interesting facts than he narrated in his lecture. His
intimation that <i>civilization</i> was responsible for the
decrease of population there is another insult to America. And what
sense is there in describing a man as being <i>dressed in an
umbrella?</i> Like a fool, he omitted to tell what the personal
costume of the Islander is, only saying that it wouldn't take more
than a minute to tell it; if it was so easy to tell why omit it?
Where is the sense in referring to a thing and then telling nothing
about it? Then, could there be anything more disgusting than his
talk about the baked dogs? Well enough, perhaps, to explain that
the Islanders eat dogs, but why dwell on it with such gusto when he
said himself that he had no appetite for the dish? Did he suppose
<i>we</i> had, that he talked so about it?</p>

<p>In equally bad taste was his reference to cannibalism. That
incident about the poor old sea-captain who was so barbarously
devoured was of course affecting, but why need he introduce it
without giving the <i>moral</i> to it--especially as he said he
told it only for the moral that was in it? Is it not an evidence of
Twain's excessive stupidity that he could tell that story, as he
confessed, forty or fifty times without once giving the moral to
it.</p>

<p>And I think every intelligent person in the audience must have
felt insulted, actually insulted, at his telling about a man being
blown up out of sight and gone fifteen minutes and coming down in
the very same identical spot and going to work again and the
company docking him for 15 minutes lost time, expecting us to
believe it. I consider the story preposterously unlikely. I don't
doubt a company being mean enough to dock him, but could any man go
up and come down again and go right to work without stopping to
rest? Even if the story is true, I don't see what it has to do with
the Sandwich Islands. You complain that our glorious Gough
introduced matter foreign to his subject and yet say nothing about
this unwarranted, absurd digression of Twain's. It makes a
difference whose ox is gored, I notice!</p>

<p>And what sense was there in the lecturer's offering to
illustrate cannibalism if any one would send up a baby to the
platform. He knew perfectly well that in such an advanced community
as this, infants are not allowed in the lecture room. And even if
they were, did he suppose any mother would send up her child for
such a purpose. It is a significant comment on this proposition
that, inhuman as it was, it was the <i>only part</i> of his lecture
that was <i>strictly relevant</i> to the subject; have your readers
thought of that? It reveals the only glimmer of sense there is in
the expression "our fellow-cannibals." Mr. Twain may be correct in
using that expression for himself, but not in including others in
the barbarous imputation, as he does when he uses the pronoun
"<i>our</i>." He should announce as his theme, "<i>My</i>
fellow-cannibals."</p>

<p>Another disgusting thing was the conceited manner and egotism of
the speaker. He seemed to think himself smart, &amp;c., and did not
hesitate to boldly hint that he thought so. If he has any friends
they should tell him what a silly appearance he makes.</p>

<p>And so I might go on, showing the irrelevancy and senselessness
of nearly all his lecture. It was entirely worthless. I never was
so disappointed in a performance in my life. I went there expecting
to hear something thrilling and original about those interesting
islands and this trash was all he had to offer. Some silly young
people laughed, though what they could see to laugh at I don't
know. I felt more like hiding my head in shame, disgust, annoyance,
chagrin and mortification. I could not help thinking of our noble
missionaries in those far-away Islands, and how pained they would
feel when they came to know that the field of their labors had been
so abominably and jestingly represented here.</p>

<p>Instead of joining you in the opinion that our Lecture Committee
has won fame by getting Mark Twain here to lecture, I declare that
they have offended the good taste and religious scruples of the
sober portion of this community by introducing his ill-timed levity
and in this opinion I am sustained by nine-tenths of that portion
of the community. I therefore enter a solemn protest against Mark
Twain, and in behalf of the serious portion of this community, sign
myself,</p>

<p>M<font size="-1">ANY</font> C<font size="-1">ITIZENS</font>.</p>
