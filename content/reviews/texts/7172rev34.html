<center><b>Lecture of Mark Twain.</b></center>
<p>Mark Twain lectured to a fair audience in Arcadome Hall on last Saturday night. Failing to make connection at Crestline he hired an engine to bring him to Wooster.  He introduced his subject, "Roughing It," by a very humorous description of his trip from Crestline to Wooster.  The gentleman from Wooster, of regal appearance, who accompanied him and is said to have palmed himself off as the Grand Duke, enjoys the joke immensely, but denies its foundation in fact.</p>
<p>The lecture abounded in humorous and graphic description.  It was just such a production as might have been expected from the author of "Innocents Abroad."  Twain undoubtedly possesses a high faculty of vivid and lively description.</p>
<p>The Rev. O. H. Tiffany will lecture on Tuesday, the 16th of January.  Subject: "An Hour with Washington Irving."</p>
<p>This will be the third visit of Dr. Tiffany to Wooster.  His great reputation as a polished orator will doubtless call out a large audience.</p>
