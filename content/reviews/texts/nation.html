<h2>The Nation [unsigned]<br>
1869: September 2</h2>
</center>

<p>Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, who is known to many of us, and ought to
be known to all of us, as Mark Twain, was one of the passengers on
the <i>Quaker City</i> when she took her ill-assorted party of
excursionists to Europe and the East, and he has just given us, in
a thick book of more than six hundred pages, a record of the tour.
It might better have been a thinner book, for there is some dead
wood in it, as there has to be in all books which are sold by
book-agents and are not to be bought in stores. The rural-district
reader likes to see that he has got his money's worth even more
than he likes wood-engravings. At least, such is the faith in
Hartford; and no man ever saw a book-agent with a small volume in
his hand.</p>

<p>But if some of the book is needless, none of it is really poor,
and much of it very good. Mr. Clemens's plan of delivering an
unvarnished tale, of giving just his own impressions of what he
saw, at once made his work sure of some real value as well as much
freshness, and his book is one to be commended merely as a book of
travels. But, of course, the "American humor" is the great thing.
It is not in the light of a traveller that one regards a gentleman
who when during his wanderings in the Holy Land he comes upon the
"tomb of Adam," which the monks exhibit, thus gives utterance to a
natural burst of <a name="1">sentiment:</a></p>

53]</a></center>

<p>All the prominent characteristics of our peculiar school of
humorists -- their audacity, their extravagance and exaggeration --
Mr. Clemens displays in fulness in the course of his ramblings, and
he has some merits which belong to his individual self, and which
make him a very agreeable companion when he is at ease and natural
-- which is not always; for as he pads so, we must make free to
tell him, does he sometimes grimace, and is professionally a
humorist as he was professionally a book-maker. It will be a just
punishment for him to reflect that no doubt many a farmer will read
all his jokes -- the good ones as well as these bad ones we are
speaking to him about -- with profound gravity and unshaking belief
in them as so much serious log-book.</p>

<p>There is, besides those we have mentioned, another
characteristic of "American humor," which consists in a certain
sort of what may be called fatuousness. When the man in the
stage-coach, riding along with "the great moral showman" without
knowing him, kept on telling him, "some of Artemus Ward's jokes,"
and at the end of each one of them punched his companion in the
side and said, "What a damned fool the fellow is!" he was not the
worst critic that Artemus ever had. NearIy all his jokes have in
them a display of mental helplessness -- not to say imbecility -- a
drifting along of the mind from one topic to another, suggested but
not really connected, topic, and are largely dependent upon this
for their humorous effect. The same thing may be seen -- though not
nearly so unmixed nor so often -- in the efforts of Mr. Josh
Billings. The humor in the Nasby Papers consists rather in Mr.
Locke's conception of the low, "dough-face" Democrat than in
anything strictly humorous that is said or done by him after he is
made, and the Cross-roads pastor and postrmaster gives no
exhibition of the trait mentioned. But the author of <i>The
Innocents Abroad</i> has some of it -- though something of what he
has is acquired and imitative, we should say -- and may be taken to
be rather more nearly Artemus Ward's successor in this line than
either of the other humorists to whom we have referred.</p>
