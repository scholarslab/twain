<p><b>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font>
L<font size="-1">ECTURE.</font></b> -- White's Hall was filled from
cellar to garret, last night, by one of the best tickled audiences
that ever assembled there to hear a lecture or see the speaker.
Mark Twain tickled them. And he did it so easily and almost
consistently, that they didn't know what they were laughing at more
than half the time. Twain is witty, and his wit comes from his own
fertile brain. His style is original; and his manner of speaking is
not after the manner of men generally. His serious face and long
drawn words are, of themselves, sufficient to make one laugh, even
if there were not in every sentence expressed a sparkling gem of
humor, and original idea. His anecdotes, with which the lecture is
repleat, are rich, and, as he tells them, irresistibly funny. In
some of his descriptions of European places and characters the
lecturer delivers, at times, most eloquent passages, brilliant in
thought and word.</p>

<p>That M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font> is
a success as a lecturer, as well as writer, we think no one who
heard "The American Vandal Abroad," last night, will dispute.</p>
