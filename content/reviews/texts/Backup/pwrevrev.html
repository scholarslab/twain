<h2><i>The American Monthly Review of Reviews</i> [unsigned]<br>
1894: January</h2>

[<i>This isn't really a review of the novel, but it is interesting
as a first response to the story. A regular feature of</i> The
Review of Reviews <i>was "The Periodicals Reviewed," a summary of
some of the main articles in many American, British and French
magazines and quarterlies. The following is from the account of the
contents of</i> The Century<i>, written after the first installment
of</i> Pudd'nhead Wilson <i>had appeared there in December, 1893.
MT's novel ran in</i> The Century <i>until June, 1894, but for some
reason</i> The Review of Reviews <i>never discussed or mentioned
the story again. It would have been interesting to know what
"moral" about race the author of this comment felt the novel
finally pointed.</i>] <br>
<br>
 The feature of the number [i.e. the December <i>Century</i>] so
far as fiction is concerned is the beginning of Mark Twain's serial
novel, "Pudd'n Head Wilson," the scene of which is laid in
Southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago. The first chapters give
but small indication of that humor which made Mr. Clemens' fame.
Curiously enough, the plot, if one may presume to prophesy from the
first chapters, is going to center around the mixing up of two
babies, one of whom is a white child and the other a mulatto with a
slight strain of negro blood, the two being under the charge of the
fond mulatto mother; so that we may expect to find Mark Twain
drawing some healthy moral concerning the race problem before we
are through with "Pudd'n Head Wilson."
