<h2><i>Athenaeum</i> [unsigned]<br>
1884: December 27</h2>

<br>
<p>For some time past Mr. Clemens has been carried away by the
ambition of seriousness and fine writing. In <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i> he returns to his right mind, and is again the Mark Twain
of old time. It is such a book as he, and he only, could have
written. It is meant for boys; but there are few men (we should
hope) who, once they take it up, will not delight in it. It forms a
companion or sequel, to <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. Huckleberry Finn, as
everybody knows, is one of Tom's closest friends; and the present
volume is a record of the adventures which befell him soon after
the event which made him a person of property and brought Tom
Sawyer's story to a becoming conclusion. They are of the most
surprising and delightful kind imaginable, and in the course of
them we fall in with a number of types of character of singular
freshness and novelty, besides being schooled in half a dozen
extraordinary dialects -- the Pike County dialect in all its forms,
the dialect of the Missouri negro, and 'the extremest form of the
backwoods South-Western dialect,' to wit. Huckleberry, it may be
noted, is stolen by his disreputable father, to escape from whom he
contrives an appearance of robbery and murder in the paternal hut,
goes off in a canoe, watches from afar the townsfolk hunting for
his dead body, and encounters a runaway negro -- Miss Watson's Jim
-- an old particular friend of Tom Sawyer and himself. With Jim he
goes south down the river, and is the hero of such scrapes and
experiences as make your mouth water (if you have ever been a boy)
to read of them. We do not purpose to tell a single one; it would
be unfair to author and reader alike. We shall content ourselves
with repeating that the book is Mark Twain at his best, and
remarking that Jim and Huckleberry are real creations, and the
worthy peers of the illustrious Tom Sawyer.</p>
