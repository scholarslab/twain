 <b><font size="+1">THE TWAIN -- IN OTHER WORDS THE CLEMENS-CABLE
COMBINATION.</font></b><br>


<p>[Transcribed from Pond's <a href="tourad.jpg">broadside
poster</a>.]</p>

<p>The scene at the "front of the house" in Whitney's last night
was enough to make glad the heart of a manager. The sharp cries of
"one, two, one, three" of the head usher rang out as he turned the
well-dressed stream in ones and twos to the under-ushers. He stood
like a rock at the head of the centre aisle and the stream poured
in on him. It surged around him, but calm and immovable he stood,
and it broke around him. He utilized it and turned the steam into
rivulets that trickled down the different aisles like the separate
arms of the delta of the great river beside which the Twain authors
won their fame. The stream went in graceful cascades down the steps
of the different channels into the parquet and innundated it. The
theatre was a sea of faces.</p>

<p>The stage setting for this drama by two was of a nature
calculated to inspire the authors with wonder at the wealth and
splendor of Detroit interiors. Could Hartford insure a lovelier
blue satin parlor suite? Could New Orleans exhibit a more gorgeous
table-cover with a redder embroidered rose? The doors at the back
were twain, and the lace hung in cables over the middle
entrance.</p>

<p>A man, whose shadow was now and then projected against the
wings, snapped on the footlight gas. Then with a crack the overhead
illumination flooded the stage with light, and a third thrill
awaited the audience when the same invisible magician with the
lightning touch sprang the big chandelier into a dazzling
combination of jets. "It is like the President at Washington
starting the exhibition in the South to-day," said a lady to her
escort.</p>

<p>These little electric excitements led up the audience to the
event of the evening -- the entrance of the great American
novelist, the humorist leading slightly, as they say in sporting
circles. The sensation that had been caused by a brilliant-headed
stage boy coming in and moving one of the blue chairs up to the
footlights had subsided, and when the real actors came on there was
a grand burst of applause. Mark Twain, drifting round the table to
the front, leaving Cable kind of straddled on the other side,
drawled out:</p>

<p>"Lays sun gen'lmen, I introduce to you Mr. Caaa-ble."</p>

<p>And with a wave of his hand he left his partner before the
multidude, and retired R.E.</p>

<p>Mr. Cable looked down into the empty orchestra and saw on the
chairs where the fiddlers used to sit a motley array of overcoats
and sacques that showed him plainly that he was not in the balmy
climate of the sunny South. Then he lifted his face, and the
audience got a good, square look at him.</p>

<p>His make-up was good. The wrinkiles on his brows looked for all
the world as if he had been for years in constant surprise at his
own success. His whiskers were long and pointed, and they ran up
his cheek on either side until they met the smooth black hair. A
person had the uncomfortable feeling that perhaps they were held in
place by a string concealed over the top of his head, and that they
might at any moment drop off. His moustaches were of the St. John
(not the Evangelist, but the Prohibitionist) type, and their parted
ends drooped down to a level with his pointed beard -- three
peculiar points about Cable.</p>

<p>He seemed just a trifle like a nervous man who had got his
nervousness under pretty good control, but couldn't quite make up
his mind whether it was better to keep his hands clasped behind his
dress-coat, or in front of it with his thumbs up.</p>

<p>The first Cable dispatch was that exquisite conversation between
Narcisse and the Richlings, where the former tries to get John to
"baw" him some of the cash Dr. Sevier has placed to the credit of
the unfortunate couple.</p>

<p>"I wuz juz coming at yo' 'ouse, Mistoo Itchlin. Yesseh, I wuz
juz sitting in my 'oom afteh dinneh, envelop'in in my <i>'obe de
chambre</i>, when all at once I says to myself, 'Faw distwaction I
will go and see Mistoo Itchlin.'" It was distraction indeed to the
Richlings. He saw "Mistoo Itchlin" in every sense of the word, and
"baw'd" the last cent he had.</p>

<p>If Mr. Cable would come on the stage and sit down on the chair
and have a good actor do the talking there might be some
improvement. There was a touch here and there of amateurishness and
a certain self-consciousness that rather interfered with the
recital. Still, it is doubtful if any one could have given the
Creole dialect as well as Cable himself.</p>

<p>In retiring, amidst most enthusiastic applause, he took three
backward steps, made a bow, three more, then another bow, three
more, and out.</p>

<p>There was no burst of music between the acts. The overcoats and
things occupied the orchestra chairs with discretion and silence.
This, of course, gave Mark a great advantage. The people were in
good humor from the start.</p>

<p>"Mark the Perfect Man," saith the quotation. For "man" read
"humorist." Nothing could be more deliciously droll than his very
movement toward that embroidered tablecloth. He came in with his
head forward and looked like a man who had lost something on the
stage and wasn't exactly sure that he would be able to find it.
When he faced the music -- or rather the place where the music used
to be -- he looked at the audience with a puzzled, half-careworn
expression, as if he had met the people before, but couldn't just
at the moment recall their names. His half-closed eyes appeared to
peer out from under the bushy eyebrows with a puzzled gaze that had
been regarding life seriously for forty odd years, and couldn't
quite make it out. His bristly, plentiful hair was brushed back as
if he had been born that way. It looked as if it never could become
towsled up or come down over his eyes, and it was tinged with gray.
It seems incredible that Mark Twain should ever have gray hair, but
such are the indications.</p>

<p>His left hand automatically sought his trousers pocket, and slid
in there, leaving the thumb at liberty.</p>

<p>He told his stories with that inimitable Down East drawl of his,
and took his audience into his confidence with a serious
unconventionality that was most delightful. When he got through he
ambled off the stage with a little trot that was as funny as his
altogether diffident entrance. He reminds one in his serious fun
remotely of Raymond in "Mulberry Sellers." He also reminds you of
someone you have seen before, you can't tell who, but you are
friends with him, for old acquaintance sake, from the first. The
audience laughed so heartily at his stories that laughing became a
pain, and then, as Saxe says, "Cable like a poultice came, to heal
the blows of Twain."</p>

<p>The Creole songs that Cable sang in place of one of his
recitations were enthusiastically encored.</p>

<p>Mr. Cable should give up the funny business entirely to Twain.
He should stick to the serious parts of his book with the exception
of Narcisse, and let Mark bring the laughter. He is enough and
several to spare.</p>

<p>"Mary's Night Ride" was most graphically given by Mr. Cable. He
brought the picture vividly before the eyes of his audience and
held them spell-bound to the last word. It was the very perfection
of intense word-painting. Still he should have shot that navy six a
little quicker. The "once--twice--thrice" should have been given
with every spring of the flying horse. "The tart rejoinders of his
navy six" rang out in the night air, you may depend on it, Mr.
Cable, as quickly as the brave spy could pull the trigger, and by
the way, that sentence, "The tart rejoinders of his navy six," is
one of the most graphic ever penned by the hand of man.</p>

<p>Twain gave his version of the celebrated
st---st---st---st---whe-e-w-a--ammering story, which differs from
that of Col. Sellers, and is infinitely better than Raymond's way
of it.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be said that while the stage settings had
somewhat of a sameness in them to a people educated up to the
scenery of the "Silver King" and such, still the combination must
save a good deal in baggage cars, and if we missed the background
of the Alps while Twain was in his "Trying Situation," or "The
Street in New Orleans" while Ristofalo was before us, we should
remember that our loss was their gain. Taking it from first to last
the Twain-Cable entertainment was by all odds the most enjoyable
thing of the season, a sweet boon to the tired theatre-goer and a
joy forever to the callous cynical man in the box office. When
shall we, Twain, meet again?</p>
