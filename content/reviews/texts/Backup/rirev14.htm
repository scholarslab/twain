<p>Our inveterate American humorist here relates a tissue of vagabond adventures in a
  mingled yarn of fancy and fact, during a residence at various points on the Pacific coast in
  the early days of the chase for gold and silver.  His book, he assures us, contains "quite a good deal of information," which he very much regrets, but it
  could not be helped, as "information appears to stew out of him naturally, like the
  precious ottar of roses out of the otter."  He not only deals in his off-hand way with all
  kinds of information, whether true or otherwise, but favors his readers with frequent
  expressions of his personal opinions, which are usually novel, if nothing else.  His
  excuse, for polygamy, for instance, is decidedly original, and leaves little more to be said
  on <a name="k">the subject.</a> </p>

<blockquote>Our stay in</a> Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and 
therefore we had no time to make the customary inquisition into 
the workings of polygamy and get up the usual statistics and 
deductions preparatory to calling the attention of the nation at 
large once more to the matter.  
I had the will to do it.  With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I 
was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform 
here--until I saw the Mormon women.  Then I was touched.  My 
heart was wiser than my head.  It warmed toward these  
poor, ungainly and pathetically "homely" creatures, and as I turned 
to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I said, "No--the man that 
marries one of them has done an act of Christian charity which 
entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their harsh 
censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of 
open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand 
uncovered in his presence and worship in  
silence."</blockquote>

<p>His facetious sketches of Nevada life are shaded by an occasional touch of <a name="l">grim humor.</a></p>

<blockquote>The ways of silver mining Boards are exceedingly dark and 
sinuous.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>We took up various claims, and  
<i>commenced</i> shafts and  
tunnels on them, but never finished any of them.  We 
had to do a certain amount of work on each to "hold" it, else other 
parties could seize our property after the expiration of ten days.  
We were always hunting up new claims and doing a little work on 
them and then waiting for a buyer--who never came.  We never 
found any ore that would yield more than fifty dollars a ton; and as 
the mills charged fifty dollars a ton for  
<i>working</i> ore and extracting  
the silver, our pocket-money melted steadily 
away and none returned to take its place.  We lived in a little cabin 
and cooked for ourselves; and altogether it was a hard life, though 
a hopeful one--for we never ceased to expect fortune and a 
customer to burst upon us some day.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>At last, when flour reached a dollar a pound, and money could 
not be borrowed on the best security at less  
than <i>eight per cent a month</i> (I  
being without the security, too), I abandoned mining and went 
to milling.  That is to say, I went to work as a common laborer in a 
quartz mill, at ten dollars a week and board.</blockquote>

<p>The wild barbaric life of
  the primitive California miner is embalmed in the author's <a name="m">undiluted descriptions:</a></p>

<blockquote>But they were rough in those times!  They fairly reveled in 
gold, whisky, fights, and fandangoes, and were unspeakably happy.  
The honest miner raked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out 
of his claim a day, and what with the gambling dens and the other 
entertainments, he hadn't a cent the next morning, if he had any sort of luck.  They cooked 
their own bacon and beans, sewed on their own buttons, washed 
their own shirts--blue woollen ones; and if a man wanted a fight on 
his hands without any annoying delay, all he had to do was to 
appear in public in a white shirt or a stove-pipe hat, and he would 
be accommodated.  For those people hated aristocrats.  They had a 
particular and malignant animosity toward what they called a 
"biled shirt."</blockquote>

<p>One particular feature of that grotesque society was the absence of <a name="n">women and children.</a></p>

<blockquote>In those days</a> miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse 
of that rare and blessed spectacle, a woman!  Old inhabitants tell 
how, in a certain camp, the news went abroad early in the morning 
that a woman was come!  They had seen a calico dress hanging out 
of a wagon down at the camping-ground--sign of emigrants from 
over the great plains.  Everybody went down there, and a shout 
went up when an  
actual, bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the wind!  The 
male emigrant was visible.  The miners said:</blockquote> 
<blockquote>"Fetch her out!"</blockquote> 
<blockquote>He said: "It is my wife, gentlemen--she is sick--we have been 
robbed of money, provisions, everything, by the Indians--we want 
to rest."</blockquote> 
<blockquote>"Fetch her out!  We've got to see her!"</blockquote> 
<blockquote>"But, gentlemen, the poor thing, she--"</blockquote> 
<blockquote>"FETCH HER OUT!"</blockquote> 
<blockquote>He "fetched her out," and they swung their hats and sent up 
three rousing cheers and a tiger; and they crowded around and 
gazed at her, and touched her dress, and listened to her voice with 
the look of men who listened to  
a <i>memory</i> rather than a present  
reality--and then they collected twenty-five 
hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man, and swung their 
hats again and gave three more cheers, and went home 
satisfied.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>Once I dined in San Francisco with the family of a pioneer, 
and talked with his daughter, a young lady whose first experience 
in San Francisco was an adventure, though she herself did not 
remember it, as she was only two or three years old at the time.  
Her father said that, after landing from the ship, they were walking 
up the street, a servant leading the party with the little girl in her 
arms.  And presently  
a huge miner, bearded, belted, spurred, and bristling with deadly 
weapons--just down from a long campaign in the mountains, 
evidently-barred the way, stopped the servant, and stood gazing, 
with a face all alive with gratification and astonishment.  Then he 
said, reverently:</blockquote> 
<blockquote>"Well, if it ain't a child!"  And then he snatched a little leather 
sack out of his pocket and said to the servant:</blockquote> 
<blockquote>"There's a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and I'll give 
it to you to let me kiss the child!"</blockquote> 
<blockquote>That anecdote is <i>true</i>.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>But see how things change.  Sitting at that dinner-table, 
listening to that anecdote, if I had offered double the money for the 
privilege of kissing the same child, I would have been refused.  
Seventeen added years have far more than doubled the price.</blockquote> 

<p>The present volume may be regarded as
  one of the most racy specimens of Mark Twain's savory pleasantries, and their effect is
  aggravated by the pictoral illustrations which swarm on every page, many of which are no
  less comical than the letter-press.</p>
