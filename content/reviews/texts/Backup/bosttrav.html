<h2><i>Boston Evening Traveller</i>[unsigned]<br>
 1885: March 5</h2>

<br>


<p>It is little wonder that Mr. Samuel Clemens, otherwise Mark
Twain, resorted to real or mock lawsuits, as may be, to restrain
some real or imaginary selling of "The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn" as a means of advertising that extraordinarily senseless
publication. Before the work is disposed of, Mr. Mark Twain will
probably have to resort to law to compel some to sell it by any
sort of bribery or corruption. It is doubtful if the edition could
be disposed of to people of average intellect at anything short of
the point of the bayonet. This publication rejoices in two
frontispieces, of which the one is supposed to be a faithful
portrait of Huckleberry Finn, and the other an engraving of the
classic features of Mr. Mark Twain as seen in the bust made by Karl
Gerhardt. The taste of this gratuitous presentation is as bad as is
the book itself, which is an extreme statement. Mr. Clemens has
contributed some humorous literature that is excellent and will
hold its place, but his Huckleberry Finn appears to b e singularly
flat, stale and unprofitable. The book is sold by subscription.</p>
