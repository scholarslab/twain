<p>T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font> L<font size=
"-1">ECTURE.</font>--Mark Twain was greeted Saturday evening by an
audience that any man might be proud of. With a condition of
streets that under ordinary circumstances would keep people by
their firesides, Doolittle Hall was more completely filled than we
remember ever to have seen it before on the occasion of a lecture.
In fact, there was not sitting room enough, and the aisles were
pretty well filled with chairs and benches. Twain appeared pretty
punctually, attended by the chairman and a member of the lecture
committee, both of whom he unceremoniously dismissed from the stage
and took the programme into his own hands. After announcing the
next lecture of the course by Prof. Winchell, on the "Stone Folk,"
under which head, as Twain remarked, the Cardiff Giant is included,
Twain introduced himself in the following highly unique manner:</p>

<p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>.--The <i>next</i> lecture of the
course will be delivered this evening by Samuel L. Clemens,
otherwise Mark Twain, a gentleman whose high character and
unimpeachable integrity are only equalled by his comeliness of
person and grace of manner. And I am the man. You will excuse me
for introducing myself, for I have just excused the chairman from
introducing me. I know it's not the ordinary way, but the fact is I
never yet have found a chairman of a lecture committee who was
equal to the task of introducing me as I ought to be
introduced."</p>

<p>This decidedly original introduction was greeted with shouts of
laughter and is a fair specimen of the vein in which the lecture on
"Our Fellow Savages of the Sandwich Islands" was delivered. It was
a good sample of his style of humor, and threw the audience into
frequent convulsions of laughter. Twain is a fair looking model of
humanity, and his manner is sufficient to provoke a smile. He talks
with great deliberation and brings out his words with a nasal
accent long drawn out which smacks of Yankeeism. Twain has roamed
over the world considerable, and wherever the ridiculous side of
human nature sticks out he has not failed to see and remember it.
He is a humorist in the radical sense of the word, and his wit
crystallizes around an atom of fun and makes it sparkle like a
diamond.</p>

<p>The lecture committee have given us two heavy lectures--Duryea's
and Tilton's--and Twain's was thrown in at just the right nick of
time to make the course rest a little easier on our stomachs, so to
speak--like the wine after dinner.</p>
