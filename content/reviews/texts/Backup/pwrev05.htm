<p>Mark Twain's <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson and Those Extraordinary
  Twins</i> which he is pleased to term a tragedy and a comedy respectively are
  published together with lavish marginal illustrations.  These pictures are the most
  praiseworthy feature of the volume, although they vary considerably.  The
  author was not at his best when he wrote these stories.  They are funny, and now and then
  very funny.  But a coarse streak comes to the surface every little while and is
  disagreeable.  The book is handsomely gotten up by the publishers and does them credit,
  but we cannot commend the stories which compose it to our readers very heartily.</p>
