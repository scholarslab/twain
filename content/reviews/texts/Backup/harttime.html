<h2><i>Hartford Daily Times</i> [unsigned]<br>
1876: December 20</h2>

<p>The American Publishing company of this city have just issued
Mark Twain's book, "Tom Sawyer." It is a beautiful book, both
outside and in, as one might naturally expect to find it on seeing
the imprint of this publishing house upon it--a house that has
established a well-earned reputation in the book publishing lines.
The illustrations in the book are of a merit beyond praise. They
are of the eloquent kind that speak for themselves, as well as for
the print they illustrate. Those who imagine this to be a tame
story for little boys will discover their mistake on reading it. It
is safe to predict that no one will read the first page without
reading all the rest. There is a power of attraction about it that
doesn't "let up," but grows stronger to the end. Though claiming to
be a book for boys and girls it will not be monopolized by them.
There's rich entertainment in it for both young and old. The author
says most of the adventures recorded in it really occurred, and
that one or two of them were his own. Perhaps his well-known
modesty forbids his claiming any larger proportion. The story dates
back some forty years ago, in one of the southwestern slave states.
The hero, Tom Sawyer, is a unique individual, to state it mildly.
The author says he belongs to the composite order of architecture.
Perhaps that is as good a description of him as can be given in
brief. He isn't one of the orthodox boys who love their Sunday
schools, and love to read about the good little boys who die early
and go to heaven. He evidently preferred the other place where they
don't have any Sunday schools, and the boys don't have to keep
quiet every seventh day in the week. He doesn't believe in early
deaths, nor early piety. Tom is a reckless, daredevil fellow, ready
to hazard life for an adventure any time; but under the rollicking
air of the book there appears an occasional bit of philosophy in
the peculiarly dry, sarcastic vein of the author, as this, for <a
name="3">instance</a>:<br>

The following, especially the account of the fly's toilet is
particularly <a name="5">good</a>: <br>

During the sermon that followed--a sermon that thinned the elect
down to a company so small as to be "hardly worth the saving"--Tom
had further interesting adventures which helped to give variety and
keep awake "other people uninterested in the sermon" as well as
himself. 

<p>The account, some chapters further along, of the village school
graduating exercises, and the prize poems and compositions of the
young ladies, is racy and rich, but not in the least exaggerated.
Its beauty consists in its truth to life. The slim, melancholy
girl, with a cast of countenance "that comes of pills and
indigestion," who reads a poem as indigestible as her ordinary
diet, is to be found in any average school of the present day, as
can likewise be found her bilious companion who reads a composition
which "wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to
non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize."</p>

<p>Perhaps the most pointed paragraph in the book is the following
in relation to a petition for pardon for a <a name="6">
murderer</a>:<br>

<p>If there is any defect in the book it is in the love scenes,
where a boy of Tom Sawyer's size wanders off to be an outlaw. This
part is a little overdrawn. But the whole story is so exquisitely
told that the book will be widely sought. It is a capital gift for
the holidays.</p>
