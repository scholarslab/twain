 <b><font size="+1">TWAIN AND CABLE.</font><br>
A Splendid House Meets Tham on Their First Appearance</b><br>
<br>
 Ennuied theater-goers, sated with "patent insides" plays like
somebody or other's Confectionery, the Work-house Convict, Stuffed
Doll, Skipped by Daylight, Consternation, and similar productions,
found infinite relief last night listening to the readings given by
Mark Twain and Geo. W. Cable. They must have felt flattered by the
audience that greeted them, for, in addition to being of goodly
size, it was made up of the best of society people. Cable was the
first to appear. He is small, dapper, and so slight that his dress
suit clings rather than fits to his frame. After being introduced
he seated himself at one of the tables on the stage and waited
until the late comers had been shown their chairs. His colorless
face, encircled with abundance of dark hair, did not suggest
risible tendencies, and his long pointed beard, suggestive of a
cheap stage make-up for the villain's part, was also against his
present calling. Taken altogether, he had the look of an overworked
student who was cultivating brain at the expense of physique. When
silence obtained he came forward and began the entertainment in a
disappointing voice, for it was weak, effeminate, and thin, and had
a metallic quality that could scarcely be called agreeable.
Throughout the evening his selections were entirely from one of his
own works, the name of which was prominently displayed at the
beginning of every one of his numbers on the programme, the text
following it in smaller type. Either the man is infatuated with his
own work or takes this means of bolstering its sale. Ill-advisors
have put him forward as a humorist lecturer when the pathetic is
far better suited to his abilities. On several occasions this fact
was proved, and in "Mary's Night Ride" he reached a point bordering
on the tragic. As he reached the climax in this selection his words
were delivered with a dramatic effect so thrilling as to send cold
chills through every listener. He was heartily applauded for this
and had to answer a recall, as on a former occasion, when he gave
three quaint little creole songs, of singular and haunting tune.
Reciting the English words first, he followed with the Creole
patois original in a wierdly musical voice. In strong contrast to
Mr. Cable, Mark Twain is tall, awkward, gestureless, with a shock
head of iron-gray hair and a deeply-furrowed, tired face. With all
these rostrum disadvantages, he enters upon the stage,
nevertheless, with the self-possessed ease of a man passing into
his own drawing-room. The look upon his features suggests that he
has mislaid his eye-glasses and has returned to look for them.
Finding a number of persons present, he stops and has a long talk
with them, during which they are the most willing listeners in the
world. To describe his voice is almost next to impossible. Persons
who have heard Frank Mayo can form something like an idea of its
peculiarities. It is a thoroughly down East nasal tone, flowing
with the steadiness of a brook in words that, though scarcely
separated, are perfectly distinct and rich in their delicious
drollery. There is not a sentence but what conceals a
mirth-provoker of some kind, that jumps out at the most unexpected
time and place. Concluding his remarks, he ambles off the stage
with a funny little trot, as if he was wild to get out of sight as
soon as possible to have a roar all by himself.

<p>Last night's programme will be repeated this afternoon. To-night
will be given the closing entertainment, at which the programme
will be --</p>

<b><font size="+1">ANOTHER DELIGHTED AUDIENCE.</font><br>
Twain and Cable Close Their Season in Cincinnati</b><br>
<br>
 There was another fine audience at the Odeon last evening to hear
Mark Twain and George W. Cable on their last appearance in this
city. Mr. Cable was first to appear, at eight o'clock, when he read
an interesting humorous selection from Dr. Sevier, which was
applauded so enthusiastically that he continued the story. Mark
Twain then commenced to tell how he was interviewed in such a
humorous way that his audience at first thought he was only telling
something incidentally before he began his reading. In his next
selection he read a chapter of his unpublished book "Huckleberry
Finn," explaining how "Huck" and "Tom Sawyer" freed the runaway
"nigger," which created roars of laughter. He concluded his part of
the programme with the most side-splitting part of the
entertainment, an incident detailing his duelling experience in the
West. The audience fairly roared during the recital.

<p>Mr. Cable's second number on the programme indicated that he
would give a selection from the "Grandissime," but he substituted
another scene from Dr. Sevier, which the audience seemed to enjoy.
He became highly dramatic in this scene. In his closing selection
he, with the consent of the audience, rendered two of his weird
Creole songs instead of another -- "Mary's Night Ride" -- from Dr.
Sevier. The lecturers' engagement in this city has been a success
financially, and the entertainments have been highly satisfactory
to all who attended.</p>
