<h2><i>Athenaeum</i> [unsigned]<br>
1876: June 24</h2>

<p>The name of Mark Twain is known throughout the length and
breadth of England. Wherever there is a railway-station with a
bookstall his jokes are household words. Those whose usual range in
literature does not extend beyond the sporting newspapers, the <i>
Racing Calendar,</i> and the "Diseases of Dogs," have allowed him a
place with Artemus Ward alongside of the handful of books which
forms their library. For ourselves, we cannot dissociate him from
the railway-station, and his jokes always rise in our mind with a
background of Brown &amp; Polson's Corn Flour and Taylor's system
of removing furniture. We have read <i>The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer</i> with different surroundings, and still have been made to
laugh; and that ought to be taken as high praise. Indeed, the
earlier part of the book is, to our thinking, the most amusing
thing Mark Twain has written. The humour is not always uproarious,
but it is always genuine and sometimes almost pathetic, and it is
only now and then that the heartiness of a laugh is spoilt by one
of those pieces of self-consciousness which are such common blots
on Mark Twain's other books. <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> is
an attempt in a new direction. It is consecutive, and much longer
than the former books, and as it is not put forward as a mere
collection of <i>Screamers,</i> we laugh more easily, and find some
relief in being able to relax the conventional grin expected from
the reader of the little volumes of railway humour. The present
book is not, and does not pretend to be a novel, in the ordinary
sense of the word; it is not even a story, for that presupposes a
climax and a finish; nor is it a mere boys' book of adventures. In
the Preface the author says, "Although my book is intended mainly
for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be
shunned by men and women on that account, for part of my plan has
been to try pleasantly to remind adults of what they once were
themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what
queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in." Questions of
intention are always difficult to decide. The book will amuse
grown-up people in the way that humorous books written for children
have amused before, but (perhaps fortunately) it does not seem to
us calculated to carry out the intention here expressed. With
regard to the style, of course there are plenty of slang words and
racy expressions, which are quite in place in the conversations,
but it is just a question whether it would not have been as well if
the remainder of the book had not been written more uniformly in
English.</p>
