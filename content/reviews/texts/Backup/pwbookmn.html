<h2><i>The Bookman</i> [unsigned]<br>
1895: January 7</h2>

<p>Every scientific experiment or discovery of direct human import
is soon followed by fiction of which it forms the basis. That the
finger-print method of identification has not sooner provided the
matter of a tale is surprising. Mark Twain uses it here
ingeniously. "Pudd'nhead" is another name for fool; it is applied
hastily to Mr. David Wilson, a lawyer and surveyor, who in his
leisure hours amuses himself with making "records" of the finger
tips of his acquaintances. In the case of two children born on the
same day, and bearing a strong resemblance to each other, one a
child of consequence, the other the child of a slave girl, he made
continuous records. Then one of them, the wrong one of course, was
sold with the slave mother. The reader can develop the story from
that point, or if not, Mark Twain will do it for him. As the
mistake lasts for twenty-three hard years, in spite of Pudd'nhead
Wilson's cleverness, the end is prevented from being a very
cheerful one.</p>
