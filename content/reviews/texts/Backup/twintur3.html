Academy.</font></b><br>
<br>
 Mark Twain and George W. Cable appeared at the Academy of Music
last night in the presence of a small but delighted audience. The
programme was made up of selections from the writings of the two
well-known authors. Mr. Cable's readings were from his recent
novel, Dr. Sevier, and were listened to with the greatest interest.
Mr. Cable has a clear and distinct voice and speaks with almost
painful slowness, putting a careful emphasis on each syllable and
apparently weighing well all his utterances. He does not possess a
commanding stage presence, nor is his voice particularly strong,
yet the modesty of his demeanor makes a good impression and he
makes friends as he proceeds. With Mark Twain it is different. The
celebrated humorist is no less modest than his younger confrere,
but he is more at home on the stage. He walks on with a careless
shambling gait, tells the most uproariously funny stories in his
inimitable way, without the faintest shadow of a smile crossing his
countenance, and retires with the same air of careless
indifference. His selections from the advance sheets of his new
story, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," were heartily
received, but it was not until he gave his "Tragic Tale of a
Fishwife," leading up to it with an exquisitely humorous
description of the difficulties he encountered in an attempt to
master the grammar of the German language, that the audience fully
appreciated his quaint drollery. The laughter was incessant and it
increased in force as he graphically described his meeting with an
acquaintance whom he had forgotten, but who remembered him. His
terrible mental agony was depicted with all the force of the
genuine humorist, and drew forth roars of laughter. Mr. Cable
rendered a number of Creole songs and recited "Mary's Night Ride"
with remarkable dramatic intensity. Before commencing the
recitation he said that the story of the life of <i>John</i> and
<i>Mary Richling</i> had been told him by a friend. <i>Mary's</i>
home had been in Milwaukee, and it was to Milwaukee she had come in
the midst of her trouble, leaving her husband to battle so manfully
alone in New Orleans. It was from Milwaukee she started out so
bravely to reach her husband in the trying times of the war. He had
looked forward to a visit to the city which had been the home of
his heroine, with a hope that he might grasp the hand of that noble
woman. Following is the programme for to-night:<br>
