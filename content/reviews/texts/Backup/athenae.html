<h2><i>The Athenaeum</i> [British; unsigned]<br>
1870: September 24</h2>
</center>

<p>But for <a href="hingston.html">the Introduction to this
book</a>, we should have little difficulty in assigning it its
proper place in literature. We should say at once that the author
was draping himself in the garb of one of those typical Yankee
tourists of whom we hear so often, and whom we do meet
occasionally, -- the tourists who "do" Europe in six weeks, --
whose comment on Venice is that they do not care much for those old
towns, and on the Venus de' Medici that they do not like them stone
gals. If we thought at all about the name on the title-page, we
should put it down as a pseudonym, though the probability is that
we should not think about it. Anyhow, we should come to the
conclusion that Mark Twain, whoever he might be, had hit off the
oddities of some of his countrymen very well; that many of his
remarks were amusing, and almost witty; and that he was certainly
not such a fool as he tried to look. But when Mr. Hingston tells us
seriously that Mark Twain is really the pseudonym of the sub-editor
of a daily paper in a Western city a few months old, that he is a
flower of the wilderness, a thoroughly untravelled American
applying the standard of Nevada to historical Europe, we are fairly
puzzled. We can readily believe that the writer of this book is
ignorant of many of those things which would be familiar to an
English tourist. His remark that "Raphael, Angelo, Canova -- giants
like these gave birth to the designs" of the statues on the
Cathedral at Milan, is not much more than the hasty generalization
of one who takes his facts from guides and guide-books. The
statement that "Raphael pictured such infernal villains as
Catherine de' Medici seated in heaven and conversing familiarly
with the Virgin Mary and the angels," may surprise those who
remember that Catherine de' Medici was only born one year before
the death of Raphael. Again, we are told that Raphael is buried in
Santa Croce, instead of in the Pantheon; but we may conclude from
this that in Mark Twain's opinion every great artist should be
buried in several places, just as each relic of a saint is
multiplied. We owe this suggestion to what Mark Twain says of an
important fellow-passenger calling himself Commissioner of the
United States of America to Europe, Asia, and Africa. The comment
on this "titular avalanche" is, "to my thinking, when the United
States considered it necessary to send a dignitary of that tonnage
across the ocean, it would be in better taste and safer to take him
apart and cart him over in sections in several ships."</p>

<p>In all these mistakes there is nothing unnatural. Most men who
are not learned, and who do not take the precaution of using books
of reference before they speak, may fall into the same errors. The
only thing that characterizes Mark Twain is the reckless manner in
which he makes his assertions. The greater his blunder, the more
assurance there is in his language. Thus he says, without the
slightest reserve, that the Emperor of the French "kept his
faithful watch and walked his weary beat as a common policeman of
London" as if the special constable of 1848 had been Z 264. Yet it
is not till we get beyond the mistakes that we light on the genuine
untravelled American. It is significant of him that he does not
commit himself to facts of his own, because he is sceptical as to
the existence of everything. He listens gravely to the guide's
stories, and then asks some question which reduces them to an
absurdity. He finds everybody else admiring a picture, and that is
enough to set him against it. By putting a number of exaggerations
together he deprives any little grain of truth of its value. This
is the man who, in the present volume, remarks that the Italians
spell a word Vinci and pronounce it Vinchy, adding calmly,
"foreigners always spell better shall they pronounce." He, too,
when shown the writing of Christopher Columbus observes, "Why, I
have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could write
better than that. You mustn't think you can impose on us because we
are strangers. We are not fools by a good deal. If you have got any
specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out, and if you
haven't, drive on!" There are a good many comments on pictures from
the same point of view. Take this on the characters of Sacred Art:
"When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to
heaven, with a human skull beside him and without other baggage, we
know that is St. Jerome; because we know that he always went flying
light in the matter of baggage. When we see a party looking
tranquilly up to heaven, unconscious that his body is shot through
and through with arrows, we know that that is St. Sebastian. When
we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but <i>having
no trade-mark,</i> we always ask who those parties are." Another
question on which the untravelled American is worth hearing is the
ubiquity of guides, with their constant repetition of legends and
their unceasing exaggeration. At Gibraltar one story was dinned
into the tourist's ear, till at last he exclaimed to the narrator,
"Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land; have pity on me."
One supposed safeguard against invention is that a guide "would
hardly try so hazardous an experiment as the telling of a falsehood
when it is all he can do to speak the truth in English without
getting the lockjaw." But even this seems to have failed in Rome,
if we may judge from the following tirade against the mythical
being to whom the guides give the name of Michael <a name="1">
Angelo:</a></p>

27]</a></center>

<p>This last touch is exactly characteristic of the untravelled
American. In other places, however, the exaggeration to which Mark
Twain gives way shows that he is consciously acting a part. We do
not like him any the worse for that, and without the preface we
should have been easily reconciled to his eccentricities. His
incidental remarks about things in general are sufficiently
humorous to ensure his book a hearing, though they have the
misfortune to contradict Mr. Hingston's theory. The genuine Yankee
tourist would never sneer at one of his fellow countrymen for
ignorance of French manners and assumption of native superiority.
When Mark Twain finds an American proclaiming his nationality in
this offensive way -- "I am a freeborn sovereign, Sir, an American,
Sir, and I want everybody to know it" -- he adds, "the fellow did
not mention that he was a lineal descendant of Balaam's ass, but
everybody knew that without his telling it." Does this come under
the rule of <i>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</i> We think not. In our
opinion Mark Twain is merely showing the prevalence of the faults
which he satirizes. He wishes to remind us that, whether we take
Mr. Hingston's view or the more natural one, he is not the only
untravellcd American in his party, and that he is always on the
look-out for incidents which may serve his purpose. In this respect
Mark Twain's travels remind us of <i>The Book of Snobs,</i> where
the fancy picture of the author wholly eclipsed his characters.</p>
