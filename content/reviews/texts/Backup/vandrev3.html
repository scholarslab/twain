<center><b>Mark Twain.</b></center>

<p>Last evening Young Men's Hall was densely crowded with one of
the largest audiences of the season, to listen to Mark Twain in his
new <i>role</i> of comic lecturer. Of course all were intensely
amused at his droll sayings, but it is perhaps safe to say that his
capabilities as a writer are far in advance of his powers as a
lecturer. The lecture itself was decidedly good, but its delivery
was not what might have been expected, an assumed drawl, though
very taking and appropriate at times, spoiling the effect of many
of the finest sentences. Some of the more serious passages were of
the most brilliant order, but their effect was sadly marred by the
failing already alluded to. The allusion to the Sphynx is a
striking illustration of this:</p>

<p>"The great face was so sad, so earnest, so longing, so patient.
There was a dignity not of earth in its mien, and in its
countenance a benignity such as never any thing human wore. It was
stone, but it seemed sentient! If ever image of stone thought, it
was thinking. It was looking toward the verge of the landscape, but
looking at nothing--nothing but distance and vacancy. It was
looking over and beyond every thing of the present, and far into
the past. It was gazing out over the ocean of time--over lines of
century-waves which, further and further receding, closed nearer
and nearer together, and blended at last into one unbroken tide,
away toward the horizon of a remote antiquity.</p>

<p>It was thinking of the wars of departed ages--of the empires it
had seen created and destroyed--of the nations whose birth it had
witnessed, whose progress it had watched, whose annihilation it had
noted--of the joy and sorrow, the life and death, the grandeur and
decay, of five thousand slow revolving years.</p>

<p>"It was the type of an attribute of man--of a faculty of his
heart and brain. It was M<font size="- 1">EMORY</font>--R<font
size="-1">ETROSPECTIVE</font>--wrought into visible, tangible form.
All who know what pathos there is in memories of days that are
accomplished and faces that have vanished--albeit only a trifling
score of years gone by--will have some appreciation of the pathos
that dwells in these grave eyes that look so steadfastly back upon
the things they knew before history was born--before tradition had
being--things that were, and forms that moved, in a vague era which
even poetry and romance scarce know of--and passed one by one away
and left the stony dreamer solitary in the midst of a strange new
age, and uncomprehended scenes!</p>

<p>"The Sphynx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in its
magnitude; it is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its
story. And there is that in the overshadowing majesty of this
eternal figure of stone, with its accusing memory of the deeds of
all ages, which reveals to one something of what he shall feel when
he stands at last in the awful presence of God!"</p>
