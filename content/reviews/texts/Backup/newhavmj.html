<h2>New Haven <i>Morning Journal and Courier</i> [unsigned]<br>
1876: December 21</h2>

<p>We have already alluded to Mark Twain's new book, "The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer." The work has just been published, and is
a most capital subject for a holiday gift. Like all of its author's
works, it overflows with rare and quaint humor; and, in addition to
its attractive subject-matter, it has the advantage of being bound
very handsomely, printed on heavy tinted paper, and beautified with
150 illustrations, and is to be obtained at a far lower price than
Twain's other works. It contains about 300 pages. The lady agent
for this city may be found at 88 Court Street, where any subscriber
omitted by her may obtain the book.</p>
