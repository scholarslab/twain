<br>
 <b><font size="+1">Mark Twain at the Tacoma
Theatre.</font></b><br>
<br>
 Mark had a crowded house last night. Tacoma's very best people
were out in force to listen to him, and they were ready to laugh
upon the slightest provocation. That is, the most of them were.
There were some very intelligent people in the audience who were
unable to swing into line with Mark's peculiar kind of humor and
they looked tired, too tired even to smile. But he tickled the
risibilities of all the rest, and they enjoyed themselves
thoroughly and paid no attention to the folks who were too opaque
to appreciate the fun. His evening in Tacoma was a big success.
