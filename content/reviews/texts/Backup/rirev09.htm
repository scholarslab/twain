<p>Mark Twain's new volume, <i>Roughing It</i>, is also in part
  tropical in its subject.  Among its most entertaining chapters are those which describe the
  author's visit to the Hawaiian Islands--chapters which, first published as letters to a
  California newspaper, are here gathered up, with some excisions, in a permanent form.  In
  this work Mr. Clemens has produced one of his more readable volumes.  The fact that he
  had written much of it before reaching its present fame as a humorist is in its favor.
  Thackeray said of his earlier efforts: "It makes me laugh when I think of
  the old days, and how much better I wrote for them then, and got a shilling where I now
  get ten."  We only wish that Mr. Clemens had made fewer alterations than he has made in
  those rollicking, often ludicrous descriptions, the <i>Sacramento
  Union</i> letters here reprinted.  As it is, we can imagine the despair with which the
  less intuitive reader will struggle to separate the nonsense from the sense, the fact from
  the fiction, the portraiture from the exaggerations of these pages.  Mark Twain's humor is
  in this respect peculiarly and purposely tantalizing, though not, therefore, less enjoyable.
  The sketches of Western life are equally amusing.  We may remark, too, that his fun is
  not dependent upon bad spelling or bad grammar.  He writes good English, and we can
  commend the book to all who enjoy the wild Western drollery of which Mark Twain is
  the ablest living master.  As a remarkably full repository of Western slang this work has a
  literary interest which will give it a permanent value to the student of Americanisms.</p>
