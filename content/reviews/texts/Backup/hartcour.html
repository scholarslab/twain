<h2><i>Hartford Daily Courant</i> [Charles Dudley Warner]<br>
1876: December 27</h2>

<p>Mark Twain's <i>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> was published in
England last June, and immediately many of the most easily detached
and quotable portions of it found their way into the American
press, and a wide circulation. The COURANT printed at the time two
or three extracts from the book--Tom's adventure with the beetle in
church, a most delightful study as well as a piece of profound
philosophy, and the whitewashing of the fence, a bit of genuine fun
with an artistic finish that would give the author a deserved
reputation if he had never written anything else. The volume has
just been brought out here in a very handsome style, copiously
illustrated with drawings by Mr. J. W. Williams, who has happily
entered into the spirit of the book, and produced excellent and on
the whole the best set of character sketches we have ever seen from
his pencil. The engravings do not all do justice to the original
drawings, but they are more than fair, and as the text is
beautifully printed on broad pages, the whole effect is very
pleasing, and the volume is attractive at the first glance.</p>

<p><i>Tom Sawyer</i> is in some respects an advance on anything
that Mr. Clemens has before done--an advance we mean as a piece of
literary work, careful in finish, and thought out more maturely. It
has not the large, original force of the uncontrollable,
spontaneous humor that in "The Innocents Abroad" carried an
irrepressible burst of merriment round the globe, from San
Francisco to India by way of Europe, but it has passages as
exquisitely humorous as any in that book, and as a general thing it
is more finely wrought. The passages we have spoken of above amply
sustain this assertion; you can read them again and again with new
delight, and indeed, we find it difficult not to read them every
time we take up the book. They could not have been written without
the spark of genius. We find in this book, too, the author's style,
not more virile and sparklingly clear than formerly, but more
carefully finished; and the author has toned down a little those
excursions into the impossible, which are intensely amusing, but do
not commend themselves to the judgment on a second reading. And in
doing this he has lost nothing of his extraordinarily forceful use
of the English language. There is no one writing today who has a
finer intuitive sense of the right word in the right place.</p>

<p>The book is all about boys, and it is said to be written for
boys. It is a masterly reproduction of boy's life and feeling, but,
at the same time, it is written above boys: that is, the best part
of it--the wit, the humor, the genius of it will fly miles above
every boy's head in the country. The boys can appreciate the
adventure in it as a mere narrative, but not that which makes the
adventure valuable to older readers, who recall their own boyhood
in it. The boy has not the least sense of humor; that is nothing
funny to him in having his pocket in measure of useless trash; the
tricks he plays upon his comrades are not amusing to him; he is a
non-humorous, dead, in earnest creature, and it is this
characteristic that makes him amusing to us (to himself in
retrospect); but his serious life does not take in what we call
humor. It is for this reason that we say that Tom Sawyer will be
enjoyed most by mature readers, who will have a great delight in
seeing how faithfully boy life is recalled.</p>

<p>Boy nature is the same everywhere, and the characteristics here
given are of universal acceptance; but local coloring (as it is now
called) is different, and the boys of this book are of Missouri and
not of New England in a good many of their ways; and so they ought
to be, being studies from life. We should not counsel New England
boys to expect or to imitate some of the adventures in this book,
but they doubtless are true enough to the society they sketch. The
Missouri boy who has mighty stirrings in his soul and feels deeply
the desperate injustice of his tender home, may want to go away and
be a noble river pirate, just as the New England boy is sometimes
moved to run away to sea. But neither of them we fancy ever finds
or makes a pot of money by any sudden streak of luck.</p>

<p>We do not believe that Tom Sawyer or his comrades have the least
idea how bright a boy he is, or what exceedingly funny things he
says; he is as bright as Mark Twain himself. And probably no boy
will appreciate the deep fun and satire of the following passage.
In a midnight adventure of Tom and his companion, Huckleberry, the
boys think they are lost and fall into a panic. Huckleberry <a

<p>The Sunday-school chapter, in which Tom's financial abilities
come out strong, and he trades himself into the possession of the
first prize, and in which he exhibits his Biblical knowledge, is
saturated with the keenest humor; but a boy will hardly comprehend
the fine observation and deep satirical humor of the scene. It is
prize day and company is present. On the platform is the great
Judge Thatcher, the county judge, and it is an important hour for
Mr. Walters, the superintendent, and for the whole school. It was
an impressive silence when Jeff Thatcher, the brother of the judge,
observed by "ranks of staring eyes," went forward to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the <a name="8">
school:--</a><br>

<br>
<p>Tom is a genuine boy and his Aunt Polly is a genuine woman; both
are capitally drawn; and the author has given to both some noble
traits and elements of pathos which make them remain our friends
long after the laughter they excite has ceased. The book is full of
quotable things, scenes as amusing as anything Mr. Clemens has
written, with now and then a stroke of good humored satire that is
as well deserved as it is artistically administered--take the
school examination and exhibition as a specimen; the remarks on the
"compositions" of the young ladies might well be framed and hung up
in every school room. But it is unnecessary to quote from a book
which everybody will read.</p>
