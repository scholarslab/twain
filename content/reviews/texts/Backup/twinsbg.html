<br>
<b><font size="+1">Mark Twain and Mr. Cable.</font></b><br>
<br>
 George W. Cable, the novelist, and Samuel L. Clemens, known to the
world as Mark Twain, entertained a very large audience, last
evening, at Music Hall, in the fifth of the Bay State course. Mr.
Cable gave selections from his own writings. He was in admirable
voice and some of the touches reminded one of some of the best
passages of Dickens. To see Mark Twain is to laugh and to hear him
is to laugh still more. His drollery is perennial, always fresh and
always entertaining. His struggle with the German language and his
trying conversation with the young American lady in the hotel
dining-room at Lucerne were especially funny, while the ghost story
had a startling conclusion.

<p>Rev. Henry Ward Beecher appears in the next entertainment of the
course, next Thursday evening.</p>
