 <b><font size="+1">The Mark Twain-Cable Readings.</font></b><br>
<br>
Major J.B. Pond has brought before the public for three readings in
this city the names Mark Twain and George W. Cable, and they have
proved a powerful attraction among the most cultivated and
intelligent people of this city. The first reading was given last
night at Association Hall, where a very select audience assembled,
filling three circles of the pretty auditorium.

<p>It is "too late a week" to criticize work so artistic and so
well known. Suffice it to say that Mr. Cable gave "Narcisse and
John and Mary Richling," from "Dr. Sevier," the courting scene in
the same book in which Kate Riley so amusingly chaffs Ristofalo,
"Narcisse in Mourning for Lady Byron," and the great humorist
recited, while tears ran down his listeners' cheeks, some scenes
from the advance sheets of the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and
the "Tragic Tale of the Fishwife," described "A Trying Situation,"
one of his funniest efforts, in which a gentleman who does not
recognize a lady, who does recognize him, is utterly mystified and
overwhelmingly embarrassed by her questioning him about a
fictitious past, in what she calls "a delightful talk about old
times," and wound up with a ghost story which convulsed his
audience. The next entertainments will take place at Association
Hall on the afternoon and evening of Wednesday, November 26, when,
as Mr. Clemens expresses it, he will "continue to make his last,
final farewell appearance."</p>
