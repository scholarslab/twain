<center><b>Mark Twain's Lecture.</b></center><br>
<p>Mr. Clemens, author of "The Innocents Abroad," gave an oral entertainment before the Lyceum, at the Town Hall, last Monday evening, on Artemus Ward.  The speaker broke loose from red tape by introducing himself, and taking off, in an amusing manner, the encomiastic style of Lyceum presidents when discharging that formal duty of prefatory etiquette.  The so-called lecture consisted of a collection of anecdotal beads, threaded with a constrained filament of tattered biography.  How many of the laughable humorisms attributed to Artemus Ward were A. W's., and how many Mark Twain's, is a conundrum not easily guessed.  Mr. Clemens's homely face, and drawling, tipsy style of speech, are somewhat against him, though we suppose they are natural.  On the whole the patch-work entertainment was pleasing, and in our estimation, well worth $15,or even $20.</p>

<center><font size=+1><b>Mark Twain's Lecture.</b></font></center><br>
<p>One of the largest and most critical audiences ever assembled in Malden, gathered in the Town Hall on Monday evening to listen to one of America's greatest humorists.  The names of Nasby, Twain, Billings and Artemus Ward, suggest wit, humor and fun, and the anxiety to see and hear those whose profession, or rather whose mental characteristics are all turned to the absurd and comical side of things, is greater than to look upon celebrities of a severer cast.  Mark Twain's book, "Innocents Abroad, or the new Pilgrim's Progress" has given him a world-wide reputation, and is pronounced the greatest work of its kind ever published in America.  It has already realized a sale of upwards of 110,000 copies; an immense demand, and an evidence of its wonderful merits and attraction.  Of course the author of such a work has long since become a "literary lion," and as such, a sight of him is considered an event.  In order to "show him up" the lyceum platform becomes a cage whereon he can be exhibited.  The lecture is the opportunity, and no matter whether he has a gift for oratory or not, no matter if he, (this "he" is the generic term for the whole class of peripatetic celebrities) is utterly devoid of all those graces and attractions which constitute an acceptable speaker, the people must see him.  The more outre the better, as the lack of grace and finish is regarded as a proof of genius, and awkward gesticulation as the more natural method of impressing an audience.  Taking this as the stand-point from which to view that class of lecturers of which "Mark Twain" is a specimen, we can readily understand the source of his attraction.  His first lecture in Boston some two or three years ago, entitled "Our Fellow Savages in the Sandwich Islands," was immensely successful, principally on account of its oddity, crudeness, fun and complete contrast to those productions which usually find expression upon the platform.  If Mark Twain had not secured a deserved reputation as one of the greatest humorists of the present century, by his book, his lectures would be considered as unfit to present to the enlightened and fastidious audiences of New England.</p>
<p>His lecture on Monday evening was a medley of fact and fiction, garnished with stories and droll experiences of "Artemus Ward," whose real name was Charles F. Brown.  Although the lecture was evidently intended as a biographial sketch of this remarkable man, it was so patched up that it was difficult to tell which was Ward and which was Twain.  It served to keep the large audience in good humor, and whatever verdict each listener gave as to the merits or de-merits of the lecture, they were all gratified to see "Mark Twain."</p>
<p>As a lecturer, he is awkward, uncouth, and his manner of speaking is such as to impress those who hear him for the first time that he is slightly inebriated.  This however is one of the idiosyncracies of genius, and is as natural to him, as Josh Billing's style of walk and manner is peculiar to himself.  Of the American Humorists -- Twain, Nasby and Billings, -- we regard the first as the least entertaining as a lecturer. Nevertheless, everybody was delighted to see and hear "Mark Twain."</p>
