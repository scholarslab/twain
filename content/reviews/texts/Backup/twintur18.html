"MARK TWAIN" AND MR. CABLE.</b><br>
 Mr. Samuel L. Clemens and Mr. George W. Cable appeared at
Blackstone Hall on Saturday before two audiences as interpreters of
their own writings. Both these gentlemen have read in this city
before, and their appearance and style of delivery are known. In
the afternoon the audience filled about two-thirds of the sittings.
Mr. Cable's selections were from "Dr. Sevier," and included scenes
between Narcisse and Kate Riley, Narcisse and John Richling, when
the Creole was mourning the death of Lady Byron and endeavoring to
decide whether his obituary tribute should be poetic or prosaic in
form, and the courtship of Kate Riley by the Italian Ristofalo. Mr.
Cable was singularly successful, not only in tone and accent but in
pose and gesture in depicting the widely different characters, the
volatile Celtic widow, the sentimental Creole and the honest love
of the pleading Italian of few plain words. Mary Richling's ride
with the spy through both federal and confederate lines was Mr.
Cable's closing reading. The selection is a strong one and it was
read and acted with a force and realism seldom seen even on the
dramatic stage with the accessories of scenery. It must certainly
be regarded as a mark of talent little short of genius that a man
of Mr. Cable's pursuits can so completely obliterate himself by
conveying in rapid turns the whispers or hoarse commands of the
spy, the husky croak of the negro guide, the terrified cry of the
infant awakened by the shots of the sentries, and the agonizing
wail of the mother riding for life and her husband's bedside, as to
cause no rude shock in the listener. This selection may be deemed
the author's supreme effort on the platform. It was thrillingly
rendered. At its close he sang a Creole love song to <i>ma belle
p'tit' fille</i>, without accompaniment. The contrast with the
pathos of the preceding selection was too great, and the song fell
flat. The author noted this, and the second verse was much better
appreciated.

<p>Mr. Clemens ran his hand through his hair, and with a few
humorous remarks about the programme, calling for something he
hadn't at hand, proceeded to ignore it. He read the story of a
reporter's attempt to interview him, in which he solemnly stated
that either he or his twin brother was drowned in the bathtub in
infancy, which was never known, and also the account of his
experience as temporary editor of an agricultural weekly. An old
sea captain's story was well told, and in conclusion Mr. Clemens
narrated a ghost story about the woman with the golden arm, a story
similar to one of Uncle Remus's. It was like crooning a nursery
tale to adults; but it was well told, and was so well received as
to suggest that the Remus stories read by their author would find
appreciative listeners.</p>

<p>The hall was nearly filled by a select and cultured audience at
the evening entertainment. Mr. Cable appeared first, and rendered
several peculiar airs, illustrative of the "Songs of the Place
Congo." Mr. Clemens again took the liberty to change the selections
which had been announced for him, for the double reason, as he
stated in his characteristic manner, that he could not endure it to
be always bound down to a fixed course of action, and he also knew
that the audience would not endure to hear him read all that the
programme had set out for him. It would take until after breakfast
time next morning, and he was very particular about his breakfast.
And so the humorist repeated "The Tragic Tale of the Fishwife," a
suite upon the confounding of gender in German nouns. Mr. Clemens
was very cordially applauded, both on his first appearance and at
the end of each of his readings.</p>

<p>Mr. Cable gave selections from the familiar story of "Powson
Jone'." As usual he did not appear at his best at the outset of his
recitation, but gradually lost himself in the impersonations, and
then displayed that brilliant versatility in the dramatic
representation of entirely different characters, which is the
remarkable feature of his readings and which makes so realistic the
pictures he presents. The interview between that innocently artful
sophist, Jules St. Ange, and the repenting parson so overcome by
reflection on "My sins, Jools, my sins," in the calaboose, whither
the young Frenchman goes to liberate the West Floridian, was given
with consummate skill, and called forth hearty applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens delighted the audience with some of the enthusiastic
and visionary projects of the famous "Col. Mulberry Sellers," for
the materialization of the waste human forces floating about in the
atmosphere, and only awaiting such a scientific genius as that of
Sellers to make them of incalculable benefit to the world at large,
while accumulating untold millions for the inventor. The humorist
introduced one variation for the occasion, which was greatly
appreciated and warmly applauded, being the proposition of Col.
Sellers to materialize voters and enter upon political life,
because the dead voters capable of materialization would so
outnumber the live ones that there would be no uncertainty as to
the result, and no waiting four or five days before we could find
out who was elected.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens gave as his third selection "The Trying Situation,"
which was on the afternoon programme but was not read then, and
closed with the repetition of the story of the Golden Arm, of which
the startling denouement made a good share of the audience jump
perceptibly from their seats.</p>

<p>It is to be said that the "Twain"-Cable combination affords a
very agreeable and instructive entertainment. The distinguished
Louisiana novelist has fully sustained the favorable impression
which he made upon his Providence audiences, on the occasion of his
first visit here, last Spring, and the opportunity of hearing Mr.
Clemens, as the interpreter of his own humor, was highly
appreciated by the hosts of readers of his "health-promoting"
sketches. It was a matter of regret to the auditors that the
enunciation of Mr. Clemens was not at all times as distinct as it
might have been, but his manner and intonation in portraying the
situations of his various characters added to the pictures an
appreciation which printed pages along cannot afford.</p>
