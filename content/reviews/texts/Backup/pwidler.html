<h2><i>Idler</i> [unsigned]<br>
1894: August</h2>

<p>[<i>This review seems to be based on the story's serial
publication in</i> The Century<i>, where it had just finished
appearing in June. The novel was not published until
November.</i>]</p>

<br>
 

<p><i>Puddenhead Wilson</i>, Mark Twain's latest story, is the work
of a novelist, rather than of a "funny man." There is plenty of
humour in it of the genuine Mark Twain brand, but it is as a
carefully painted picture of life in a Mississippi town in the days
of slavery that its chief merit lies. In point of construction it
is much the best story that Mark Twain has written, and of men and
women in the book at least four are undeniably creations, and not
one of them is overdrawn or caricatured, as are some of the most
popular of the author's lay figures. There is but one false note in
the picture, and that is the introduction of the two alleged
Italian noblemen. These two young men are as little like Italians
as they are like Apaches. When challenged to fight a duel, one of
them, having the choice of weapons, chooses revolvers instead of
swords. This incident alone is sufficient to show how little
Italian blood there is in Mark Twain's Italians. But this is a
small blemish, and if Mark Twain, in his future novels, can
maintain the proportion of only two lay figures to four living
characters, he will do better than most novelists. The extracts
from "Puddenhead Wilson's Almanac," which are prefixed to each
chapter of the book, simply "pizon us for more," to use Huck Finn's
forcible metaphor. Let us hope that a complete edition of that
unrivalled almanac will be issued at no distant day.</p>
