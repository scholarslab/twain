 <b><font size="+1">Genius and Versatility. Mr. Cable Exhibits Both
and Mark Twain Something Else.</font></b> <br>


<p>A numerous and enthusiastic audience assembled in Chickering
Hall last evening to listen to readings from the writings of Mr.
Samuel L. Clemens--who prefers to be known as "Mark Twain"--and Mr.
George W. Cable. The gentlemen who read were the gentlemen who had
written. The management, in its newspaper advertisements, spoke of
the entertainment as a "combination of genius and versatility," but
neglected to say which of the gentlemen had the genius and which
the versatility. Some of those who were present last evening may
have felt justified in coming to the conclusion that Mr. Cable
represented both these elements, while Mr. Clemens was simply man,
after the fashion of that famous hunting animal one-half of which
was pure Irish setter and the other half "just plain dog." Mr.
Cable was humorous, pathetic, weird, grotesque, tender, and
melodramatic by turns, while Mr. Clemens confined his efforts to
the ridicule of such ridiculous matters as aged colored gentlemen,
the German language, and himself.</p>

<p>It became evident early in the evening that the gentlemen who
conceived the plan of bringing these two readers together had a
marvelous faculty for grasping the sublimest possibilities of
contrast. The audience appeared, however, to enjoy the sensation of
dropping abruptly downward from such delightful people as Narcisse,
Ristofalo, and Kate Riley to such earthy creatures as Huckleberry
Finn.</p>

<p>The first section was from "Dr. Sevier," the interesting scene
in which Narcisse thinks she can "baw that fifty dollar" himself.
Then Mr. Clemens recited a selection from "The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn," which will be continued in Mr. Clemens's next
book. Mr. Cable followed with the scene from "Dr. Sevier," in which
Kate Riley yields her hand so eagerly to Ristofalo. The audience
appeared to enjoy hugely the Italian's complacent "Da's all right."
Mr. Clemens then read his "Tragic Tale of a Fishwife," which
contained some remarkable linguistic contortions produced by
adapting the German genders to the English language. Mr. Clemens
was recalled after this effort and ladled out another section of
the "Huckleberry Finn" advance sheets.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Cable read "A Sound of Drums," from "Dr. Sevier." This
masterly bit of word-painting was recited with fine elocutionary
art, and held the audience spellbound to the close, when a burst of
enthusiastic applause recalled Mr. Cable to the stage and compelled
him to sing one of the old Confederate war songs that he learned by
the camp fire. Mr. Clemens recited "A Trying Situation," one of
those peculiar productions which attributes to its author much
idiocy, and suggests the thought that it was written in the hope
that it would make men deem the writer a very different kind of
man. Mr. Cable's last selection from "Dr. Sevier" was "Mary's Night
Ride," in which weirdness, tenderness, and melodramatic force were
joined with a rare skill that evoked hearty and continued
applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens concluded the entertainment with "A Ghost Story,"
which had no merit beyond the reader's suggestion that it was a
queer story to tell children at bedtime. This afternoon the same
programme will be given, and this evening this combination of
contrasts will present a fresh batch of readings.</p>

 <b><font size="+1">READINGS BY CLEMENS AND CABLE.</font></b> <br>


<p>Chickering Hall was well filled yesterday afternoon, in spite of
the rain, for the readings of Mark Twain and George W. Cable. The
audience consisted principally of ladies and, if not enthusiastic,
showed a full appreciation of the performance. Mr. Cable presented
four selections from "Dr. Sevier." His comic selections roused
little more than languid laughter. "Mary's Night Ride," however,
the last piece which he gave, was of a serious character, and met
with considerable applause. Mr. Clemens gave only humorous pieces.
"A Trying Situation" seemed to be specially acceptable to the
audience.</p>

<p>Despite the rainy weather, a great many people heard the
readings in the evening. Mr. Clemens' stories were punctuated with
laughter at every few words. Mr. Cable generally received his
applause all in a lump at the end.</p>
