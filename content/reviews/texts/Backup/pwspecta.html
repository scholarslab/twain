<h2><i>Spectator</i> [unsigned]<br>
1895: March 16</h2>

<p>--Has Mr. Samuel L. Clemens found Missouri audiences or readers
slow to appreciate his jokes? Mr. David Wilson comes to a Missouri
town to push his fortunes. Unluckily his first utterance when he
lands from a steamer -- did steamboats pass "every hour or so" up
and down the Mississippi in 1830? -- is about a yelping dog, that
if he owned half of the beast he would kill his half. This would
have been a fair joke in New York; to the Missourians it seemed
proof positive that the speaker was a fool. Hence the sobriquet of
"Pudd'nhead" which the public opinion of the town fastens upon him.
But he doesn't deserve it. On the contrary, he is a clever fellow.
He understands, for instance, how the impressions of finger-tips
may be made proofs of identity -- is not this again a little before
date in 1830? This is the point of the story, which is a somewhat
gloomy but powerful tale of the slavery times. "Mark Twain's"
negroes are not of the Uncle Tom type; but the story is not on that
account a less vigorous indictment of the old social order of the
South.</p>
