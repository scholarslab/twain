L<font size="-1">ECTURE ON THE</font> S<font size=
"-1">ANDWICH</font> I<font size="-1">SLANDS</font>. -- In
accordance with his humorous advertisement, Mark Twain delivered
his wonderful lecture, on the Sandwich Islands, at the Mercantile
Library Hall last night. The audience was large and appreciative,
and financially and every other way the entertainment proved a
complete success. In fact, Mark Twain achieved a very decided
success. He succeeded in doing what we have seen Emerson and other
literary magnates fail in attempting. He interested and amused a
large and promiscuous audience.</p>

<p>Mark has the gift of a bright and happy fancy, and expresses his
thoughts with no ordinary force and gracefulness of language. His
descriptive powers are good, and his descriptive powers very fair
for a young lecturer.</p>

<p>We shall attempt no synopsis of his entertainment. Ostensibly it
was on the Sandwich Islands, but while it contained not a little
valuable information and many passages of felicitious description,
it also embraced many other topics geographically and otherwise
foreign to the matter in hand, and had many a piquant piece of
humor interwoven, which, with the bright flash of genuine wit,
startled with laughter and kept alive the attention of the
audience. As to the wonderful [feats?] promised in the
advertisement they were forgotten in the intellectual amusement
afforded; and in the minor matter of swallowing a child Mark failed
to come to time, possibly because no lady volunteered an infant for
the occasion. We did not learn who was lucky enough to win
Lafayette Park.</p>

<p>Our readers are aware this lecture was delivered for the benefit
of the South St. Louis Mission Sunday School -- a most worthy
object and certainly calling for the patronage of the Christian
community.</p>

<p>This evening the lecture will be repeated at the same place and
for the same object. Let all go who wish to be instructed and
amused, and at the same time assist a deserving cause. "The wisdom
will begin to flow at eight o'clock, and not a drop should be
lost."</p>
