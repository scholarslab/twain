<h3>"Huckleberry Finn" and His Critics.</h3>
</center>

<p>A very deplorable fact is that the great body of literary
criticism is mainly perfunctory. This is not due to a lack of
ability or to a lack of knowledge. It is due to the fact that most
of it is from the pens of newspaper writers who have no time to
elaborate their ideas. They are in a hurry, and what they write is
hurried. Under these circumstances it is not unnatural that they
should take their cues from inadequate sources and give to the
public opinions that are either conventional or that have no
reasonable basis.</p>

<p>All this is the outcome of the conditions and circumstances of
American life. There is no demand for sound criticism any more than
there is a demand for great poetry. We have a leisure class, but
its tastes run towards horses, yachting and athletic sports, in
imitation of the English young men who occasionally honor these
shores with their presence. The imitation, after all, is a limping
one. The young Englishman of leisure is not only fond of outdoor
sports, but of books. He has culture and taste, and patronizes
literature with as much enthusiasm as he does physical amusements.
If our leisure class is to imitate the English, it would be better
if the imitation extended somewhat in the direction of culture.</p>

<p>The American leisure class--the class that might be expected to
patronize good literature and to create a demand for sound,
conservative criticism--is not only fond of horses, but is
decidedly horsey. It is coarse and uncultivated. It has no taste in
either literature or art. It reads few books and buys its pictures
in Europe by the yard.</p>

<p>We are led to these remarks by the wholly inadequate verdict
that has recently been given in some of the most prominent
newspapers as to the merits of Mark Twain's new book, "The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." The critics seem to have gotten
their cue in this instance from the action of the Concord library,
the directors of which refused the book a place on their shelves.
This action, as was afterwards explained, was based on the fact
that the book was a work of fiction, and not because of the
humorous characteristics that are popularly supposed to attach to
the writings of Mr. Clemens. But the critics had got their cue
before the explanation was made, and they straightway proceeded to
inform the reading public that the book was gratuitously coarse,
its humor unneccessarily broad, and its purpose crude and
inartistic.</p>

<p>Now, nothing could be more misleading than such a criticism as
this. It is difficult to believe that the critics who have
condemned the book as coarse, vulgar and inartistic can have read
it. Taken in connection with "The Prince and the Pauper," it marks
a clear and distinct advance in Mr. Clemens's literary methods. It
presents an almost artistically perfect picture of the life and
character in the southwest, and it will be equally valuable to the
historian and to the student of sociology. Its humor, which is
genuine and never-failing, is relieved by little pathetic touches
here and there that vouch for its literary value.</p>

<p>It is the story of a half illiterate, high-spirited boy whose
adventures are related by himself. The art with which this
conception is dealt with is perfect in all its details. The boy's
point of view is never for a moment lost sight of, and the moral of
the whole is that this half illiterate boy can be made to present,
with perfect consistency, not only the characters of the people
whom he meets, but an accurate picture of their social life. From
the artistic point of view, there is not a coarse nor vulgar
suggestion from the beginning to the end of the book. Whatever is
coarse and crude is in the life that is pictured, and the picture
is perfect. It may be said that the humor is sometimes excessive,
but it is genuine humor--and the moral of the book, though it is
not scrawled across every page, teaches the necessity of manliness
and self-sacrifice.</p>
