<h2><i>Truth</i>[Desmond O'Brien]<br>
 1890: January 2</h2>

<br>


<p>My dear Mr. Wyndham, -- It has occurred to a good many prophets
since Lord Lytton wrote <i>The Coming Race</i>, --</p>

<p><font size="-1">To dip into the future, far as human eye could
see,<br>
Show the vision of the world, and all the wonders that would
be.</font></p>

<p>but it was reserved, I think, for Mark Twain to put on Hans
Andersen's Goloshes of Happiness and go back to the past, carrying
with him all the wonders of the present. <i>A Yankee at the Court
of King Arthur</i> is a bizarre book, full of all kinds of
laughable and delightful incongruities -- the most striking of its
incongruities, however, being unconscious, grim, and disenchanting.
For Mark Twain, as he goes on, gets into a fury so ferocious (and
natural) with the infernal oppression of the people by the Nobles,
the King, and the Church that he passes in a sentence from laughing
into raving at the "good old times"; and, like Macbeth at sight of
Banquo's ghost, he "displaces the mirth" of the feast he had
prepared for us. His fooling is admirable and his preaching is
admirable, but they are mutually destructive. In every page he
preaches pretty much what Richard Rumbold preached two centuries
since -- "I never could believe that Providence had sent a few men
into the world ready booted and spurred to ride, and millions ready
saddled and bridled to be ridden" -- but Rumbold preached it from
the most commanding of pulpits -- the scaffold -- whereas Mark
Twain preaches it from the sawdust of the circus and in the
intervals between a couple of jests or a couple of summersaults.
But it is thoroughly sound doctrine, and is needed still so sorely
in England and Ireland that it is ungracious to grumble at the mode
of its delivery. It will reach a larger audience, and, perhaps,
strike many of them more by its grotesque presentation than if the
preacher wore a less bizarre garb than motley.</p>

<p><font size="-1">Ridentem dicere verum<br>
 Quid vetat?</font></p>

<p>Still, such frightful episodes as that of the woman who was
burned to make a fire to warm a slave gang, or that of the hanging
of the young mother -- wife of the "pressed" man-o'-war's man --
with her baby at her breast (an incident, by the way, Mr. Mark
Twain, not of the sixth century, but of the beginning of the
nineteenth), freeze the laughter on our lips.</p>
