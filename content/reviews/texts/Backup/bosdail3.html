<p>Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" had a certain
relishable flavor when mixed up with the miscellaneous assortment
of magazine literature; but in a book form, and covering more than
350 pages, they are wearisome and labored. It would be abou t as
easy to read through a jest book, as to keep up one's interest in
the monotonous humor and the dialectic variations of "Huck Finn's"
narrative. Here and there are spatches of Mark Twain's best work,
which could be read over and over again, and yet b ring each time
an outburst of laugher; but one cannot have the book long in his
hands without being tempted to regret that the author should so
often have laid himself open to the charge of coarseness and bad
taste. The illustrations are admirable in thei r way. As to the
general character of the book, it may be sufficient to remind the
reader of the author's notice, that "all persons attempting to find
a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting
to find a moral in it will be banished ; persons attempting to find
a plot in it will be shot."</p>
