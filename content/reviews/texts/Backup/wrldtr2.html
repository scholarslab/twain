 <b><font size="+1">MARK TWAIN<br>
Delighted a Large Audience Last Night at the Opera
House.</font></b><br>
<br>
 The inimitable Mark Twain, who has chased away somber thoughts and
straightened out the creases in millions of brows by his quaint
humor, visited Great Falls for the first time yesterday. He was
accompanied by his wife and daughter and Maj. Pond, who is so well
known as the veteran lecture bureau man. Mrs. Pond also accompanies
the party, who are bent on making a trip around the world.

<p>The lecture last night was attended by the best people in the
city and thoroughly enjoyed by them. It was largely made up from
selections from his works. The quaintness and originality of the
man and his manner gave an added charm to the stories. The finale
of the lecture was a ghost story, which ended with a surprise to
the audience, and illustrated as well perhaps as anything the
peculiar humor of the man.</p>

<p>After the lecture Mr. Clemens (Mark Twain) and Maj. Pond were
the guests of the Electric club, and it is unnecessary to say that
they had a jolly good time.</p>
