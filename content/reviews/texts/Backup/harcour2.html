 1885: February 20</h2>

<br>


<p>In his latest story, <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> (Tom Sawyer's
Comrade), by Mark Twain, Mr. Clemens has made a very distinct
literary advance over Tom Sawyer, as an interpreter of human nature
and a contributor to our stock of original pictures of Americ an
life. Still adhering to his plan of narrating the adventures of
boys, with a primeval and Robin Hood freshness, he has broadened
his canvas and given us a picture of a people, of a geographical
region, of a life that is new in the world. The scene of h is
romance is the Mississippi river. Mr. Clemens has written of this
river before specifically, but he has not before presented it to
the imagination so distinctly nor so powerfully. Huck Finn's voyage
down the Mississippi with the run away nigger Jim, an d with
occasionally other companions, is an adventure fascinating in
itself as any of the classic outlaw stories, but in order that the
reader may know what the author has done for him, let him notice
the impression left on his mind of this lawless, myste rious,
wonderful Mississippi, when he has closed the book. But it is not
alone the river that is indelibly impressed upon the mind, the life
that went up and down it and went on along its banks are projected
with extraordinary power. Incidentally, and wit h a true artistic
instinct, the villages, the cabins, the people of this river become
startlingly real. The beauty of this is that it is apparently done
without effort. Huck floating down the river happens to see these
things and to encounter the people a nd the characters that made
the river famous forty years ago--that is all. They do not have the
air of being invented, but of being found. And the dialects of the
people, white and black--what a study are they; and yet nobody
talks for the sake of exhibit ing a dialect. It is not necessary to
believe the surprising adventures that Huck engages in, but no one
will have a moment's doubt of the reality of the country and the
people he meets.</p>

Another thing to be marked in the story is its dramatic power. Take
the story of the Southern Vendetta--a marvelous piece of work in a
purely literary point of view--and the episode of the duke and the
king, with its pictures of Mississippi communi ties, both of which
our readers probably saw in the <i>Century</i> magazine. They are
equaled in dramatic force by nothing recently in literature. We are
not in this notice telling the story or quoting from a book that
nearly everybody is sure to read, but it is proper to say that Mr.
Clemens strikes in a very amusing way certain psychological
problems. What, for instance, in the case of Huck , the son of the
town drunkard, perverted from the time of his birth, is conscience,
and how does it work? Most amusing is the struggle Huck has with
his conscience in regard to slavery. His conscience tells him, the
way it has been instructed, that to he lp the runaway, nigger Jim
to escape--to aid in stealing the property of Miss Watson, who has
never injured him, is an enormous offense that will no doubt carry
him to the bad place; but his affection for Jim finally induces him
to violate his conscience and risk eternal punishment in helping
Jim to escape. The whole study of Huck's moral nature is as serious
as it is amusing, his confusion of wrong as right and his abnormal
mendacity, traceable to his training from infancy, is a singular
contribution to the investigation of human nature. These
contradictions, however, do not interfere with the fun of the
story, which has all the comicality, all the odd way of looking at
life, all the whimsical turns of thought and expression that have
given the author his wide fame and made him <i>sui generis.</i> The
story is so interesting so full of life and dramatic force, that
the reader will be carried along irresistibly, and the time he
loses in laughing he will make up in diligence to hurry along and
find out how things come out. The book is a small quarto,
handsomely printed and bound, and illustrated by 174 drawings which
enter fully into the spirit of the book, and really help to set
forth the characters. (Published by Charles L. Webster &amp; Co.:
