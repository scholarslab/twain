<h2><i>Critic</i> [unsigned]<br>
1895: May 11</h2>

<p>The literary critic is often puzzled how to classify the
intellectual phenomena that come within his ken. His business is of
course primarily with <i>literature</i>. A work may be infinitely
amusing, it may abound even with flashes and touches of genius, and
yet the form in which it comes into the world may be so crude, so
coarse, so erring from the ways of true classicism, so offensive to
immemorial canons of taste, that the critic, in spite of his
enjoyment and wonder, puts it reluctantly down in the category of
unclassifiable literary things only to take it up and enjoy it
again!</p>

<p>Of such is <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, and, for that matter, Mark
Twain in general. The author is a signal example of sheer genius,
without training or culture in the university sense, setting forth
to conquer the world with laughter whether it will or no, and to
get himself thereby acknowledged to be the typical writer of the
West. He is the most successful of a class of American humorists
whose impulse to write off their rush of animal spirits is
irresistible, and who snatch at the first pen within reach as the
conductor of their animal electricity. If we look at other national
humorists, like Aristophanes, Cervantes, Moliere or Swift, we find
their humor expressed in an exquisite literary form, in which a
certain polish tempers the extravagance, and annoying metrical (or
it may be imaginative) difficulties have been overcome. What
wonderful bird-rhythms and wasp melodies and cloud-architecture, so
to speak, emerge from the marvellous choral interludes of the Greek
comedian; what suave literary graces enclose the gaunt outlines of
Don Quixote; in what honeyed verse are Alceste and Tartuffe
entangled, and what new, nervous, powerful prose describes the
adventures of Gulliver! When we turn our eyes westward we encounter
Judge Haliburton, Hosea Biglow, Uncle Remus, Mark Twain -- an
absolutely new <i>genre</i> distinct from what we had previously
studied in the line of originalities. The one accomplished artist
among these is Lowell, whose university traditions were very strong
and controlled his bubbling humor. The others are pure
"naturalists" -- men of instinctive genius, who have relied on
their own conscious strength to produce delight in the reader,
irrespective of classicity of form, literary grace or any other of
the beloved conventions on which literature as literature has
hitherto depended. This is true in a less degree of Uncle Rcmus
than of Judge Haliburton and Mark Twain.</p>

<p><i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> is no exception to the rule. It is a
Missouri tale of changelings "befo' the wah," admirable in
atmosphere, local color and dialect, a drama in its way, full of
powerful situations, thrilling even; but it cannot be called in any
sense literature. In it Mark Twain's brightness and grotesqueness
and funniness revel and sparkle, and in the absurd extravaganza,
"Those Extraordinary Twins," all these comicalities reach the
buffoon point; one is amused and laughs unrestrainedly but then the
irksome question comes up: What <i>is</i> this? is it literature?
is Mr. Clemens a "writer" at all? must he not after all be
described as an admirable after-dinner storyteller -- humorous,
imaginative, dramatic, like Dickens -- who in an evil moment, urged
by admiring friends, has put pen to paper and written down his
stories? Adapted to the stage and played by Frank Mayo, the thing
has met with immediate success.</p>
