<p>The San Francisco agents of this book give notice that, though
some unavoidable delays have occurred, this volume is now ready for
delivery to subscribers. As to the work itself, it is well
described by the author, as being without a motive, a moral, or a
plot. The only reason to be, as the French say, is probably that
the author thought he could make some money by publishing a book of
some kind, and here it is--such as it is. It is apparently, as the
art critics say, a pot-boiler in its baldest form. As a picture of
life in the Southwest, however, there is little to be said in the
book's favor, though there are several passages which are drawn
with much ability, with occasionally a touch of a sort of grotesque
pathos which greatly interests the reader. As to the rest, it is
very much of the same character as many of the author's Pacific
Coast sketches, in the utter absence of truth and being unlike
anything that ever existed in the earth, above the earth, or in the
waters under the earth. Some twenty-two years since, when Mr.
Clemens was working as a reporter on the <i>Territorial
Enterprise,</i> published in Virginia City, Nevada, he signalized
his career by getting up a series of startling stories, the most
prominent feature of which was the lack of a grain of fact. One of
Clemens' most notorious lucutrations in this line was the report of
the massacre of a whole family at Van Sickles or Empire City, which
caused much horror and also great annoyance. Mark Twain contended
that this was a good joke, and the parties who were inconvenienced
should not have got angry. When, however, it was his ox that was
gored, there were no such feelings of equanimity exhibited on his
side of the house. For instance, afterward, when he paid a visit to
his old haunts on the Comstock, a party of his former intimates
played a practical joke on him, he was one of the maddest mortals
who could be seen in a day's march. Something, however, should be
said in praise of the style in which the book has been published.
It is plentifully illustrated with engravings of no mean skill, and
is well printed in fine, clear type.</p>
