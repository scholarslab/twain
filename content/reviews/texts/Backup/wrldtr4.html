 <b><font size="+1">Mark Twain at the Marquam.</font></b><br>
<br>
Last night a brilliant audience was assembled at the Marquam Grand
to hear Samuel L. Clemens, otherwise known as Mark Twain, one of
the most noted humorists of the day. Those who had been anxiously
awaiting this event were in no way disappointed. In addition to the
keen, subtle wit which permeates his writings, his delivery is a
most fitting accompaniment. His droll, quiet manner, his peculiar
pronunciation, his inimitable drawl, all tend to give the audience
the time to see the point which everything he says unquestionably
has. His personal appearance, as also his facial expression are of
material value to him, and taken altogether, he carried the house
by storm, to judge from the applause which greeted every sally.

<p>With more solidity and depth than most of that class of writers,
Mark Twain keeps coming to the front instead of sinking into
oblivion, and the name is as familiar to the rising generation as
it was when he first made his appearance in the literary world. To
have accomplished this, there must have been more to his work than
simply humor. This humor must have been true to life rather than an
exaggeration to provoke mirth. In many cases, it is a question
whether his mirth is not rather pathos, and the two are so
delightfully blended that it is not hard to conceive why Mark Twain
stands where he does today.</p>

<p>The house was one ripple of laughter from the beginning to the
end, the only regrettable feature being that Portland only has this
one opportunity to hear him. After the fall of the curtain and the
house was thinning out, the applause was sufficient to call him
before the curtain, and a request was called out from the audience
to give the "Stammerer's Tale," which he did most graciously.</p>

<p>The audience last night was very fashionable, as well as
extremely large. Every seat in both the dress circle and balcony
was occupied, with numbers standing, and the gallery was well
filled. The lecture consisted of the following original selections
from Twain's writings: "My First Theft," "The Jumping Frog,"
"Character of the Blue Jay," "A Fancy Dress Incident," "Bit Off
More Than He Could Chew," "Tom Sawyer's Crusade," "Fighting a Duel
in Nevada," and "A Ghost Story." The entertainment consumed an hour
and a half, and at its close the lecturer took occasion to thank
his hearers for such a cordial reception on a summer evening, and
expressed his sincere gratification that hhis meeting with the
public of Portland was of such a substantial and pleasing
character.</p>
