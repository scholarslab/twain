 <b><font size="+1">THE TWAIN-CABLE COMBINATION.</font></b><br>
<br>
 A very fine audience greeted Mr. George W. Cable and Mr. Samuel L.
Clemens, at the Plymouth Church, last night, but not so large as
the one they faced when here less than a month ago. This is to be
accounted for, probably, because of the matinee in the afternoon,
when the programme was the same as that given at night, and also
because it is easy to have the taste palled with the peculiar
entertainment they give. Mr. Cable's principle selections were from
the Grandissimes, introducing the character of Ravel Innerarity,
with his wonderful picture of "Louisiana Refusing to Enter the
Union," and the announcement of his marriage as he changes boats on
the beautiful waters of Lake Catharine. The preamble to this latter
appearance of the Creole artist was a splendid bit of landscape
painting, soft and sensuous with the beauty of that Southern sky,
air and water in and about the chain of lakes forming the back
water-way between New Orleans and the gulf. He again interpolated
three of the creole love songs, and closed his part of the
programme with "Mary's Night Ride," from Dr. Sevier, a bit of
artistic work, eager and intense both in the writing and the
reading. It is much the best thing Mr. Cable gave. Mark Twain was
as funny as ever. His encounter with the newspaper interviewer, in
which he broke down that redoubtable personage with his atrocious
burlesques upon fact, put the audience in a mood to be tickled to
death with the story of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer in their
arrangement of "Jim's" escape from the cabin in accordance with the
dramatic unities of history and romance; with the mistake of the
Blue Jay, who attempted to fill up the dismantled cabin with acorns
dropped through a knot-hole in the roof; and the story of his duel
in Nevada, in which he was converted from a blood-thirsty hunter of
men into a mild and cooing dove, who, having a controversy with a
person now, would take him out quietly and talk with him, and
reason with him -- and kill him. In answer to a furious encore,
Twain gave the adventure of the miner's cat, which was blown up in
a blast, and ever afterward exhibited an unconquerable aversion to
quartz mining. As an entirety the evening was most enjoyable, and
if it seemed less full of zest than the previous one, it was
because the novelty had somewhat worn away, and not that the
performance was below standard. The general verdict was expressed
by a fair auditor in the gallery, who, while Mr. Twain was telling
of his duel, gave a long-protracted half-musical shriek, dying away
in a hysteria and a rupture of whalebone.
