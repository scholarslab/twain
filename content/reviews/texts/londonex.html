<h2>London <i>Examiner</i> [unsigned; Moncure D. Conway]<br>
 1876: June 17</h2>

<p>This newest work of Mark Twain increases the difficulty of
assigning that author a literary <i>habitat.</i> "American
humorist" has for some time been recognised as too vague a label to
attach to a writer whose "Jumping Frog" and other early sketches
have been reduced to mere fragments and ventures by such
productions as <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> and <i>The New Pilgrim's
Progress,</i> in which, while the humour is still fresh, there is
present an equal art in graphic description of natural scenery, and
a fine sense of what is genuinely impressive in the grandeurs of
the past. Those who have travelled with Mark Twain with some
curiosity to observe the effect of the ancient world interpreted by
a very shrewd eye, fresh from the newest outcome of civilisation,
may have expected to find antiquity turned into a solemn joke, but
they can hardly have failed to discover a fine discrimination
present at each step in the path of the "new pilgrim"; while he
sheds tears of a kind hardly relished by the superstitious or
sentimental over the supposed grave of his deceased parent Adam, he
can "listen deep" when any true theme from the buried world reaches
his ear. Without being pathetic he is sympathetic, and there is
also an innate refinement in his genius felt in every subject it
selects and in his treatment of it. <i>Tom Sawyer</i> carries us to
an altogether novel region, and along with these characteristics
displays a somewhat puzzling variety of abilities. There is
something almost stately in the simplicity with which he invites us
to turn our attention to the affairs of some boys and girls growing
up on the far frontiers of American civilisation. With the Eastern
Question upon us, and crowned heads arrayed on the political stage,
it may be with some surprise that we find our interest demanded in
sundry Western questions that are solving themselves through a <i>
dramatis personae</i> of humble folk whose complications occur in a
St. Petersburg situated on the Missouri river. Our manager, we feel
quite sure, would not for a moment allow us to consider that any
other St. Petersburg is of equal importance to that for which he
claims our attention. What is the deposition, death, or
enthronement of a Sultan compared with the tragical death of "Injun
Joe," the murderer, accidentally buried and entombed in the cavern
where his stolen treasures are hid? There he was <a name="a">
found.</a><br>

In such writing as this we seem to be reading some classic fable,
such as the Persian Sadi might point with his moral, "Set not your
heart on things that are transitory; the Tigris will run through
Bagdat after the race of Caliphs is extinct." Nor is this feeling
of the dignity of his subject absent when the author is describing
the most amusing incidents. Indeed, a great deal of Mark Twain's
humour consists in the serious -- or even at times severe -- style
in which he narrates his stories and portrays his scenes, as one
who feels that the universal laws are playing through the very
slightest of them. The following is a scene in which the principal
actors are a dog, a boy, and a beetle, the place being the <a name=

The scene we have selected is not so laughable, perhaps, as some
others in the volume, but it indicates very well the kind of art in
which Mark Twain is pre-eminent in our time. Every movement of boy,
beetle, and poodle, is described not merely with precision, but
with a subtle sense of meaning in every movement. Everything is
alive, and every face physiognomical. From a novel so replete with
good things, and one so full of significance, as it brings before
us what we can feel is the real spirit of home life in the far
West, there is no possibility of obtaining extracts which will
convey to the reader any idea of the purport of the book. The
scenes and characters cannot be really seen apart from their
grouping and environment. The book will no doubt be a great
favourite with boys, for whom it must in good part have been
intended; but next to boys we should say that it might be most
prized by philosophers and poets. The interior life, the everyday
experiences, of a small village on the confines of civilisation and
in the direction of its advance, may appear, antecedently, to
supply but thin material for a romance; but still it is at just
that same little pioneer point that humanity is growing with the
greatest freedom, and unfolding some of its unprescribed
tendencies. We can, indeed, hardly imagine a more felicitous task
for a man of genius to have accomplished than to have seized the
salient, picturesque, droll, and at the same time most significant
features of human life, as he has himself lived it and witnessed
it, in a region where it is continually modified in relation to new
circumstances. The chief fault of the story is its brevity, and it
will, we doubt not, be widely and thoroughly enjoyed by young and
old for its fun and its philosophy.  <a href="hompgrev.html"><img
