<p>[<i>Special to The Mirror</i>]</p>

<p>Frank Mayo's dramatization of Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson meets with the approval of a fine audience at Allen's Grand Opera House. The presentation is thoroughly pleasing in every respect. Mr. Mayo and excellent support were repeatedly honored. The first productions of the Heart of Maryland comes next.</p>
