        <p>A man may have no bad habits and have worse.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>When in doubt, tell the truth.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>It is more trouble to make a maxim than it is to do
        right.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>A dozen direct censures are easier to bear than one
        morganatic compliment.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Noise proves nothing. Often a hen who has merely laid an
        egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>He was as shy as a newspaper is when referring to its
        own merits.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us
        economize it.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>It could probably be shown by facts and figures that
        there is no distinctly native American criminal class
        except Congress.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>It is your human environment that makes climate.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Everything human is pathetic. The secret source of Humor
        itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in
        heaven.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>We should be careful to get out of an experience only
        the wisdom that is in it -- and stop there; lest we be like
        the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never
        sit down on a hot stove-lid again -- and that is well; but
        also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There are those who scoff at the schoolboy, calling him
        frivolous and shallow. Yet it was the schoolboy who said,
        "Faith is believing what you know ain't so."</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The timid man yearns for full value and demands a tenth.
        The bold man strikes for double value and compromises on
        par.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>We can secure other people's approval, if we do right
        and try hard; but our own is worth a hundred of it, and no
        way has been found out of securing that.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Truth is stranger than fiction -- to some people, but I
        am measurably familiar with it.</p>

        <p>Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because
        Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth
        isn't.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There is a Moral Sense, and there is an Immoral Sense.
        History shows us that the Moral Sense enables us to
        perceive morality and how to avoid it, and that the Immoral
        Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how to enjoy
        it.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The English are mentioned in the Bible: Blessed are the
        meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>It is easier to stay out than get out.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Pity is for the living, envy is for the dead.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have
        those three unspeakably precious things: freedom of speech,
        freedom of conscience, and the prudence never to practice
        either of them.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Man will do many things to get himself loved, he will do
        all things to get himself envied.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Nothing is so ignorant as man's left hand, except a
        lady's watch.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Be careless in your dress if you must, but keep a tidy
        soul.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There is no such thing as "the Queen's English." The
        property has gone into the hands of a joint stock company
        and we own the bulk of the shares!</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>"<i>Classic</i>." A book which people praise and don't
        read.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There are people who can do all fine and heroic things
        but one: keep from telling their happiness to the
        unhappy.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Man is the Only Animal that Blushes. Or needs to.</p>

        <p>The universal brotherhood of man is our most precious
        possession, what there is of it.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Let us be thankful for the fools. But for them the rest
        of us could not succeed.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>When people do not respect us we are sharply offended;
        yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects
        himself.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Nature makes the locust with an appetite for crops; man
        would have made him with an appetite for sand.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The spirit of wrath -- not the words -- is the sin; and
        the spirit of wrath is cursing. We begin to swear before we
        can talk.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The man with a new idea is a Crank until the idea
        succeeds.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Let us be grateful to Adam our benefactor. He cut us out
        of the "blessing" of idleness and won for us the "curse" of
        labor.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Let us not be too particular. It is better to have old
        second-hand diamonds than none at all.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The Autocrat of Russia possesses more power than any
        other man in the earth; but he cannot stop a sneeze.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There are several good protections against temptation,
        but the surest is cowardice.</p>

        <p>Names are not always what they seem. The common Welsh
        name Bzjxxllwcp is pronounced Jackson.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>To succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown;
        in the law, concealment of it will do.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Prosperity is the best protector of principle.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>By trying we can easily endure adversity. Another man's,
        I mean.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Few of us can stand prosperity. Another man's, I
        mean.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There is an old-time toast which is golden for its
        beauty. "When you ascend the hill of prosperity may you not
        meet a friend."</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Each person is born with one possession which outvalues
        all his others -- his last breath.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Hunger is the handmaid of genius.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The old saw says, "Let a sleeping dog lie." Right.
        Still, when there is much at stake it is better to get a
        newspaper to do it.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>It takes your enemy and your friend, working together,
        to hurt you to the heart; the one to slander you and the
        other to get the news to you.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>If the desire to kill and the opportunity to kill came
        always together, who would escape hanging?</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Simple rules for saving money: To save half, when you
        are fired by an eager impulse to contribute to a charity,
        wait, and count forty. To save three-quarters, count sixty.
        To save it all, count sixty-five.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Grief can take care of itself; but the get the full
        value of a joy you must have somebody to divide it
        with.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>He had had much experience of physicians, and said "the
        only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want,
        drink what you don't like, and do what you'd druther
        not."</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The man who is ostentatious of his modesty is twin to
        the statue that wears a fig-leaf.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Let me make the superstititions of a nation and I do not
        care who makes its laws or its songs either.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have
        been.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>True irreverence is disrespect for another man's
        god.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Do not undervalue the headache. While it is at its
        sharpest it seems a bad investment; but when relief begins,
        the inexpired remainder is worth four dollars a minute.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There are eight hundred and sixty-nine different forms
        of lying, but only one of them has been squarely forbidden.
        Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There are two times in a man's life when he should not
        speculate: when he can't afford it, and when he can.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>She was not quite what you would call refined. She was
        not quite what you would call unrefined. She was the kind
        of person that keeps a parrot.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Make it a point to do something every day that you don't
        want to do. This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit
        of doing your duty without pain.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Don't part with your illusions. When they are gone you
        may still exist but you have ceased to live.</p>

        <p>Often, the surest way to convey misinformation is to
        tell the strict truth.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>S<font size="-1">ATAN</font> (impatiently) to
        N<font size="-1">EW-COMER</font>. The trouble with you
        Chicago people is, that you think you are the best people
        down here; whereas you are merely the most numerous.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>In the first place God made idiots. This was for
        practice. Then He made School Boards.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>There are no people who are quite so vulgar as the
        over-refined ones.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The principle difference between a cat and a lie is that
        the cat has only nine lives.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>When your watch gets out of order you have a choice of
        two things to do: throw it in the fire or take it to the
        watch-tinker. The former is the quickest.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>In statesmanship get the formalities right, never mind
        about the moralities.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>Everyone is a moon, and has a dark side which he never
        shows to anybody.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>First catch your Boer, then kick him.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>None of us can have as many virtues as the fountain pen,
        or half its cussedness, but we can try.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>The very ink with which all history is written is merely
        fluid prejudice.</p>

        <p>There isn't a Parallel of Latitude but thinks it would
        have been the Equator if it had had its rights.</p>
        <hr width="50%" />

        <p>I have traveled more than anyone else, and I have
        noticed that even the angels speak English with an
        accent.</p>
