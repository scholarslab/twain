  THE THEATRICAL WEEK. Thumb-Marks and Dog-Ears and Hypnotized
  Trilby. PUDDIN'HEAD WILSON'S WHIMS.<br />

  <p>No doubt "Puddin'head Wilson" is the play of last week that
  will have the longest life and, in the end, the greatest fame. It
  is not a particularly good play, speaking according to rule, for
  it is absurdly ill made, and full of superfluous stuff. Who are
  the twins, anyway, and why did they go to Dawson? They look like
  a new kind of "song and dance team," and doubtless they have
  meaning and identity--but in order to understand them one would
  be compelled to read Mark Twain's very latest story, and that is
  expecting too much of anybody.</p>

  <p>People stopped reading Twain with zest after "Huckleberry
  Finn." That was the last flower of his genius in the eye of the
  public. Of course, to him belongs the credit of creating the
  character of Lawyer Wilson and the man who wanted to know what on
  earth Lawyer Wilson could go with half a dog; and what possible
  legal defense he could make after he had killed his half, in the
  suit for damages brought by the owner of the other half, which
  would surely die. Mark Twain's sense of humor is still potent.
  But after merely glancing through his stories of the hustler at
  the Court of King Arthur and the bank-note wager, the multitude
  found that he belonged to a past generation. Everybody has read
  "Trilby" [a competing play playing in New York] and everybody
  else pretends to know all about it; but positively nobody, except
  a few tens of thousands of voracious readers of all sorts of
  fiction, know Mark Twain's story of "Puddin'head Wilson."
  Wherefore an elliptical "dramatization" of the story, in the
  manner of John Brougham, was a mistake.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mayo has not measurably improved upon such plays as
  Brougham's "Dombey &amp; Son." He has, to be sure, invented a
  sentimental "element"; but he has not made nearly enough of the
  emotional side of Chambers. A strong scene in which that
  supposititious [sic] darky, thirty-one parts Caucasian and one
  part Ethiopian, should boldly declare his passion for Roxy, human
  nature asserting itself in spite of prejudice and environment,
  would vastly improve the play. Chambers is by birth white and
  aristocratic. Following Mark Twain, Mr. Mayo has made the pseudo
  Thomas a Becket a glaring example of the influence of inherited
  traits. He is vicious, because of a training antagonistic to his
  nature, cringing and cowardly. Similarly Chambers, on his part,
  might well develop other traits than courage and honesty. The
  domineering spirit of a race of rulers might show itself in
  him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayo is sometimes too profusely explanatory; at others he
  depends too much on a general knowledge of the story of his play.
  As an after-thought it may be stated, as the opinion of one
  peculiarly gifted in the matter of hind-sight, that the prologue
  in 1836 is quite unnecessary. It established the fact that Roxy,
  an octoroon slave, had charge of two children, both by the same
  father, and of one of which she was the mother, and that she sent
  the wrong one to the christening. This could be explained in a
  few words. In the first act the robberies have been discovered,
  and Puddin'head Wilson was [sic--probably "has"] his clue, before
  the twins arrive in Dawson. He tells his sister of the darky girl
  who climbed into Tom's room, and the subsequent apparition of
  Tom's face at the window. The arrival of the Italians and their
  installation as boarders at Puddin'head's are later incidents of
  the act. Yet we are solemnly informed afterward that the
  wonderful knife, with a history, was stolen from the twins on the
  night before Puddin'head got his clue.</p>

  <p>There are droll moments in the first three acts, and one
  strong scene, before the ruined mill, but nearly all the genuine
  strength and vital interest of the play are condensed in the last
  act, which is admirable. The play will probably grow in
  popularity in its present shape; but it would have a still better
  chance if Mr. Mayo would boldly employ a practical playwright to
  help him make it over, dispensing with the prologue and the
  jesting scene about the twins before they have been seen by the
  townspeople; and making the love of Chambers for Rowy [sic] a
  stronger element.</p>

  <p>It deserves a chance, for Mr. Mayo's portrayal of Puddin'head,
  the slow-going, sagacious philosopher and humorist, is one of the
  best pieces of character acting we have seen in many a day, and
  the acting of Miss Shaw, Mr. Henley, Mr. Edgar Davenport, Mr.
  Odell Williams, Mr. Whiting, Miss Graham, Mr. Harry Davenport,
  and, for that matter, all the others, is uncommonly vivid and
  effective.</p><br />

  <a href="pwact.jpg">Herald's Sketch of the Last Act</a>

  <p>The unquestionable success of the dramatization of Mark
  Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead [sic] Wilson," by Mr. Frank Mayo, may
  be credited very largely to the individual work as an actor of
  Mr. Mayo himself. That fact should not diminish in any way the
  full meed of praise due him for his work as a dramatist as well,
  for out of a book full of epigrams but meagre and diffuse in plot
  he has constructed a play of coherent dramatic interest.</p>

  <p>He has turned conversation into action--not accomplished as
  great a transformation as might be desired, perhaps, but still
  done wonders. It is safe to say that everybody who has witnessed
  the performance at the Herald Square Theatre during the past week
  has been agreeably surprised.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayo plays the part of Pudd'n'head [sic], a role that
  dominates the whole story. Mr. Mayo is an old actor, with many
  successes to point back at, from "Davy Crockett" on, but in none
  of them have his artistic abilities shown more brightly than they
  do in the impersonation of the long suffering, clear headed,
  sunny tempered and witty "Pudd'n'head [sic] Wilson." There is a
  certain slow smoothness and dry humor about his work that is
  delightful. Even that well worn story of wishing to own half of
  an obnoxious dog, so that he could kill his half, sounds fresh
  and new again as he tells it.</p>

  <p>Even the ladies in the audience laughed when he
  said:--"Circumstantial evidence is generally wrong. You see a
  woman sharpen a pencil. You know she did it with a knife. If you
  didn't see her you would be willing to swear she did it with her
  teeth."</p>

  <p>The play is a novelty in that it depicts life in the Southwest
  at an era never before utilized by dramatists. The art of the
  actors and the cleverness of the costumers have done much toward
  making this a strong feature. The evils and characteristics of
  slavery days were perhaps never more honestly and justly set
  forth.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayo has been very fortunate in the selection of his
  supporting company. ... [transition to another review].</p><br />
  New York Tribune<br />
  16 April 1895<br />

  <p>Mr. Frank Mayo appeared last night at the Herald Square
  Theatre before a small audience in the initial production of his
  dramatization of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson." The audience
  seemed to be made up largely of the friends of the actor, an
  observation which applies, in point of time, only to the prologue
  and a portion of the first act. After everybody in the house had
  become the intimate of Pudd'head, and the demonstrations of
  approval, at first merely friendly, became enthusiastic. Mr.
  Mayo's dramatization has preserved the flavor of the author's
  humor, and a real character walks the stage in the person of the
  client and [? microfilm marred] country lawyer, with his shrewd
  philosophy and his contempt for the village blockheads who have
  made him the butt of their bucolic wit.</p>

  <p>The play is sufficiently melodramatic to give Mr. Mayo
  opportunity to employ the methods with which his long experience
  has made him familiar. If anything, it suffers from a little too
  much plot, involving a little too much "talky" explication; yet
  this defect is easily susceptible of correction. The action
  hinges upon an identification by means of the thumbmarks of two
  persons, the scientific study of which has been Pudd'nhead's
  hobby. This identification brings his enemies to confusion and
  the play to a triumphant close. One of the most effective
  situations is that at the close of the third act, when the
  investigator believes his cherished theory exploded, its
  effectiveness being gained by its extreme simplicity. Wilson's
  forensic oratory in the last act, also, is excellently conceived,
  having neither too much nor too little of the spirit of the
  backwoods advocate. Mr. Mayo was supported by a competent
  company. Miss Mary Shaw as Roxy, the white slave-mother, acted
  with force and generally with good judgment. Mr. Henley was
  weighted down with the part of a very bad villain. Most of the
  actors were remarkably consistent in the use of their Southern
  accents. The play is a refreshing contrast to so much that has
  been produced upon the New York stage this season in that it is
  absolutely decent.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mayo was obliged to respond to repeated curtain calls
  during the progress of the play, and at its close was obliged to
  speak his acknowledgements. He read the following dispatch from
  Mark Twain: "Cable me the jury's verdict." The audience cried in
  answer: "A success!"</p><br />

  <p>To-morrow will begin the second week of "Pudd'nhead Wilson,"
  Frank Mayo's dramatization of Mark Twain's novel, at the Herald
  Square Theatre. The play is mounted in a lavish manner, the
  scenery having been painted for this production under the
  personal direction of the manager, Mr. Evans. The engagement is
  for six weeks.</p><br />
