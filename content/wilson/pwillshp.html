          <p>MT had hoped to bring out <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>
          with his own publishing company, but by the time the new
          novel was ready Webster &amp; Company had gone into
          bankruptcy. (Its last title was <i>Tom Sawyer Abroad</i>,
          which was copyrighted on the same day, 18 April 1894,
          that the publishing company officially failed.) Shortly
          after that MT arranged with Frank Bliss, Elisha's son, to
          publish <i>Pudd'nhead</i> with the American Publishing
          Company, the old subscription firm he had left twelve
          years earlier.</p>

          <p>Living in Europe and distracted with his financial
          problems, MT may have had little to do with the actual
          production of the novel. <i>The Century</i> used one of
          its staff artists, Louis Loeb, to illustrate the story
          for magazine publication; Chatto &amp; Windus used Loeb's
          drawings when they published the novel (without "Those
          Extraordinary Twins") in England. <i>The Century</i> also
          used <a href="javascript:Start6('pwcent2.html')">a
          photograph of MT</a> to accompany the first installment
          (in December, 1893) that both the American and English
          first editions also used.</p>

          <p>The American Publishing Company supplied the copious
          pictures subscription buyers expected with a technique
          that had never before been used for a MT text: "marginal
          illustrations." As done by two artists named F.M. Senior
          and C.H. Warren, this mode of illustration has a couple
          very decided consequences. It shrinks all the characters
          to cartoon-size, keeping their antics and anguishes at a
          great distance from the reader's sympathy. And although
          the text treats racial identity as a deep ambiguity, this
          mode of illustration, because it makes shading
          impossible, forces the illustrator to depict a character
          as either as white as the page or as black as the ink. In
          a brief review, <i>The New York Times</i> praised these
          illustrations, but how MT felt about them and the decided
          effect they must have had on contemporary readers'
          reaction to the novel is unknown to me.</p>

          <p>Five years later, E.W. Kemble did a set of
          illustrations that were used in two new editions. The
          American Publishing Company brought out <i>Pudd'nhead
          Wilson and Those Extraordinary Twins</i> as Vol. 14 of
          its upscale "&Eacute;dition de Luxe" of <i>The Writings
          of Mark Twain</i>, which was limited to 1000 numbered
          copies; this included six drawings by Kemble. Harper
          &amp; Brothers, which bought most of MT's copyrights
          after his bankruptcy, used two of these drawings in its
          "Harper's Library Edition," also published in 1899. As
          Werner Sollors has recently pointed out, how readers in
          1899 "saw" Roxy might have depended on which of these
          editions they owned. Both include "Roxy Harvesting Among
          [the] Kitchens," in which the most visible woman, and the
          one who, because she is holding a basket, seems to be
          "harvesting" food, looks like the "Aunt Jemima"
          stereotype rather than the "majestic" character whom MT's
          text says is "as white as anybody." Purchasers of the
          "&Eacute;dition de Luxe," however, would have seen the
          second, later drawing called "Roxy Among the Field
          Hands," in which she appears, if not "white," at least
          mulatto -- and so those readers may have gone back to the
          earlier illustration and found Roxy where Kemble has
          almost hidden her, behind the right shoulder of the black
          man in "Harvesting Among the Kitchens." How many readers
          of the mass market Harper's edition even noticed this
          strangely disembodied figure lurking in the background is
          not clear, but given white America's preconceptions about
          both female slaves and Kemble's typical representations
          of "negroes" (see <a href="../huckfinn/hucillhp.html">his
          drawings for the first edition</a> of <i>Huck Finn</i>),
          it would probably have been easier for them to overlook
          the discrepancies between MT's description of Roxy and
          Kemble's woman with the basket than to find and identify
          the other woman in that picture. While "Among the Field
          Hands" seems never to have been republished, various
          publishers used "Roxy Harvesting" as the frontispiece for
          <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> in hundreds of thousands of
          copies sold between 1899 and World World II. I have not
          found any evidence that anyone during all that time
          raised any questions about it as a representation of Roxy
          -- in which case it could serve as visual proof of the
          point that MT makes so often in his writing, about how
          easy it is for people who have been culturally
          conditioned, or "trained," to see what isn't there.</p>
