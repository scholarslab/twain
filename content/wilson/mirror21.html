<p>Frank Mayo in Pudd'nhead Wilson&ndash;Bobby Gaylor&ndash;Julia Neilson Indisposed&ndash;Notes.</p>

<p>[<i>Special to The Mirror</i>]</p>

<p>Comedy to suit all tastes is the rule at the playhouses to-night. At the Euclid, that starling actor Frank mayo is seem in the title role of his dramatization of Pudd'nhead Wilson. He has a strong supporting company. The Euclid Avenue Opera House has its usual representative Monday night audience. The play seems to five satisfaction, and will undoubtedly do a flattering business. 1492 comes next week, followed by Olga Nethersole in Carmen.</p>
