        chapters after Tom sells Roxy back into slavery, she
        re-appears in St. Louis, having escaped from the Arkansas
        plantation. Disguised as a man in blackface, she angrily
        tells him what she's been through, and although it is told
        rather than shown, this indirect 5-page account is the most
        emotionally charged description of the horrors of slavery
        in all MT's work.<br />
        Jealous of her good looks, the plantation mistress sends
        Roxy "out to de quarter 'mongst de common fiel' han's" and
        orders the overseer to be especially harsh to her. Roxy
        describes the man who bought her as "good enough, as
        planters goes," but both the mistress and the overseer are
        Yanks, "outen New England', en anybody down South kin tell
        you what dat mean. <i>Dey</i> knows how to work a nigger to
        death, en dey knows how to whale 'em too." In these two
        illustrations we see the overseer administering two of the
        many lashings Roxy suffers.<br />
