        According to Jerry's narrative, "none of de Tarl'ton
        niggers ebber been selled afoah," but when "Marse Jeems"
        goes broke he is forced to auction off all his property. He
        and Jerry work together, however, to rig the auction so
        that Jerry will be able to buy his wife, Malviny, with the
        little money he has. In this version of the "old
        plantation," even a slave auction is an occasion to show
        how generous and kind masters were, and how grateful were
        their slaves.<br />
