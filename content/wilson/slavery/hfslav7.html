        When the King and Duke come on board the raft, Huck tells
        them that he owns Jim, but has to travel by nights because
        "people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take
        Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway."
        While the King cons the camp-meeting at Pokeville, the Duke
        prints up this counterfeit wanted poster, identifying Jim
        as having run away from a plantation below New Orleans. The
        Duke says it will give them a cover story for their
        travels, allowing them to pretend they're taking Jim south
        for the reward; later the pair use it to con the Phelpses
        into buying Jim for $40 with the intention of collecting
        the reward.<br />
        MT's older contemporary readers would have recognized how
        Kemble derived the Duke's poster from the standard way by
        which fugitive slaves were advertised in ante bellum
        newspapers and wanted posters.<br />
