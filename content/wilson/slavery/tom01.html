        "Down on his knees" -- that's the phrase Huck uses to
        locate Jim when they meet in Chapter 8. One of the most
        conspicuous patterns in the way white America represented
        slaves throughout the 19th century is how often they are
        shown kneeling to a white person. This illustration is one
        of the several hundred that Hammatt Billings drew for a
        "deluxe" edition of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, Harriet
        Beecher Stowe's 1852 anti-slavery protest and runaway
        best-seller. In this scene Tom, "turning suddenly round and
        falling on his knees," is pleading with Augustine St.
        Clare, his "master" in New Orleans, to give up alcohol,
        because of what the "good Book says."<br />
