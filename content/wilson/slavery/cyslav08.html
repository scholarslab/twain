        <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> actually includes an account of
        slaves violently rising up and killing their owner. Hank
        isn't there to see it himself, and so it's indirectly
        narrated afterwards, but he does see and describe the dead
        man: "I was soon at the slave quarters. Empty--everybody
        gone! That is, everybody except one body--the
        slave-master's. It lay there all battered to pulp." The
        slaves that killed him (including the unrecognized Arthur)
        are condemned to die by hanging, but during the execution
        Arthur, Hank and most of the slaves are saved when
        Launcelot and the other knights ride to the rescue on
        bicycles. Typical of the novel's ambiguities is what, if
        anything, this pair of incidents -- a slave revolt and the
        rescue from lynching -- implies about American race
        relations.<br />
