        The white man here is a master, Percy Driscoll, who is
        threatening to sell all his slaves "<font size="-1">DOWN
        THE RIVER</font>" if the one who took two dollars does not
        confess. "Roxy reeled in her tracks and the color vanished
        out of her face; the others dropped to their knees as if
        they had been shot; tears gushed from their eyes, their
        supplicating hands went up," and, after they confess,
        Driscoll promises only to "sell you <i>here</i> though you
        don't deserve it. You ought to be sold down the
        river."<br />
        In this passage the narrator makes one of MT's strongest
        published statements about the rights and wrongs of slaves,
        saying that when a slave steals from "the man who daily
        robbed him of an inestimable treasure--his liberty--he was
        not committing any sin that God would remember against him
        in the Last Great Day."<br />
