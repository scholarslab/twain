        After the Evasion has been played out, Tom reveals that
        Miss Watson (feeling guilty about having considered selling
        Jim down the river) freed him in her will. Tom expresses no
        guilt about the way he has withheld that knowledge and used
        Jim himself, but he does give Jim $40 "for being prisoner
        for us so patient." This Kemble illustration may be meant
        simply to represent those narrative facts, although the way
        the figures are posed and the caption also suggest the
        drawing is intended to evoke the larger end of the story of
        slavery, the Emancipation brought about by the Civil War.
        In the narrative Huck says that Jim was "pleased most to
        death" with Tom's $40 -- and this is the only illustration
        in which he is shown simply smiling.<br />
