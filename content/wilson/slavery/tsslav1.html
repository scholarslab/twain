        three boys in Aunt Polly's house: Tom, his half-brother
        Sid, and "Jim," whom the narrator introduces in Chapter 1
        as "the small colored boy." This and the next illustration
        appear on facing pages in Chapter 2, after which Jim
        disappears from novel entirely.<br />
        Jim is based on Sandy, a slave purchased by Sam Clemens'
        parents from "a master back in the country" when Sam was
        about Tom's age. MT mentions Sandy in one of the
        autobiographical dictations he did in the early years of
        the 20th century as an example of his mother's sympathetic
        heart. When Sam complained about Sandy's constant singing
        around the house, Jane Clemens reminded her son that Sandy
        had been "sold away from his mother," and to her the
        singing was "a sign he is not grieving." Whether we believe
        she was right, this anecdote reminds us of what <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i> is <i>not</i> representing about someone like
        Jim.<br />
