        By the end of <i>On the Plantation</i>, Lee has
        surrendered, slavery has been abolished, and "the old
        things had passed away." The illustration here refers to
        the effects of Sherman's march on the population of middle
        Georgia: "The people that Joe saw went about with anxious
        faces, and even the negroes were frightened." We learn a
        few pages later that the many of the younger slaves had
        followed the Federal army away toward freedom, but even at
        the end of the War "some of the older negroes were in their
        accustomed places." The slave cabins stand empty, "but the
        old plantation days still live in [Joe's] dreams."<br />
