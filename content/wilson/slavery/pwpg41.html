        After hearing her master's threat to sell his slaves
        "<font size="-1">DOWN THE RIVER</font>," Roxy is seized by
        a "profound terror"; "crazed with horror," she thinks first
        of killing her baby (and herself) to save him such a fate,
        then conceives her plan to switch her for her master's
        infant. Chapter 3 tells the story of her actions on the
        first night of the novel with great power, keeping the
        reader's focus on Roxy's love for her child and despair at
        her circumstances. We are a long way from the "sleepy" and
        "contented" town of the opening description. On the other
        hand, the illustrator felt the margin of the first page of
        Chapter 3 was a fit place to introduce the (unauthorized)
        image of a slave chasing a butterfly.<br />
