        </center>MT's last travel book recounts his trip around the
        world in 1895, which took him through much of Britain's
        colonial empire. One of the book's major themes is the
        exploitation of the native population in countries like
        Australia and New Zealand, which is several times referred
        to as a form of "slavery." The text that Beard's drawing
        here illustrates, for example, talks about how "In many
        countries we [the whites] have taken the savage's land from
        him, and made him our slave, and lashed him every day, and
        broken his pride, and made death his only friend."<br />
        &#x00A0; American slavery is mentioned only twice in the
        text, however. The first time is when MT witnesses a hotel
        servant struck by his European employer in Bombay, and is
        carried back fifty years into his own past:<br />
        <br />
        " . . . I had not seen the like of this for fifty years. It
        carried me back to my boyhood, and flashed upon me the
        forgotten fact that this was the <i>usual</i> way of
        explaining one's desires to a slave. I was able to remember
        that the method seemed right and natural to me in those
        days, I being born to it and unaware that elsewhere there
        were other methods; but I was also able to remember that
        those unresented cuffings made me sorry for the victim and
        ashamed for the punisher. My father was a refined and
        kindly gentleman, very grave, rather austere, of rigid
        probity, a sternly just and upright man, albeit he attended
        no church and never spoke of religious matters, and had no
        part nor lot in the pious joys of his Presbyterian family,
        nor ever seemed to suffer from this deprivation. He laid
        his hand upon me in punishment only twice in his life, and
        then not heavily; once for telling him a lie -- which
        surprised me, and showed me how unsuspicious he was, for
        that was not my maiden effort. He punished me those two
        times only, and never any other member of the family at
        all; yet every now and then he cuffed our harmless slave
        boy, Lewis, for trifling little blunders and awkardnesses.
        My father had passed his life among the slaves from his
        cradle up, and his cuffings proceeded from the custom of
        the time, not from his nature. When I was ten years old I
        saw a man fling a lump of iron-ore at a slaveman in anger,
        for merely doing something awkwardly -- as if that were a
        crime. It bounded from the man's skull, and the man fell
        and never spoke again. He was dead in an hour. I knew the
        man had a right to kill his slave if he wanted to, and yet
        it seemed a pitiful thing and somehow wrong, though why
        wrong I was not deep enough to explain if I had been asked
        to do it. Nobody in the village approved of that murder,
        but of course no one said much about it.<br />
        &#x00A0; "It is curious -- the space-annihilating power of
        thought. For just one second, all that goes to make the
        <i>me</i> in me was in a Missourian village, on the other
        side of the globe, vividly seeing again these forgotten
        pictures of fifty years ago, and wholly unconscious of all
        things but just those; and in the next second I was back in
        Bombay, and that kneeling native's smitten cheek was not
        done tingling yet!"<br />
        <br />
        The book's other mention of American slavery occurs in the
        context of MT's indictment of Cecil Rhodes' administration
        in southern Africa:<br />
        <br />
        &#x00A0; "The great bulk of the savages must go. The white
        man wants their lands, and all must go excepting such
        percentage of them as he will need to do his work for him
        upon terms to be determined by himself. Since history has
        removed the element of guesswork from this matter and made
        it certainty, the humanest way of diminishing the black
        population should be adopted, not the old cruel ways of the
        past. Mr. Rhodes and his gang have been following the old
        ways. -- They are chartered to rob and slay, and they
        lawfully do it, but not in a compassionate and Christian
        spirit. They rob the Mashonas and the Matabeles of a
        portion of their territories in the hallowed old style of
        'purchase!' for a song, and then they force a quarrel and
        take the rest by the strong hand. They rob the natives of
        their cattle under the pretext that all the cattle in the
        country belonged to the king whom they have tricked and
        assassinated. They issue 'regulations' requiring the
        incensed and harassed natives to work for the white
        settlers, and neglect their own affairs to do it. This is
        slavery, and is several times worse than was the American
        slavery which used to pain England so much; for when this
        Rhodesian slave is sick, super- annuated, or otherwise
        disabled, he must support himself or starve -- his master
        is under no obligation to support him."<br />
