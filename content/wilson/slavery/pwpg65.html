        Miss Watson sets Jim free in her will after the Widow tries
        to prevent her from selling him down the river, Roxy is
        manumitted by Percy Driscoll's will. A month earlier,
        Percy's brother, Judge Driscoll, "bought Chambers. He had
        heard that Tom had been trying to get his father to sell
        the boy down the river, and he wanted to prevent the
        scandal--for public sentiment did not approve of that way
        of treating family servants for light cause or for no
        cause." This is the image which accompanies that text, and
        which draws a similarly benign picture of slavery: the
        Judge reaches out to both "Tom" and "Chambers," whose
        symmetrical postures and identical clothing suggest a
        family grouping.<br />
        &#x00A0; This theme of happy families is echoed in the page's
        other illustration, of birds flocking together. There is no
        direct textual basis for the picture, but the margins of
        <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> contain a number of these pastoral
        images.<br clear="left" />
