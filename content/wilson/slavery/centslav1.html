        "How Sal Came Through," by H. S. Edwards, is a comedy set
        among the slaves on the "Holly Bluff plantation," owned by
        Col. Tom Broome (who you see with his granddaughter in this
        picture). Sal would have "come through" (been saved during
        a revival meeting) if she hadn't seen M'ria, her rival for
        the affections of Alec, right at the climax of the
        religious ceremony . . .<br />
