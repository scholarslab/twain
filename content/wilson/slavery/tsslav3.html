        Convinced that no one loves him, Tom strikes a melancholy
        pose under Becky Thatcher's window -- until "a
        maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm" as
        she empties a pitcher on his head. The text calls the maid
        a "servant," and Williams' drawing leaves her race
        indeterminate, but in Hannibal such a servant would almost
        certainly have been a black slave. The text strikes another
        discordant note, though I think most readers overlook it,
        when Tom reacts by throwing something at the maid, a
        "missile" heavy enough to break the glass in the window.
        Throwing a rock at a woman seems out of character for Tom,
        and it's not clear how the woman's status, either as
        "servant" or a slave, qualifies his act.<br />
