        The experience of being enslaved soon leads Arthur to
        become an abolitionist: "We had a rough time for a month,
        tramping to and fro in the earth, and suffering. And what
        Englishman was the most interested in the slavery question
        by that time? His grace the king! Yes, from being the most
        indifferent, he was become the most interested. He was
        become the bitterest hater of the institution I ever heard
        talk."<br />
