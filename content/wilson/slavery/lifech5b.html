        The passage this second picture of the mate illustrates
        reads: "When he was getting out cargo at a landing, I was
        always where I could see and hear. . . . I wished I could
        talk like that." One thing we see in the illustration
        that's not in the text is the crew of slaves who are
        actually doing the work, and in this picture they're
        clearly not as "happy" as in the previous one. This picture
        even evokes the familiar Anti-Slavery images of drivers
        dominating field slaves, and thus goes much further toward
        depicting slavery negatively than MT's words do.<br />
