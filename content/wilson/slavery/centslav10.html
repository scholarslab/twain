        This tale was written by Virginia Frazer Boyle, but
        entirely narrated in "blackvoice" by Jerry, who tells an
        unidentified auditory about the time, in "dos times afoah
        de wah," he bought his own wife at a slave auction. In this
        first illustration we see Jerry (who has been freed by his
        master, "Marse Jeems," after Jerry saved the cotton crop
        from burning up) courting Malviny, "ole Miss's maid."<br />
