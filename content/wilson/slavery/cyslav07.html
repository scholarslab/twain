        This is another instance of Dan Beard, in his
        illustrations, creating additional meanings for the story
        MT has Hank tell in his words. All MT's contemporary
        readers would immediately have recognized that this slave
        driver looks exactly like financier Jay Gould, one of the
        notorious robber barons from the period. Whether they would
        also have recognized the driver's victim as in any way
        emblematic of the millions of blacks who were enslaved
        before the Civil War was, I think, much less likely.<br />
