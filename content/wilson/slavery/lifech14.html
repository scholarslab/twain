        The June installment of "Old Times" focuses on the "rank
        and dignity" steamboatmen had along the river, and contains
        the narrative's first (oblique) acknowledgment that crews
        were made up of "[n]egro firemen, deckhands and barbers."
        The scene depicted here reflects what "[s]omebody saw and
        heard" on one of the "back streets" of New Orleans: "A
        middle-aged negro woman projected her head through a broken
        pane and shouted (very willing that the neighbors should
        hear and envy), 'You Mary Ann, come in de house dis minute!
        Stannin' out dah foolin' 'long wid dat low trash, an'
        heah's de barber off'n de "Gran' Turk" wants to conwerse
        wid you!'" Both the text here and the picture use the
        conventions of minstrel humor to depict slave life,
        including the mispronunciation of genteel words
        ("converse") and the comic inflation of their pretentions
        (the belief that barber is a distinguished social rank).
        That this scene was seen by an anonymous "somebody" keeps
        white readers very far away from the world these blacks
        inhabit.<br />
