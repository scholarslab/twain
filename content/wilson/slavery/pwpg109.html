        MT was an iconoclast, and this image seems powerfully to
        attack or reconstruct the familiar icon of the kneeling
        slave/standing master. As Roxy, "the heir of two centuries
        of unatoned insult and outrage, look[s] down on" her
        supposed master, "Tom Driscoll," she says: "Fine nice young
        white gen'l'man kneelin' down to a nigger-wench! I's wanted
        to see dat jes once befo' I's called." It's impossible to
        blame her for wanting to see the stereotype subverted, but
        it's also, finally, hard to see the image in such
        revisonary terms. "Tom" is in fact her son, as "black" as
        she is, and a slave, and by switching babies in the cradle
        Roxy herself created the "fiction" of Tom's status as a
        white master, so this reversal of roles can hardly atone
        for 200 years of whites enslaving blacks. And visually it's
        impossible to see race in this image at all. This image is
        another example of how difficult it is to "see" what MT's
        books are saying or suggesting about American slavery as a
        fact of our history.<br />
