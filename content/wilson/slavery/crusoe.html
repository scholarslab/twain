        Huck's encounter of Jim on Jackson's Island begins with his
        shocking discovery of a campfire, a scene that certainly
        echoes the famous moment when Robinson Crusoe, after years
        alone on <i>his</i> island, discovers a human footprint.
        Defoe's novel was originally published in 1719; throughout
        the 19th century it maintained its popular status, and was
        repeatedly reprinted, often with new illustrations, in both
        England and the U.S. One of the most often illustrated
        scenes is the moment when Crusoe, having rescued a man from
        cannibals, tells him his name is "Friday" -- "I likewise
        taught him to say Master, and then let him know that was to
        be my name." Friday's posture is described as "antic," and
        especially "humble" and "thankful": he "made all the signs
        to me of subjection, servitude, and submission
        imaginable."<br />
        This typical representation of that scene, from an American
        edition of <i>Crusoe</i> brought out twenty years before
        <i>Huck</i> was published, suggests Kemble and MT's readers
        may have remembered it when seeing how Jim falls on his
        knees to Huck.
