      <td>&#x00A0; The ongoing challenges to <i>Huck Finn</i> as
      racist in its representation of slavery and African Americans
      have prompted a heightened scholarly interest in trying to
      determine exactly what Samuel Clemens' ideas on those
      subjects were. All accounts agree that his ideas changed
      drastically over time. Although the Missouri he grew up in
      never joined the Confederacy, it was a world in which slavery
      was taken for granted by most whites, defended by all public
      institutions, including the churches, and attacked out loud
      by no one; Sam's own parents owned slaves. The Langdon family
      his wife belonged to, on the other hand, was actively
      abolitionist, and by the time Sam married into it at the
      start of his career the U.S. had abolished slavery. As an
      owner/editor of the Buffalo <i>Express</i> in 1869 he wrote
      and printed an unsigned editorial protesting the recent
      lynching of a black man in Memphis; in 1881 he wrote
      President-elect Garfield a letter on behalf of Frederick
      Douglass; in 1885, in acknowledgment of the rights of former
      slaves to reparation for the wrongs that white America had
      done them, he arranged to help support an African American
      named Warner T. McGuinn through Yale law school. (You can see MT's
<a href="../../sc_as_mt/slclemens.html">letter to Garfield</a> in the <font size="-1">SAM CLEMENS AS MARK TWAIN</font> section of the archive.  The best
      account of slavery in Sam Clemens' Hannibal is <i>Searching
      for Jim</i>, by Terrell Dempsey [2003]; a representative
      account of how the adult Samuel Clemens personally thought
      and talked about slavery and race is <i>Lighting Out for the
      Territory</i>, by Shelley Fisher Fishkin [1997].)<br />

      &#x00A0; But when Twainians cite these kinds of biographical
      facts to answer the critique of <i>Huck Finn</i>, they
      overlook the crucial distinction between what Sam Clemens
      thought or did in private (what we know about his personal
      life), and what "Mark Twain" wrote or what "the writings of
      Mark Twain" say (what his audience saw in his published
      books). The end of slavery did not mean America was finished
      with such questions as <i>what was slavery like?</i> or
      <i>what does its existence mean about our past?</i> Most of
      MT's major writings are set in slave-owning societies -- how
      do they re-present slavery for an American reading public
      that was struggling to come to terms with slavery, indeed
      that continues to be be haunted by those questions
      today?<br />&#x00A0; For his contemporaries, MT's books
      were made of pictures as well as words, and for many of those
      readers the pictures would have spoken at least as loudly as
      the words. This page brings together some of MT's published
      words about slavery with many of the pictures that appeared
      in the first editions of his books. My goal is to give you a
      way to see the images of slavery that readers in his times
      saw through the windows onto that world that his books gave
      them.<br /></td>

      <td>&#x00A0; MT's first contribution to <i>The Atlantic
      Monthly</i> was also his first substantial representation of
      the experience of slavery. In "<b>A True Story, Repeated Word
      for Word as I Heard It</b>" (November 1874), "Misto C----"
      listens as Aunt Rachel tells him "all 'bout slavery." Her
      story begins with an account of the horrifying auction in
      Richmond at which she and her seven children were sold apart,
      and ends when, near the end of the Civil War, she was
      reunited with her youngest son, now a soldier in a "colored
      regiment" in the Union Army. Although some of its original
      readers, knowing it was "By Mark Twain," apparently kept
      looking for a joke in it, it is a moving story, and <a href=
      "../../huckfinn/trustoryhp.html"><font size="-1">THE
      MANUSCRIPT</font></a> shows how seriously MT worked to get
      Rachel's voice right. He reprinted the story in <i>Sketches,
      New and Old</i> (1875), where True Williams' illustration of
      Rachel <i>at left</i> appeared.<br />

      the series of sketches about his experiences as an apprentice
      steamboat pilot on "the Southern trade" in the late 1850s.
      These were published in seven installments between January
      and July, 1875, under the title "Old Times on the
      Mississippi." Rooted in nostalgia for the riverboats' "days
      of glory," MT's narrative almost completely ignores the role
      slavery played in steamboating -- that the boats' crews were
      mainly slaves, and that slaves as well as cotton were their
      staple cargoes. Mr. Bixby, who plays master pilot to the
      narrator's cub, lands a steamboat at a plantation in the
      pitch dark as an example of his prowess, but the darkness
      also makes both the plantation and the slave who waits on the
      shore invisible -- we can only hear "a darky's voice" saying
      "'Gimme de k'yarpet-bag, Mars' Jones.'" The <i>Atlantic</i>
      texts were unillustrated, but MT incorporated the sketches
      into <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> (1883), where the
      illustrations <i>below</i>, by John Harley, show how this
      version of the "Old Times" represented slavery:<br /></td>

      <td>&#x00A0; The word "slave" appears twice in MT's first
      fiction about the world of his childhood, in the Preface and
      in a footnote. In the text of the novel itself we meet Jim,
      identified only as Aunt Polly's "small colored boy," and hear
      about the unnamed "negro" who has just taught Tom a new way
      to whistle, about the "[w]hite, mulatto and negro boys and
      girls" who congregate at the town pump, and about "Uncle
      Jake," "Ben Roger's . . . pap's nigger." But slavery is
      barely mentioned. When the narrator talks about "captivity
      and fetters," he's referring to Tom having to go to school,
      and he uses the slogan of the Anti-Slavery movement -- "Am I
      not a man and a brother, without distinction of color" -- to
      make a joke about the way Tom's face looks after his sister
      Mary has washed it. More than Polly's fence gets white-washed
      in the story, but evading the presence of slavery is one of
      the most powerful means by which MT's story creates such an
      inviting past for his readers' nostalgia to inhabit. (For

      <td>&#x00A0; When MT next goes back to St. Petersburg, slavery
      plays a much larger role in the story he tells, but how
      <i>Huck Finn</i> represents slaves and slavery remains a very
      controversial question. Throughout the novel Huck (as someone
      who's been raised in a slave-holding society) believes
      slavery is right; though he likes Jim and is willing to "go
      to hell" to "steal Jim out of slavery," he expresses more
      sympathy for Miss Watson as the "poor old woman" who owns Jim
      than for Jim himself. By 1885, slavery had been abolished for
      two decades, so nearly every contemporary reader would see
      Huck's belief in its eternal rightness ironically, as an
      example of another kind of "slavery" -- the way a child's
      mind is captive to the values of the society she or he is
      born into.<br />
      &#x00A0; But even after slavery has been abolished, there
      remains the problem of understanding what it was like, what
      its legacy is, what it says about the nation's culture. And
      what remains ambiguous about the novel is the way it presents
      slavery: the idea of slavery that its words and pictures
      leave in the minds of its readers. From the first edition's
      174 drawings by E. W. Kemble, who was picked by MT himself to
      illustrate the novel, I selected the 16 <i>below</i> as
      representative of the way contemporary readers were shown the
      slave-owning society through which Huck and Jim

    <tr>
      <td>&#x00A0; About 10 years after finishing <i>Huck Finn</i> MT
      decided to go back again imaginatively to the world of his
      childhood. The story he wound up writing, about a slave
      mother who tries to free her infant son by switching him with
      her master's baby, makes <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> MT's most
      sustained engagement with the institution of slavery. What
      it's saying about slavery, however, is by no means clear. As
      published, his story was illustrated in an unusual way, with
      hundreds of pen-and-ink "marginal illustrations" by F. M.
      Senior and C. H. Warren. Their images of slaves are as
      ambiguous as MT's text, ranging from sentimental to realistic
      to minstrel grotesque. The 18 examples of their work
      <i>below</i> are chosen to represent this range. The overall
      effect of using "marginal illustrations," though, is to keep
      the reader at a great distance from the narrative, to turn
      the characters into cartoons, and, since shading is
      impossible, to eliminate any kind of grey area between
      "black" and "white." (You can see all the illustrations in
      the <a href=
      "../../wilson/facsimile/facsimilehp.html"><font size=
      "-1">DIGITAL FACSIMILE</font></a> of the First edition in the
      PUDD'NHEAD WILSON section of the archive. When the novel
      appeared serially in <i>The Century</i>, it was illustrated
      by one of the magazine's staff artists, Louis Loeb, whose
      drawings, including 3 of slaves, can be seen on the <a href=
      "../../wilson/pwillshp.html"><font size="-1">ILLUSTRATING
      PUDD'NHEAD</font></a> page; there you can also see the 7 new
      illustrations that E. W. Kemble drew for a late 1890s edition
      -- slaves appear in 5 of those.)<br /></td>

      scene of Dawson's Landing. This representation of a
      slaveholding village recalls <i>Tom Sawyer</i>: boys and
      aunts are at the center, and slavery is only a peripheral
      element. But the text does include several mentions of the
      slaves on whose labor the "white village" depended, and among
      its 200 or so "marginal illustrations" are several graphic
      representations of slavery.<br />

      that word!" This protest rings out from one of the
      unfortunate characters in MT's <i>Prince and the Pauper</i>
      (1882). Hearing how harshly this man has been treated, the
      exiled Prince vows to abolish the law that made his
      enslavement possible, but as the man himself notes, he stands
      before MT's reader as specifically "An English <font size=
      "-1">SLAVE</font>!--that is he that stands before ye." No
      <i>American</i> slave ever voices a similar protest in MT's
      published books. "The most of King Arthur's British nation
      were slaves," writes Hank Morgan, the narrator of the novel
      that MT published between <i>Huck Finn</i> and <i>Pudd'nhead
      Wilson</i>. In <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> (1889) the past he
      depicts is the 6th century England he had read about in
      Malory and Scott, not the ante bellum South he grew up in.
      Slavery and anti-slavery play large roles in Hank's story. In
      Roxy's narrative in <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> New England
      "Yanks" are said to make the most heartless slave owners, but
      MT's Connecticut Yankee is a devout abolitionist whose
      critique of slavery in this text is much more outspoken than
      any of the narrators of MT's works depicting slavery in
      America. The novel's illustrations are much more graphic in
      depicting the horrors of slavery too. They are by Dan Beard,
      who was himself a politically engaged social critic. Beard's
      temperament, as well as Hank's direct attacks on slavery, may
      account for the anti-slavery force of the illustrations, but
      their representation of slavery may also reflect the fact
      that in <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> the slaves are all "white,"
      and the people who enslave them are <i>not</i>
      American.<br /></td>

      &#x00A0; How much easier it is to see something when there is
      no way for guilt, personal or collective, to get in the way
      may be what the drawings <i>below</i> also illustrate. They
      are by E. W. Kemble, the artist who illustrated every edition
      of <i>Huck Finn</i> published in MT's lifetime, and who
      became a specialist (as he puts it) in "negroes." Kemble's
      work appeared in several volumes in Joel Chander Harris'
      <i>Uncle Remus</i> series and in many magazines. He also
      collected them for books like <i>Kemble's Coons</i> (1897)
      and <i>Comical Coons</i> (1898). From 1885 through the first
      couple decades of the 20th century, white America loved his
      usually clownish and always stereotypical representations of
      blacks. The pictures he drew for an article titled "The
      Slave-Trade in the Congo Basin" (<i>Century Magazine</i>,
      February 1890), however, do not stereotype blacks or slaves.
      I think these pictures almost speak for themselves, not just
      about slavery but also about why it's so hard for American
      culture to get beyond caricatures and myths about slavery:
      now that Kemble is depicting slavery <i>somewhere else</i>,
      so that American whites need feel no responsibility for it,
      he draws slaves with human faces instead of blackface
      minstrel masks, and depicts their human suffering
      realistically. Compare these drawings to his work on <i>Huck
      Finn</i>, or the other Kemble illustrations further down this
      page, and see if you don't see the same thing
      yourself.<br /></td>

      <td>&#x00A0; This first sequence, though, starts in the 1840s,
      which is when <b>Blackface Minstrelsy</b> erupted onto the
      American cultural scene. The minstrel show, which claimed to
      represent African Americans and the lives of slaves on the
      plantation through the singing, dancing and comedy routines
      of white men "blacked up" with burnt cork, was the single
      most popular form of live entertainment in the U.S. until the
      late 19th century, when it began giving way to vaudeville.
      Most of the materials below are sheet music covers, but there
      is one example of the minstrel joke book too. Several of the
      artists featured were themselves African American, including
      the composer James Bland and the Johnson Brothers (one of
      whom was James Weldon Johnson, the writer), but the
      conventions governing the representation of "blacks" were
      defined by white publishers for white audiences.<br />
      &#x00A0; MT loved the minstrel show, and often borrowed from
      its conventions in his humorous pieces. More significantly,
      the caricatures and images of minstrelsy were the chief means
      by which many white Americans in MT's time "saw" slaves and
      freed blacks.</td>

      Their authors were white Southerners, although the tales were
      extremely popular throughout the North, and although they
      typically featured as story-tellers former slaves, who spoke
      in "black" dialect about life on "de old plantation." As a
      genre, the tales are drenched in nostalgia for that world.
      Even the slaves (as Joel Chandler Harris wrote in 1880 in his
      introduction to <i>Uncle Remus</i>) have "nothing but
      pleasant memories of the discipline of slavery." Sam, the
      "blackvoice" narrator inside Thomas Nelson Page's "Marse
      Chan" (1884), usually cited as the first full-blown
      plantation tale, goes even further, telling the white frame
      narrator that his life as a slave before Emancipation "wuz
      good ole times, marster--de bes' Sam ever see! Dey wuz, in
      fac'! Niggers didn' hed nothin' 't all to do--jes' hed to
      'ten' to de feedin' an' cleanin' de hosses, an' doin' what de
      marster tell 'em to do." White American readers bought this
      fiction again and again, and the images of masters and slaves
      that illustrated the plantation tales played a major role in
      shaping the way MT's times "saw" slavery.<br />
      &#x00A0; The incredible success of Harris' first book about
      Uncle Remus led to a series of sequels. The set of
      illustrations <i>below</i> are from two books he published in
      1892: <i>On the Plantation</i> and <i>Uncle Remus and His
      Friends</i>. The first group are by E. W. Kemble; the second,

      <td>&#x00A0; MT's times bought more tickets to Tom Shows than
      copies of his books, but his books were among the era's most
      popular and widely known representations of slavery. When
      they looked through the words and pictures in those books as
      windows onto the world of American slavery, what did his
      contemporaries see? Reviewers seldom discuss this theme
      directly, though you can search for a word like <b>slave</b>
      in the archive's <font size="-1"><b><a href=
      "../../about/search2.html" target="_new">SEARCH THE
      REVIEWS</a></b></font> to approach the question from that
      direction. In her <i>The Southern Magazine</i> review of the
      first two installments of <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, for
      instance, another Southern writer, the novelist Martha
      McCulloch Williams, says that MT's work was a caricature of
      the slave-<i>owners</i>: "To [MT's] mind, the only man worth
      either saving or damning in all the South country is the
      black man." On the other hand, in January 1889 MT actually
      substituted for Thomas Nelson Page at a benefit lecture in
      Baltimore, which suggests that to some in the audience both
      men shared, these two Southern-born and -raised writers whose
      best-known fictions depicted slavery, weren't ideologically
      incompatible.<br />
      <br />
      &#x00A0; No one reads Page anymore, but MT's works continue to
      be read inside and outside America's classrooms. What is the
      story they tell about slavery? That question, while it may
      never yield <i>an</i> answer everyone agrees on, should not
      be evaded or repressed.<br />
