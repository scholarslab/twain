        The relationship between Jim and Huck begins in Chapter 8,
        when they coincidentally meet after each has run away to
        Jackson's Island looking for freedom. To get away from Pap,
        Huck has staged his own murder, so when he appears before
        Jim, Jim thinks he's seeing a ghost: "He bounced up and
        stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees and puts
        his hands together and says: 'Doan' hurt me--don't! I
        hain't ever done no harm to a ghos.'"<br />
        How should we "read" this image of a superstitious black
        man on his knees, pleading with an armed white boy who
        stands over him? In three other places in the novel (all
        illustrated by Kemble), whites carry rifles to re-enslave
        runaways or to keep them from escaping. Huck, however, not
        only reassures Jim immediately that "I warn't dead," but
        when he learns that Jim has run away he promises not to
        tell on him. As part of his prayer to the "ghos'," Jim
        reminds Huck that he "'uz awluz yo' fren'," and Huck tells
        us that "I was ever so glad to see Jim." The nature of Jim
        and Huck's larger relationship is very complex. Most
        readers want to see the meeting on Jackson's Island as the
        beginning of a friendship, but as the visual starting point
        for their life together, this illustration draws a pretty
        blunt picture of the power dynamics between the
        races.<br />
