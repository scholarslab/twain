        illustrations on this page show the violent climax of
        Roxy's experience on a cotton plantation. When the overseer
        catches the little girl giving food to Roxy ("'ca'se she
        knowed de overseer did n't gimme enough to eat"), he hits
        her across the back "wid his stick, which 'uz as thick as a
        broom-handle." Seeing the girl "drop screamin' on de
        groun'," Roxy rebels: "All de hell-fire dat 'uz ever in my
        heart flame' up, en I snatch de stick outen his han' en
        laid him flat." As the other field hands, frightened by her
        act, gather around the overseer "to hep' him," Roxy jumps
        on his horse and takes out for the river, on which she
        escapes north to St. Louis again.<br />
        &#x00A0; Roxy fights here to defend a crippled child -- the
        sentimentality of the episode seems calculated to arouse
        the reader's sympathy with her, even her attack on a white
        person. But the novel's structure of ironies complicate its
        effect: as part of the scene in which she describes the
        horrors of slavery, for example, Roxy and Tom also plot to
        rob the white people of Dawson's Landing. In the very next
        chapter Tom "blacks up" and kills Judge Driscoll, which
        shifts the story's focus from the slave to the master as
        the victim. Unlike Chapter 2, where $2 were stolen, these
        "slaves" commit much more serious crimes, and (also unlike
        Chapter 2) no narrator steps in here to justify their acts
        in the context of the crime of slavery itself.<br />
