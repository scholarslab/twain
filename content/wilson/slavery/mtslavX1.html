  </center>MT's mainly mock-heroic account of his two weeks as a
  Confederate irregular appeared less than a year after <i>Huck
  Finn</i>, in the same magazine that had published excerpts of the
  novel, and with illustrations by E. W. Kemble, the artist MT
  hired to do the pictures for the novel. Slavery as an issue is
  treated comically at the start of the story: as states begin
  seceding, MT's loyalty to the Union is suspected "because my
  father had owned slaves," but a bit later the same friend
  suspects MT's new allegiance to the Confederacy because he had "a
  father who had been willing to set slaves free."<br />
  &#x00A0; One slave appears in the story: when Farmer Mason orders
  "one of his negroes" to show MT's inept band of rangers where to
  hide from a Yankee patrol. Presumably this is the slave Kemble
  means to represent in the drawing <i>above</i>, though "the
  negro" is not mentioned in the text's account of Mason making fun
  of these very irregular soldiers.<br />
