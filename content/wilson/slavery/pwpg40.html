        In this gallery of interracial representations I want to
        include two illustrations from the next novel MT wrote
        about the slave-owning society he grew up in: <i>Pudd'nhead
        Wilson</i>. Among the hundreds of "Marginal Illustrations"
        in that book are many that depict slaves kneeling. This
        one, by F. M. Senior, depicts the gratitude of three of
        Percy Driscoll's slaves after he decides not to sell them
        down the river for stealing. You can tell which one is
        Driscoll. The three kneeling are not named, simply
        enumerated as "a man, a woman, and a boy twelve years old."
        The woman standing behind the scene is Roxy, one of the
        novel's central characters. Despite her "white" appearance,
        she too is a slave. She does not kneel because she didn't
        take Driscoll's missing two dollars. It's interesting to
        speculate about how readers would have reacted to this
        familiar scene if among the abjectly kneeling figures had
        been a "white" woman.<br />
