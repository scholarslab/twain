        When Percy Driscoll dies, his will sets Roxy free, and she
        leaves Dawson's Landing to work as a chambermaid on a
        steamboat, planning never to return. But when rheumatism
        incapacitates her and her savings are lost by a bank
        failure, she "resolves to go to her birthplace," where her
        "friends among the negroes" will make sure she doesn't
        starve. In the illustrations here we see her "pilfer[ing]"
        food for herself, and telling her adventures on the river
        to the slaves in Judge Driscoll's kitchen, to whom she is
        "a heroine of romance." "The negroes hung enchanted upon
        the great story of her experiences, interrupting her all
        along with eager questions, with laughter, with
        exclamations of delight and expressions of applause; and
        she was obliged to confess to herself that if there was
        anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the
        glory to be got by telling about it."<br />
