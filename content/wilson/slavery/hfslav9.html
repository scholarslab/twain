        Huck describes the Phelps place where the novel's last
        episode is set as "one of these little one-horse cotton
        plantations" that "all look alike." 9 of the 40
        illustrations Kemble drew for this section depict slaves
        (if we include the 4 that depict or refer to Jim, who of
        course has been freed by Miss Watson at this point). Above
        is one of the novel's two illustrations of Nat, whom Huck
        describes as having "a good-natured chuckleheaded face,"
        and "wool [hair] . . . all tied up in little bunches with
        thread . . . to keep witches off." In this picture the food
        he carries is for Jim, who is being held in the shed while
        the Phelpses wait a reward from his supposed owners.<br />
