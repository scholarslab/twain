        This poster provides a visual menu of the typical "Tom
        Show's" cast and repetoire of effects. Stowe's emphasis on
        suffering slave mothers remains in the scene of Eliza
        crossing the ice, and the evil of slavery can be seen in
        the way Legree brandishes his whip, but slaves dance in
        from of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the doubled Topsys and
        Markses blur any meaningful distinction between slaves and
        slave hunters. American slavery has been made into a source
        of entertainment for white audiences.
