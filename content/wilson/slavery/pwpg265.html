        <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> makes it hard to decide not just
        how the novel as a whole depicts the realities of slavery,
        but even how an individual character like Roxy feels about
        her own experience <i>as</i> a slave. The moving account of
        her despair in Chapter 3, in which she goes from planning
        to kill herself and her child to escape slavery to deciding
        to switch her baby and her master's child instead, begins
        with her rage against the man who claims to own her: "I
        hates yo' pappy," she tells the white infant; "I hates him,
        en I could kill him!" But by the end of the story Roxy has
        become a zealous supporter of Judge Driscoll, the brother
        of the man she hated and the novel's other master. She has
        no nostalgia for slavery itself: the bill of sale that
        guarantees her freedom is "her most precious possession."
        But she goes to the book's climactic trial "hat[ing] these
        outlandish devils for killing" the Judge, and intending, as
        the illustration here depicts, to cheer their conviction:
        "When dat verdic' comes, I's gwine to lif' dat <i>roof</i>,
        now, I <i>tell</i> you."<br clear="left" />
        &#x00A0; The page's other illustration shows the District
        Attorney, in his opening speech, saying that the Judge's
        murder was "conceived by the blackest of hearts."<br />
