        how Rachel describes the auction at which she and her
        children were sold:<br />
        &#x00A0; "An' when I heah dat dey gwyne to sell us all off at
        oction in Richmon', oh de good gracious! I know what dat
        mean! . . . Dey put chains on us an' put us on a stan' . .
        . an' all de people stood aroun', crowds an' crowds. An'
        dey 'd come up dah an' look at us all roun', an' squeeze
        our arm, an' make us git up an' walk, an' den say, 'Dis one
        too ole,' or 'Dis one lame,' or 'Dis one don't 'mount to
        much.' An' dey sole my ole man, an' took him away, an' dey
        begin to sell my chil'en an' take <i>dem</i> away, an' I
        begin to cry; an' de man say, 'Shet up yo' dam blubberin','
        an' hit me on de mouf wid his han'. An' when de las' one
        was gone but my little Henry, I grab' <i>him</i> clost up
        to my breas' so, an' I ris up an' says, 'You shan't take
        him away,' I says; 'I'll kill de man dat fetches him!' I
        says. But my little Henry whisper an' say, 'I gwyne to run
        away, an' den I work an' buy yo' freedom.' Oh, bless de
        chile, he always so good! But dey got him -- dey got him,
        de men did; but I took and tear de clo'es mos' off of 'em,
        an' beat 'em over de head wid my chain; an' <i>dey</i> give
        it to <i>me</i>, too, but I didn't mine dat.<br />
        &#x00A0; "A True Story" was not illustrated when it first
        appeared in <i>The Atlantic</i>, but for its republication
        in <i>Sketches, New and Old</i> (1875) True Williams drew
        the above picture of "Aunt Rachel." The caption refers to
        catch phrase by which her son recognizes her 13 years after
        they'd been separated on the auction block.<br />
