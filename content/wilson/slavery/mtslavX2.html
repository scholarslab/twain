        <img src="mtslavX2.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" alt= "1908 MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /> Excerpts
        from MT's never-finished "autobiography" appeared serially
        in a newspaper supplement titled the <i>Sunday Magazine</i>
        between October, 1907, and September, 1908. These
        installments were illustrated from a variety of sources,
        including original art. There is no mention of a slave in
        the text this drawing accompanies, where MT explicitly says
        he "does not know" who rescued him each time providence
        tried to drown him.<br />
        &#x00A0; However, in the autobiography's account of his
        boyhood experiences at his Uncle Quarles' farm, which as he
        notes is the model for the Phelps' plantation in <i>Huck
        Finn</i>, MT discusses a few of the "fifteen or twenty
        negroes" his Uncle owned in some detail. Here is MT's most
        significant published comment on his own firsthand
        relationship to slavery:<br />
        <br clear="left" />
        &#x00A0; "It was a heavenly place for a boy, that farm of my
        Uncle John's. . . . All the negroes were friends of ours,
        and with those of our own age we were in effect comrades. I
        say in effect, using the phrase as a modification. We were
        comrades, and yet not comrades; color and condition
        interposed a subtle line which both parties were conscious
        of, and which rendered complete fusion impossible. We had a
        faithful and affectionate good friend, ally and adviser in
        'Uncle Dan'l,' a middle-aged slave whose head was the best
        one in the negro quarter, whose sympathies were wide and
        warm, and whose heart was honest and simple and knew no
        guile. He has served me well, these many, many years. I
        have not seen him for more than half a century, and yet
        spiritually I have had his welcome company a good part of
        that time, and have staged him in books under his own name
        and as 'Jim,' and carted him all around--to Hannibal, down
        the Mississippi on a raft, and even across the Desert of
        Sahara in a balloon--and he has endured it all with the
        patience and friendliness and loyalty which were his
        birthright. It was on the farm that I got my strong liking
        for his race and my appreciation of certain of its fine
        qualities. This feeling and this estimate have stood the
        test of sixty years and more and have suffered no
        impairment. The black face is as welcome to me now as it
        was then.<br />
        &#x00A0; "In my schoolboy days I had no aversion to slavery.
        I was not aware that there was anything wrong about it. No
        one arraigned it in my hearing; the local papers said
        nothing against it; the local pulpit taught us that God
        approved it, that it was a holy thing, and that the doubter
        need only look in the Bible if he wished to settle his
        mind--and then the texts were read aloud to us to make the
        matter sure; if the slaves themselves had an aversion to
        slavery they were wise and said nothing. In Hannibal we
        seldom saw a slave misused; on the farm, never.<br />
        &#x00A0; "There was, however, one small incident of my
        boyhood days which touched this matter, and it must have
        meant a good deal to me or it would not have stayed in my
        memory, clear and sharp, vivid and shadowless, all these
        slow-drifting years. We had a little slave boy whom we had
        hired from some one, there in Hannibal. He was from the
        Eastern Shore of Maryland, and had been brought away from
        his family and his friends, half-way across the American
        continent, and sold. He was a cheery spirit, innocent and
        gentle, and the noisiest creature that ever was, perhaps.
        All day long he was singing, whistling, yelling, whooping,
        laughing--it was maddening, devastating, unendurable. At
        last, one day, I lost all my temper and went raging to my
        mother, and said Sandy had been singing for an hour without
        a single break, and I couldn't stand it, and
        <i>wouldn't</i> she please shut him up. The tears came into
        her eyes, and her lip trembled, and she said something like
        this--<br />
        &#x00A0; "'Poor thing, when he sings, it shows that he is not
        remembering, and that comforts me; but when he is still, I
        am afraid he is thinking, and I cannot bear it. He will
        never see his mother again; if he can sing, I must not
        hinder it, but be thankful for it. If you were older, you
        would understand me; then that friendless child's noise
        would make you glad.'<br />
        &#x00A0; "It was a simple speech, and made up of small words,
        but it went home, and Sandy's noise was not a trouble to me
        any more. . . ."<br />
