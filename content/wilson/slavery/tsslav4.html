        Among the diversions that briefly make the village's boys
        happy after summer begins are a mesmerist, a phrenologist,
        a circus, the Fourth of July, and the "first of all the
        negro minstrel shows [that] came to town, and made a
        sensation." From this list of possible subjects, Williams
        chose to illustrate the scene of Tom, Joe Harper and other
        [white] boys, blacked up and putting on their own
        show.<br />
        The earliest minstrel shows of this kind appeared in
        northern cities in the early 1840s, and soon spread to the
        rest of the nation. MT loved minstrelsy, and often borrowed
        from its routines for his comedy. Blackface minstrelsy
        claimed to represent blacks and their experience in slavery
        accurately, though the shows almost always represented
        slaves as "happy darkies" -- except when they were "still
        longing for the old plantation" after running away to the
        north.<br />
