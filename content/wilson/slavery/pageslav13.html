        "Polly," the last tale in the volume, finds comic relief in
        the relationship between "the Colonel" and his slave Tom,
        whom every calls "Drinkwater Torm," because, the Colonel
        said, "if he were to drink water once he would die." "Torm"
        drinks the Colonel's whisky, and is often drunk -- as in
        this opening scene. That's Tom in the foreground, sprawled
        on the parlor floor. On the Colonel's lap sits Polly, his
        niece, the only person who believes the Colonel's
        oft-repeated threats to sell Torm.<br />
        The larger story focuses on the Colonel's refusal to allow
        Polly to marry Bob, and the distance this puts between the
        old man and the growing young lady. "Torm" remains fiercely
        loyal to both his "ole marster" and his "young
        mistis."<br />
