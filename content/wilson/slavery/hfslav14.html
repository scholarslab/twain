        This is the only illustration of Jim in the shed. It
        illustrates the comedy of Tom's attempt to stage a romantic
        escape with the material at hand. That material includes
        "mullen," though Tom says Jim must call it "Pitchiola,"
        adding that like the "other prisoners" he has read about in
        European romances, Jim must water it with his tears. Jim
        reluctantly agrees, though he tells Tom springwater would
        be better, and he adds the potentially chilling detail that
        "I doan' skasely ever cry." Between them, what the text and
        this drawing seem to do is to make the suffering of a slave
        purely comic; it may be hard for modern readers to laugh at
        the tears Jim sheds and Kemble draws, but it is impossible
        to take them seriously.<br />
