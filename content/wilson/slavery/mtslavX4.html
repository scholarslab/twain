      the New York <i>World</i> asked MT to write about his first
      lie, they probably expected a humorous anecdote. What MT gave
      them, however, is more typical of his late, pessimistic
      philosophical writings than his early, exhuberant tall tales.
      "All people are liars," he wrote, and offered as proof "the
      lie of silent assertion" --<br />
      &#x00A0; "For instance. It would not be possible for a humane
      and intelligent person to invent a rational excuse for
      slavery; yet you will remember that in the early days of the
      emancipation agitation in the North the agitators got but
      small help or countenance from any one. Argue and plead and
      pray as they might, they could not break the universal
      stillness that reigned, from pulpit and press all the way
      down to the bottom of society--the clammy stillness created
      and maintained by the lie of silent assertion--the silent
      assertion that there wasn't anything going on in which humane
      and intelligent people were interested."<br /></td>
