        The Evasion Tom is staging is modeled on the imprisonment
        and escape of noble prisoners in romances like <i>The Count
        of Monte Cristo</i>, so he insists on making Jim a coat of
        arms. The "chain embattled" is included, he says, to
        represent "slavery." Note how the "crest" imitates the
        stereotypical image on a fugitive slave wanted poster like
        the one the Duke prints up.<br />
        When Jim is disguised as a "sick Arab" in Chapter 24, the
        Duke dresses him up in "King Lear's outfit." Kingly clothes
        and a coat of arms -- these sound as if they could be meant
        to evoke the idea of Jim's innate human nobility, but in
        Kemble's drawings both make his figure even more
        clownish.<br />
