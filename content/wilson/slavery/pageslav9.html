        "Ole 'Stracted," set after the Civil War, is about an old
        black man whose "Marster" was forced to sell him forty
        years earlier, when he was still a slave. He has forgotten
        his own name, but not the promise "Marster" made to buy him
        back. The drawings are by A. B. Frost. In this one we see
        him still patiently waiting.<br />
