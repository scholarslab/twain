	"S-t-e-a-m-boat a-comin'!" -- that's the first line of
        dialogue we hear in "Old Times," and it's boomed out by a
        slave, though the narrative doesn't use that word in its
        description of this "negro drayman, famous for his quick
        eye and prodigious voice." Presumably that's this drayman
        in the illustration. This is the text's only reference to
        blacks on the scene of the "white town drowsing in the
        sunshine of a summer morning" with which "Old Times"
        begins. As the boat approaches, we hear about "the crew
        grouped on the forecastle," but with no indication that
        they were black.<br />
