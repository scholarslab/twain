        interesting theme in <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> is that
        slaves' behavior is a kind of pose. The first time we meet
        Roxy, for example, we learn not only that she looks as
        "white" as any of the white citizens of Dawson's Landing,
        but also that she has "an independent carriage" among her
        own "caste," although "of course she was meek and humble
        where white people were." Similarly when she asks Tom for
        help after losing her savings, she "approache[s] her son
        with all the wheedling and supplicating servilities that
        fear and interest can impart to the words and attitudes of
        the born slave." That this is an <i>act</i>, a pose rather
        than an essential consequence of slavery, becomes clear
        when Tom scorns her request. The picture here illustrates
        this text:<br clear="left" />
        &#x00A0; "Roxy's head was down, in an attitude of humility.
        But now the fires of her old wrongs flamed up in her breast
        and began to burn fiercely. She raised her head slowly,
        till it was well up, and at the same time her great frame
        unconsciously assumed an erect and masterful attitude, with
        all the majesty and grace of her vanished youth in
        it."<br />
