        The anti-slavery force of this scene is a remarkable
        combination of the sentimental and the surreal. When the
        gang of slaves is caught unsheltered in a snowstorm, the
        driver arranges to save some of them at least from
        perishing in the cold by helping a lynch mob burn a woman
        who has been accused of practicing witchcraft. "They
        fastened her to a post; they brought wood and piled it
        about her; they applied the torch while she shrieked and
        pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast;
        and our brute, with a heart solely for business, lashed us
        into position and warmed us into life and commercial value
        by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that
        poor harmless mother. That was the sort of master we
        had."<br />
