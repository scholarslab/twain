        This is one of the illustrations that C. S. Reinhart drew
        in 1893 for a giftbook publication of "Meh Lady." Its
        narrator is simply referred to as "uncle," and he always
        refers to its heroine as "Meh Lady." The story "uncle"
        tells covers a period that begins "in ole Virginia" and
        ends in the post-Emancipation South. After the War southern
        ladies have to struggle against new enemies, especially
        poverty, but just as they maintain their nobility, the
        relationships between them and their former slaves remain
        unchanged too. As a "freedman," the tale's narrator finds
        his deepest fulfillments in serving his "Lady" and telling
        the story of her heroism. He has no other story he wants to
        tell.<br />
