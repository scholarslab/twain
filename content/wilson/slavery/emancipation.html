        This lithograph is by Currier &amp; Ives. It was designed
        and put on sale in 1863, to celebrate Lincoln's signing of
        the Emancipation Proclamation. Many of the memorials to
        that act, in drawings and paintings and statuary, configure
        the moment exactly this way: a grateful slave kneels to a
        standing, indeed a towering President.<br />
