        Hank notes that King Arthur's body could be chained and
        beaten, but his spirit could not be broken. Despite all his
        violent attempts to tame Arthur, "even that dull clod of a
        slave-driver" is eventually forced to realize "that there
        can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man till
        he dies." This is a stirring tribute to an innate humanity,
        but it has to be noted that no MT narrator ever says the
        same thing about any black slave in the U.S, and none of
        the illustrations of American slaves in MT's books ever
        show a slave standing this tall and proud despite his
        enslavement. The closest we get to that is the scene at the
        end of Chapter 15 in <i>Huck Finn</i>, where Jim eloquently
        asserts his human dignity by rebuking Huck for "mak[ing] a
        fool uv ole Jim wid a lie." It's interesting that <i>no</i>
        American illustrated edition has ever chosen to include a
        picture of that scene.<br clear="left" />
