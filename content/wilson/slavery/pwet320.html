        MT's farce properly begins in the middle of a stormy night
        when two "extraordinary" men arrive at Aunt Patsy Cooper's
        house as boarders. They are Count Luigi and Count Angelo,
        whom no one in Dawson's Landing has seen. It may be
        irrelevant that the scene of their arrival actually begins
        with another pair of men, but the illustration here depicts
        this passage in MT's text: "At last there was a knock at
        the door and the anxious family jumped to open it. Two
        negro men entered, each carrying a trunk, and proceeded
        up-stairs toward the guest-room." These are the first "men"
        introduced into in the narrative or depicted in the
        illustrations. That <i>they</i> could not possibly be the
        boarders, even though they carry trunks and head for the
        guest room, is an assumption readers may share with the
        Coopers only because of the racist patterns that govern the
        world MT is writing about.<br />
