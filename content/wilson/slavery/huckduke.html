        On the one hand this is the familiar iconography: standing
        white, kneeling black. Many of the illustrations of Jim
        depict him visually beneath the novel's white characters.
        But this image is also a reminder of how complex such
        conventional (and intrinsically racist) representations can
        become in MT's novel. The "Duke's" speech also echoes the
        Anti-Slavery emblem -- "am I not a man and a duke?" But the
        "rights" the white man is claiming so grandly here are
        clearly fraudulent.<br />
