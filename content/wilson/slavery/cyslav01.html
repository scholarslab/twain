        Traveling through Arthurian England with Sandy, Hank
        encounters a gang of chained slaves being driven toward
        markets, and describes them in a long passage that
        emphasizes (1) their great physical and emotional suffering
        ("not a face among all these half hundred people but . . .
        bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of
        long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair"),
        (2) the viciousness of the "trader in charge" and the
        callousness with which others watch him strip and lash a
        young woman slave "till her back was flayed, she shrieking
        and struggling the while," and (3) the anguish of a family
        being "torn apart by force," a picture that "wrings
        [Hank's] heartstrings whenever I think of it."<br />
        &#x00A0; There is no more explicit dramatization of the
        horror of slavery in all MT's published work. The
        description of the slaves' faces draws on a memory from Sam
        Clemens' childhood in Hannibal. MT took other details in
        the passage from a slave narrative by Charles Ball, titled
        <i>Slavery in the United States</i> (1837), as you can see
        for yourself in the <font size="-1">CONNECTICUT YANKEE
        SOURCES</font> section of the archive. Nothing in the
        passage, however, directs readers of <i>Connecticut
        Yankee</i> to associate this terrific scene with
        <i>American</i> history.<br />
