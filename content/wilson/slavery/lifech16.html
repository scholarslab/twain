        It is not until July, when the seventh and last installment
        of "Old Times" appeared, that <i>Atlantic</i> readers found
        out directly from the narrator that the "entire crew" of a
        steamer, "firemen and deck-hands," were "(usually swarthy
        negroes)." As part of MT's stirring account of an old-time
        steamboat race leaving from the levee in New Orleans, he
        describes "the half-naked crews of perspiring negroes"
        loading "freight into the hold," and the "mighty chorus" of
        black voices that cheers the start of the race. This race
        is the only kind of race that matters in MT's first text
        about the ante bellum South.<br />
