        This image can be read in a number of ways. It too
        resembles scenes contemporary readers would have been
        familiar with from Minstrel and Tom Shows, which typically
        depicted slaves "singin' and dancin'" on "de old
        plantation." But in the margins of MT's text it can be seen
        as a bitterly ironic comment on the unreality of such
        scenes. Tom has sold his mother to an "Arkansas cotton
        planter" -- in other words, down the river. But he pretends
        he's sold her to an "upcountry farm," and in Roxy's
        presence, we're told, the conversation "was all about . . .
        how pleasant a place it was, and how happy the slaves were
        there." That's specifically what this picture illustrates:
        the lie about how happy the slaves were on this mythical
        plantation.<br />
