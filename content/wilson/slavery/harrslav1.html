        The subtitle of Harris' book is <i>A Georgia Boy's
        Adventures during the War</i>. It is a fictionalized
        version of Harris' own experiences, featuring his
        relationships with the slaves who took especial care of the
        "boy" after he befriended a runaway slave who hid for years
        in the neighborhood, refusing to go back to his plantation
        because, as he tells Joe, "Dey don't treat me right, suh."
        His name is Mink.<br />
