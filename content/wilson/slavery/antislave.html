        This is the most famous abolitionist image. It was
        originally created by Thomas Wedgewood for England's
        Anti-Slavery Society; in the 1830s the American
        Anti-Slavery Society adopted it as the emblem of their
        cause. The Editors of the definitive University of
        California edition of <i>Huck Finn</i> suggest that
        Kemble's drawing of Jim on his knees to Huck "quotes
        unmistakably" from this image, "one of the most widely
        known graphic symbols of the campaign to abolish slavery."
        Soon after meeting Jim on Jackson's Island, Huck does
        promise to help him run away from slavery, but in the
        drawing we don't just see Jim kneeling in supplicant -- we
        also see a white person standing over him with a gun, which
        at least complicates that Anti-Slavery image.<br />
