        My reason for including this illustration requires a bit of
        explanation. As part of their scam at the Wilkses', the
        King and the Duke sell off Peter Wilks' property. Included
        in the estate are 3 slaves: a mother and two sons. In
        Chapter 27 we learn that the King has sold them to "a
        couple of nigger traders . . . the two sons up the river to
        Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans." It is
        a scene that recalls Rachel's narrative in MT's "True
        Story," though it substitutes sentiment for Rachel's
        violent resistance: "I thought them poor [white Wilks']
        girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief;
        they cried around each other, and took on so it most made
        me sick to see it." In <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, Stowe
        would have bitterly called this scene "a select incident of
        a lawful trade," one of the typical effects of slavery.
        Huck simply describes it, but with considerable emotional
        and moral force. He never, however, gives these slaves
        names. For his part, Kemble chose not to illustrate it, and
        instead, a chapter later, drew the scene <i>above</i>, the
        auction at which all the non-human assets of the late Peter
        Wilks are sold. As an auction scene that replaces the scene
        of selling that black family apart, this strikes me as
        relevant to the question of how <i>Huck Finn</i> depicted
        slavery for its original readers. The novel's illustrations
        never show us any of the slaves at either the Grangerfords'
        or the Wilks'.<br />
