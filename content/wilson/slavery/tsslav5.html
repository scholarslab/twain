        We don't meet Jake as a character, but Huck mentions him to
        Tom as someone who'll give him food and a place to sleep
        while he keeps watch for Injun Joe's treasure. "That's a
        mighty good nigger, Tom," Huck says. "He likes me, becuz I
        don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometimes I've set
        right down and eat <i>with</i> him. But you needn't tell
        that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he
        wouldn't want to do as a steady thing."<br />
        Though he enjoys playing with Huck <i>because</i> he's been
        forbidden to, Tom in turn "did not care to have Huck's
        company in public places." In these passages the novel
        reminds us of how stratified by class and race was the
        "sleepy little village of St. Petersburg." It's interesting
        that the narrative here connects Huck with an adult slave
        -- almost as soon as MT finished <i>Tom Sawyer</i> he began
        writing <i>Huck Finn</i>, and by Chapter 8 of that novel
        Huck and Jim (a different Jim than the boy in <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i>) have their first meal together.<br />
