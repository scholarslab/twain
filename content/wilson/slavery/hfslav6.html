        This is the house that Col. Grangerford and his family live
        in, "a double house, and the big open place betwixt them
        was roofed and floored." Although it doesn't conform to the
        conventional idea of an ante bellum plantation, we're told
        that Grangerford owns "over a hundred" slaves, and that
        each member of the family "had their own nigger to wait on
        them." According to Huck, Buck Grangerford keeps his slave
        "on the jump most of the time." While at this plantation,
        Huck is given his own slave too, and is even called "Mars"
        one time. We learn from Jim later that his name is Jack,
        and Huck agrees with Jim that he's "pooty smart." While
        Huck is inside the house, Jim gets a lot of help hiding out
        and refitting the raft from the community of Grangerford
        slaves, as we hear from Jim himself in Chapter 18; Kemble,
        however, did not chose to illustrate any of this.<br />
