        &#x00A0; While traveling incognito through the country, Hank
        and King Arthur are sold into slavery, and chained onto the
        same gang Hank had first seen in Chapter 21 -- you see them
        here, at the end of coffle. The chapters recounting their
        experiences result in the novel's most sustained engagement
        with slavery, and at one point, at least, Hank's narrative
        overtly connects their sufferings to American
        circumstances: he points out that the law that allows him
        to be enslaved is the "same infernal law [that] had existed
        in our own South in my own time," which required freed
        blacks to prove they were <i>not</i> slaves.<br />
        &#x00A0; Hank also thinks of American slavery earlier in the
        journey he makes with the king, when he sees how willing
        the peasants are to serve the lord of the manor against
        their own class and interests. It reminds him of the "'poor
        whites' of our South," who fought for the "slave lords" in
        the Civil War, dying to preserve slavery despite the way
        slavery was "the very institution that degraded them" as
        well as the slaves.<br />
