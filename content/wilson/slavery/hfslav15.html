        After Tom's wound results in Jim's recapture, Huck's text
        tells us that "some [of the men] wanted to hang Jim, for an
        example to all the other niggers around there, so they
        wouldn't be trying to run away, like Jim done," but they
        decide not to when reminded that Jim's owner might show up
        "and make us pay for him." It's startling to think how
        different the novel would be if it had ended with Jim's
        lynching.<br />
        The whites do curse Jim "considerable," and "give him a
        cuff or two," and Jim never speaks in his own defense. But
        the doctor who had tended Tom on the raft does Jim a "good
        turn," as Huck puts it, when he testifies to the way Jim
        gave up his freedom to help nurse the wounded white boy. In
        this picture Jim still has on the dress Tom had told him he
        had to wear as part of the Evasion.<br />
