        "Over in the vacant lots was Jasper, young, coal-black and
        of magnificent build, sitting on a wheelbarrow in the
        pelting sun--at work, supposedly, whereas he was in fact
        only preparing for it by taking an hour's rest. In front of
        Wilson's porch stood Roxy," also a slave at work, though
        since fifteen of Roxy's great-great-grandparents were
        "white," her "blackness" does not show. In this passage the
        narrator describes her and her child's status as "negro"
        and "slave" as "a fiction of law and custom."<br />
