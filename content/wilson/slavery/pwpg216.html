        Although the idea, and the fact, of being sold "<font size=
        "-1">DOWN THE RIVER</font>" drives the novel's narrative,
        this is its only illustration of a slave auction, and it
        illustrates a hypothetical one. Roxy is offering to let her
        son sell her in order to raise money to pay his gambling
        debts, even though (as he reminds her) she is free. "Much
        diff'rence dat make!" she replies; "White folks ain't
        partic'lar. De law kin sell me now if dey tell me to leave
        the State in six months and I don't go."<br />
        (I wonder if contemporary readers would have recognized the
        black man with Roxy here as "Uncle Tom," who was invariably
        played as an old man in the "Tom Shows" that were still
        extremely popular when the novel appeared.)<br />
