        Here is another of the scenes in which MT and his
        illustrators use Nancy's reactions for comic effect: "The
        first time the negro girl Nancy appeared in the door and
        saw the two heads turned in opposite directions and both
        talking at once, then saw the commingling arms feed
        potatoes into one mouth and coffee into the other at the
        same time, she had to pause and pull herself out of a
        faintness that came over her; but after that she held her
        grip and was able to wait on the table with fair courage."
        It's worth noting that the text need not specify that "the
        door" leads to the kitchen. Where else would Nancy's place
        be?<br />
