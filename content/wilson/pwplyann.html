        <p>At the Herald Square Theatre on Tuesday evening a
        dramatic version of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" will
        be produced for the first time in the city. The
        dramatization is the work of Frank Mayo, who will appear in
        the title role. The story of the book has been followed
        very closely in the play, but as the novel lacks a love
        story, without which no drama is complete, Mr. Mayo has
        supplied this deficiency by introducing a sentimental
        element. The play, which is described as melodrama, is in
        four acts and a prologue, and Manager Evans has staged it
        in an elaborate manner. The cast will include besides Mr.
        Mayo, E.J. Henley, Edgar A. Davenport, Harry Davenport,
        Joseph Whiting, Ignacio Martinetti, Adolph Klauber, Odell
        Williams, John E. Ince, Herbert Milward, William Gill, Mary
        Shaw, Frances Graham, Lucille La Verne, and Emma
        Brennan.</p>
