        <p>Mayo's production was in Boston during Thanksgiving
        week, 1895. It was announced on Sunday, November 23, in
        brief notices that focused on the story of Pudd'nhead
        himself:</p>

        <p>Henry A. Clapp reviewed the play for the <i>Daily
        Advertiser</i> (which managed to refer to Mayo as "Mrs.
        Frank Mayo" in its headline). He locates the story in the
        context of slavery and the old South, and is the only
        critic I've found who is uncomfortable with Mayo's comic
        interpretation of Pudd'nhead:</p>

          ADVERTISER</i> REVIEW</a></b></font>
        </center><br />
        <br />

        <p>The <i>Globe</i> review was unsigned. The critic
        expressed the usual misgivings about dramatizing a novel,
        but is generally favorable. The review includes a few plot
        details not mentioned elsewhere, and treats the play as a
        melodrama which is "for the most part a comedy":</p>

          <font size="-1"><b><a href="pwbost4.html"><i>GLOBE</i>
          REVIEW</a></b></font>
        </center><br />
        <br />

        <p>After their week in Boston Mayo and company moved on to
        another stage, but the January, 1896, issue of <i>The
        Bostonian</i> magazine included a review by Atherton
        Brownell. As the lead article in his "Rambles in Stageland"
        department, he discussed the play in the context of
        national drama. I've omitted about a third of the article,
        as it doesn't deal at all with <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>.
        Unlike most critics, Brownell was unhappy with Eleanor
        Moretti's interpretation of Roxy; while others seem to have
        enjoyed her use of broadly, probably stereotypically
        African American mannerisms and dialect, he apparently felt
        such behavior was inappropriate in someone who looked so
        "white":</p>
