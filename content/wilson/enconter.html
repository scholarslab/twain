                  [<i>"Sam Clemens interviews Mark Twain" was an idea for a
          sketch that MT proposed in his journal near the end of
          his career. He never wrote that. But for a volume
          titled</i> Lotos Leaves <i>, edited by John Brougham and
          John Elderkin and issued in November, 1874, he did write
          this somewhat surreal sketch, about his own
          (non-existent) twin brother. This is his earliest
          rehearsal of the trope of changelings that he employs in
          both</i> The Prince and the Pauper <i>and</i> Pudd'nhead
          Wilson<i>. Later MT used versions of this "encounter" as
          part of his live performances.</i>]

          <h2>An Encounter with an Interviewer</h2>
        </center>The nervous, dapper, "peart" young man took the
        chair I offered him, and said he was connected with the
        <i>Daily Thunderstorm</i>, and added,--

        <p>"Hoping it's no harm, I've come to interview you."</p>

        <p>"Come to what?"</p>

        <p>"<i>Interview</i> you."</p>

        <p>"Ah! I see. Yes,--yes. Um! Yes,--yes."</p>

        <p>I was not feeling bright that morning. Indeed, my powers
        seemed a bit under a cloud. However, I went to the
        bookcase, and when I had been looking six or seven minutes,
        I found I was obliged to refer to the young man. I
        said,--</p>

        <p>"How do you spell it?"</p>

        <p>"Spell what?"</p>

        <p>"Interview."</p>

        <p>"O my goodness! What do you want to spell it for?"</p>

        <p>"I don't want to spell it; I want to see what it
        means."</p>

        <p>"Well, this is astonishing, I must say. <i>I</i> can
        tell you what it means, if you--if you--"</p>

        <p>"O, all right! That will answer, and much obliged to
        you, too."</p>

        <p>"I n, <i>in</i>, t e r, <i>ter</i>, <i>in</i>ter--"</p>

        <p>"Then you spell it with an <i>I</i>?"</p>

        <p>"Why, certainly!"</p>

        <p>"O, that is what took me so long."</p>

        <p>"Why, my <i>dear</i> sir, what did <i>you</i> propose to
        spell it with?"</p>

        <p>"Well, I--I--I hardly know. I had the Unabridged, and I
        was ciphering around in the back end, hoping I might tree
        her among the pictures. But it's a very old edition."</p>

        <p>"Why, my friend, they wouldn't have a <i>picture</i> of
        it in even the latest e-- My dear sir, I beg your pardon, I
        mean no harm in the world, but you do not look
        as--as--intelligent as I had expected you would. No
        harm,--I mean no harm at all."</p>

        <p>"O, don't mention it! It has often been said, and by
        people who would not flatter and who could have no
        inducement to flatter, that I am quite remarkable in that
        way. Yes,--yes; they always speak of it with rapture."</p>

        <p>"I can easily imagine it. But about this interview. You
        know it is the custom, now, to interview any man who has
        become notorious."</p>

        <p>"Indeed! I had not heard of it before. It must be very
        interesting. What do you do it with?"</p>

        <p>"Ah, well,--well,--well,--this is disheartening. It
        <i>ought</i> to be done with a club in some cases; but
        customarily it consists in the interviewer asking questions
        and the interviewed answering them. It is all the rage now.
        Will you let me ask you certain questions calculated to
        bring out the salient points of your public and private
        history?"</p>

        <p>"O, with pleasure,--with pleasure. I have a very bad
        memory, but I hope you will not mind that. That is to say,
        it is an irregular memory,--singularly irregular. Sometimes
        it goes in a gallop, and then again it will be as much as a
        fortnight passing a given point. This is a great grief to
        me."</p>

        <p>"O, it is no matter, so you will try to do the best you
        can."</p>

        <p>"I will. I will put my whole mind on it."</p>

        <p>"Thanks. Are you ready to begin?"</p>

        <p>"Ready."</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> How old are you?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Nineteen, in June.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Indeed! I would have taken you to be
        thirty-five or six. Where were you born?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> In Missouri.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> When did you begin to write?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> In 1836.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Why, how could that be, if you are only
        nineteen now?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> I don't know. It does seem curious
        somehow.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> It does, indeed. Who do you consider the most
        remarkable man you ever met?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Aaron Burr.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> But you never could have met Aaron Burr, if
        you are only nineteen years--</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Now, if you know more about me than I do, what
        do you ask me for?</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Well, it was only a suggestion; nothing more.
        How did you happen to meet Burr?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Well, I happened to be at his funeral one day,
        and he asked me to make less noise, and--</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> But, good heavens! If you were at his funeral,
        he must have been dead; and if he was dead, how could he
        care whether you made a noise or not?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> I don't know. He was always a particular kind
        of a man that way.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Still, I don't understand it at all. You say
        he spoke to you and that he was dead.</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> I didn't say he was dead.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> But wasn't he dead?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Well, some said he was, some said he
        wasn't.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> What do you think?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> O, it was none of my business! It wasn't any
        of my funeral.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Did you-- However, we can never get this
        matter straight. Let me ask about something else. What was
        the date of your birth?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Monday, October 31, 1693.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> What! Impossible! That would make you a
        hundred and eighty years old. How do you account for
        that?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> I don't account for it at all.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> But you said at first you were only nineteen,
        and now you make yourself out to be one hundred and eighty.
        It is an awful discrepancy.</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Why, have you noticed that? (<i>Shaking
        hands</i>.) Many a time it has seemed to me like a
        discrepancy, but somehow I couldn't make up my mind. How
        quick you notice a thing!</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Thank you for the compliment, as far as it
        goes. Had you, or have you, any brothers or sisters?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Eh! I--I--I think so,--yes,--but I don't
        remember.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Well, that is the most extraordinary statement
        I ever heard!</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Why, what makes you think that?</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> How could I think otherwise? Why, look here!
        who is this a picture of on the wall? Isn't that a brother
        of yours?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Oh! yes, yes, yes! Now you remind me of it,
        that <i>was</i> a brother of mine. That's
        William,--<i>Bill</i> we called him. Poor old Bill!</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Why? Is he dead, then?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Ah, well, I suppose so. We never could tell.
        There was a great mystery about it.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> That is sad, very sad. He disappeared,
        then?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Well, yes, in a sort of general way. We buried
        him.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> <i>Buried</i> him! <i>Buried</i> him without
        knowing whether he was dead or not?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> O no! Not that. He was dead enough.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Well, I confess that I can't understand this.
        If you buried him and you knew he was dead--</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> No! no! we only thought he was.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> O, I see! He came to life again?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> I bet he didn't.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Well, I never heard anything like this.
        <i>Somebody</i> was dead. <i>Somebody</i> was buried. Now,
        where was the mystery?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Ah, that's just it! That's it exactly. You see
        we were twins,--defunct and I,--and we got mixed in the
        bath-tub when we were only two weeks old, and one of us was
        drowned. But we didn't know which. Some think it was Bill,
        some think it was me.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Well, that <i>is</i> remarkable. What do
        <i>you</i> think?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> Goodness knows! I would give whole worlds to
        know. This solemn, this awful mystery has cast a gloom over
        my whole life. But I will tell you a secret now, which I
        never have revealed to any creature before. One of us had a
        peculiar mark, a large mole on the back of the left
        hand,--that was <i>me. That child was the one that was
        drowned.</i></p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Very well, then, I don't see that there is any
        mystery about it, after all.</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> You don't? Well, <i>I</i> do. Anyway I don't
        see how they could ever have been such a blundering lot as
        to go and bury the wrong child. But, 'sh!--don't mention it
        where the family can hear of it. Heaven knows they have
        heart-breaking troubles enough without adding this.</p>

        <p><b>Q.</b> Well, I believe I have got material enough for
        the present, and I am very much obliged to you for the
        pains you have taken. But I was a good deal interested in
        that account of Aaron Burr's funeral. Would you mind
        telling me what particular circumstance it was that made
        you think Burr was such a remarkable man?</p>

        <p><b>A.</b> O, it was a mere trifle! Not one man in fifty
        would have noticed it at all. When the sermon was over, and
        the procession all ready to start for the cemetery, and the
        body all arranged nice in the hearse, he said he wanted to
        take a last look at the scenery, and so he <i>got up and
        rode with the driver</i>.</p>

        <p>Then the young man reverently withdrew. He was very
        pleasant company, and I was sorry to see him go.</p>
