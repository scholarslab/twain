          <h2>Performing <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i></h2>
        </center><img src="pwplanot.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" alt= "NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT" />

        <p>Less than a year after its publication, <i>The Tragedy
        of Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> was dramatized as a melodramatic
        comedy in a prologue and four acts. The play was the work
        of Frank Mayo, an American actor best known for his
        portrayal of Davy Crockett.  Mayo's script is available <i>below</i>.</p>

        <p>Rehearsals began 19 March 1895. It opened out of town in
        Hartford, on April 8th, and had its New York premiere at the Herald Square Theatre on Monday, April
        15th. As you can see for yourself <i>below</i>, reviews were favorable but not enthusiastic. The
        critics regularly mentioned the problems of translating a
        work of fiction to the stage, though not all of them seem
        to have read the novel. Mayo's work in the title role and
        the dramatic force of the final, courtroom act were cited
        as the play's most taking points. MT attended a performance
        on 22 May 1895, and in <a href="mtonmayo2.html">his remarks
        afterward</a> expressed complete satisfaction with Mayo's
        handling of the story.</p><a href=
        "javascript:Start('pwphoto1.jpg')"><img src="pwphoto1.gif"
        align="right" hspace="5" alt= "CAST PHOTO" /></a>

        <p>The production was booked into New York for a six-week
        run, and then seems to have gone straight on the road. Mayo
        died while touring with the play, on route to Omaha for
        what would (according to his obituary in the <i>Times</i>
        on 9 June 1896) have been his 368th performance as
        Pudd'nhead. According to letters in the Barrett Collection
        from H.H. Rogers to MT, by March, 1896, the production was
        "at last" on its feet, and beginning to pay royalties; for
        that month it paid MT over $1400. Legal complications involving
Mayo's estate and his partner took some months to settle.
        Not long after the 1896-1897 theatrical season began, however, the show did go
        on, with a new actor as Pudd'nhead and much of the same
        company behind him.  The <a href="pwplay/pwplaysched.html">Schedule
of Performances</a> link <i>below</i> will let you follow the play during the first four years of its national run.  Writing in 1912, Paine added that the play "is by no
        means dead, and still pays a royalty to the Mayo and
        Clemens estates."</p>

        <p>The play's success can be read in more than one way.  Like the novel, Mayo's script climaxes with the
        trial at which the fingerprints prove that "Tom" is not
        just the criminal, but also a "negro and slave." Courtroom
        scenes tend to make for good drama, but it seems possible that
        this trial also served American audiences as a kind of
        ritual. The reviews you can read from around the country clearly suggest that "Tom" was portrayed as a
        villain in more melodramatic terms than the novel uses. In
        one promotional announcement, for example, he
        is referred to as "devilish and diabolical." Perhaps the
        play's appeal was derived in part from the idea of
        labeling, condemning and casting out the racial Other.
        A number of the <a name="a" id="a">reviewers</a>, in northern papers like <i>The New York Times</i> as well as <i>The New Orleans Times-Democrat</i>,
        attribute "Tom's" villainy to his racial
        heritage.</p>

<p>Probably the most frequently praised element in the play was the story it tells of "Pudd'nhead's" eventual triumph over public contumely.  On the whole, reviewers gave little sign that the play was a serious confrontation with either slavery or race, treating it as essentially humorous, with strong elements of pathos and melodrama, and as a good account of the Old South, complete with quaint customs and fetching costumes.  It troubled one reviewer that Roxy was "white" but acted "black," but most admired the expressiveness with which her character was portrayed.  As you can see in the script, the theatrical business of the trial included some slapstick. Several reviewers, at least, objected to these comic bits as inappropriate in that situation. In general, however, the trial scene was seen as a thrilling conclusion to the gently but satisfyingly humorous "fun." <br /><br />
