          <b>In Mark Twin's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the Tremont</b>
        </center>

        <p>At the Tremont Theatre last night a good company of
        spectators witnessed the first performance in this city of
        Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson," in a dramatic form. The
        version presented was the work of Mr. Frank Mayo, who also
        impersonated the philosophical, astute, and unappreciated
        hero of the tale.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo was received with a friendly warmth, which
        testified in behalf of many in his audience, not only to
        their recollections of Tom Badger and Davy Crockett, but,
        perhaps, to their remembrance of the actor's remarkable
        performance of parts as difficult as Shakespeare's "King
        Henry VIII."</p>

        <p>Opinions differ as to the degree of exactness with which
        Mr. Mayo's work as a playwright has reproduced the
        personality of Mr. Clemens's chief figure. But the great
        majority of theatre goers will probably be willing to
        sacrifice much of the huge mass of the novel and will be
        quite satisfied with the substance of the plot and with the
        faithfully reproduced outlines of Wilson and his confreres
        of Dawson's Landing in Missouri.</p>

        <p>The story is certainly told in a succinct and
        interesting way. The basis idea -- the substitution of one
        infant for another much resembling it -- is old and has
        been made the theme of tragedy, melodrama and comic opera;
        but in "Pudd'nhead Wilson" the introduction of slavery and
        the "one thirty-second portion" of Ethopian blood, whose
        supposed possession dooms one of the children to a life of
        bondage gives a singular poignancy and pathos to the
        situation. No other contrast in conditions can be like
        that, for no difference between rich and poor, between high
        and low, between the well-reputed and the ill, is to be
        compared to the difference between the freeman and the
        slave. The added race prejudice completes the force of the
        situation.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo has been more than fairly successful in
        catching the life, spirit and quality of Mr. Clemens's
        sketches. The simplicity and provinciality of a rural
        village in a border slave state before the war, are
        admirably well reproduced. The peculiar high-bred Southern
        solemnity and that elaborate dignity so ludicrously close
        to pomposity, the Southern gallantry towards women, the
        Southern combination of gentleness and combativeness, the
        impenetrable Southern prejudice on the subject of race, and
        the Southern suavity and charm are all so well and so
        picturesquely suggested, that occasional extravagances and
        excesses may be excused.</p>

        <p>The performances must be pronounced to be, on the whole,
        admirably good. We are afraid that Mr. Mayo's impersonation
        of Wilson can hardly be regarded as quite convincing. But
        for that deficiency author rather than actor may be
        chargeable. Pudd'nhead Wilson is after all a grotesque and
        eccentric personage rather than a representative. He stands
        as a sort of humorous ideal of the shrewd, observing,
        deep-thinking man, whose superior wisdom passes for
        foolishness among his shallow associates. And Mr. Mayo
        makes him a striking, entertaining and very interesting
        figure. His large, simple style, his loping walk, his mild
        serenity and imperturbability, his slow, deliberate speech,
        his bashfulness of manner under excitement, his combination
        of long-suffering patience with deep-seated pride and
        conviction of his own superiority, are striking in Mr.
        Mayo's performance. His violent contortions of mouth, nose
        and face to express dissent, or doubt, or the entrance of a
        new idea into his head are less interesting, but cannot be
        rejected as mere absurdities, since they befit a character
        whose eccentricities were developed under conditions which
        developed eccentricity and encouraged it into a free and
        flaunting life.</p>

        <p>The only feature of Mr. Mayo's performance to which
        definite exception could be taken was the gross
        farcicalness of his pantomime at the beginning of his
        address to the jury. That was in an old and exploded vein.
        But for the most part, his playing was large in humor,
        dislayed native power and was easily and dramatically
        effective. Good acting abounded in the support. Mr. Arnold
        Daly's assumption of Chambers, the real white boy, was
        really exquisite in its delicacy, grace and sweetness, with
        a fine suggestion of interior underlying power. Mr.
        Campeau's performance of Tom Driscoll was a masterpiece of
        savage, cowardly blackguardism. Miss Eleanor Moretti, as
        Roxby, the slave mother, showed remarkable mastery of
        histrionic processes, and at times great force and fire,
        with contrasting cleverness in hitting the Ethiopian
        carelessness and levity. Her mode was sometimes too
        theatrical, but her picturesqueness and power were
        undeniable. Mr. Aiken's assumption of the serious judge who
        came from Virginia, Miss Grahame's of the warm-hearted
        Rowy, Mr. Klauber's and Mr. Hallton's of the Italian twins,
        Mr. Chisnell's of the sheriff, and indeed nearly every
        performer deserves favorable mention. The evening with
        Pudd'nhead Wilson is, on the whole, unique, and abounds in
        delightful experiences.</p>
