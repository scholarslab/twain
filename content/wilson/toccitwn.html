        <p>We give illustration of what are probably the most
        remarkable human twins that have ever approached maturity.
        They recently arrived in this country. They are known as
        the brothers Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci. They were born on
        July 4, 1875 . . . The twins are connected from the sixth
        rib downward, and have but one pair of legs and a single
        abdomen. . . . They have two distinct stomachs, hearts, and
        pairs of lungs. The arterial and respiratory systems are
        quite distinct; the heart beats and breathing differing
        often in the two individuals. . . .</p>

        <p>Their lives are distinct. They have regions of common
        sensibility, and of purely individual sensation. One often
        sleeps when the other wakes. There is no direct
        correspondence of their appetites. One may be hungry while
        the other is fast asleep.</p>

        <p>In their general appearance there is nothing repulsive.
        They have bright, intelligent faces, not of the peculiar
        cast common to cripples. They are educated and write their
        names as souvenirs for visitors.</p>

        <p>They are able to stand, but have not yet succeeded in
        walking, as each leg is governed by its own brain. The want
        of correspondence has proved fatal to any attempts in this
        direction. They can stand quietly, so that it is not only a
        question of strength. At their home they spend much of
        their time on the floor, using their inner arms for the
        most part, crawling and tumbling about and thus getting a
        certain amount of exercise. They can dress and undress
        themselves.</p>

        <p>The one on the reader's left as he faces the picture,
        Giavanni, drinks beer in considerable quantities. The other
        one, Giacomo, not liking beer, drinks mineral water in its
        place. Giovanni is quite fond of sketching and draws with
        some spirit. He rests the book or paper on his knee.
        Sometimes his brother, who is more of a talker and more
        volatile in disposition, finding some fault with the
        drawing, will kick the drawing off his knee. All this in
        good part, for they live on excellent terms with each
        other, and seem unconscious of any misfortune in their
        condition.</p>

        <p>They are disconnected as regards illness. Quite recently
        one of them had a cold, while the other was suffering from
        a bilious attack.</p>

        <p>The Siamese twins Eng and Chang, who died in 1874,
        within a few hours of each other, at the age of sixty
        years, were very celebrated. . . . Before the Siamese
        twins, the "Hungarian sisters," Helena and Judith
        (1701-1723), obtained much celebrity. Their region of
        connection was the sacrum. The South Carolina negresses,
        Millie and Christine, exhibited under the misleading title
        of the two-headed nightengale, were another interesting
        example of twinning. . . . They had four legs, and were
        really not much more closely connected than the Siamese
        twins. They enjoyed excellent health and spirits and used
        to sing together. They progressed by walking either on the
        rear pair of legs or on all four, in which case they moved
        sidewise. Waltzing was one of their accomplishments. . . .
        They were born about 1851.</p>
