         &nbsp; MT, whose need for cash at this time far outweighed any
        lingering misgivings he may have had about publishing his
        work in advance of the subscription canvas, sold the rights
        to the complete novel to <i>The Century Magazine</i> for
        $6500. The magazine brought the story out in seven monthly
        installments, from <a href="javascript:Start3('pwcent1.html')">December 1893</a>, to June 1894, with <a href="pwillshp.html#a">illustrations</a> by
staff artist Louis Loeb.
  As
        MT said in letters to his family in Europe, the
        installments attracted a good bit of other attention, which you can explore by clicking here:<br />

         &nbsp; As a <a name="a" id="a">promotional gimic,</a> <i>The
        Century Magazine</i> put together a pocket calendar for
        1894, "set up for Mr. Wilson" by <a href=
        "javascript:Start2('pw11.html')">"Henry Butts of Dawson's
        Landing"</a>. The tiny pamphlet featured one of
        Pudd'nhead's ironic aphorisms for each month in the year
        and <a href="javascript:Start('pwprints.html')">a brief
        account of fingerprints</a> taken from the novel. The giveaway
	was <a href="javascript:Start('calendarads.html')">widely advertised</a>, and enough
        copies must have been given away to require a reprinting,
        because two slightly different versions of the Calendar are
        in the Barrett Collection. At the end of one is a "<a href=
        "javascript:Start('pw10.html')">photograph of Mark
        Twain</a>" taken by "David Wilson" himself. At the end of
        the other is <a href="javascript:Start2('pwblurb.html')">a
        blurb</a> telling readers about the fun and thrills they'll find
	in this latest of "Mark Twain's romances."  In his biography of MT, Albert Bigelow
        Paine, who was 33 in 1894 and so is presumably speaking
        from his own experience, attests the success of both the
        book and the gimic: "The <i>Century</i> had issued a tiny
        calendar of the Pudd'nhead maxims, and these quaint bits of
        philosophy...were in everybody's mouth."  We can say for certain
that maxims from the calendar were quoted in many different periodicals, as you can explore by clicking here:<br />

         &nbsp; <a name="d" id="d">Like all MT's books,</a>
        <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> was first published "by
        subscription," which meant that you didn't buy it in a
        bookstore, but from a book agent who went door-to-door with
        a sample of the book for you to look at and "subscribe" to
        -- which meant entering into an agreement to buy the book
        itself at a later date. The entire prospectus the agent
        carried is available elsewhere in the MT archive. It
        contains 61 pages from the novel, and four pages of
        promotional material. Those last four also belong here.<br />

         &nbsp; <i>Pudd'nhead <a name="b" id="b">Wilson's New</a>
        Calendar</i> -- MT came back to Pudd'nhead and his homespun
        ironies a few years later, when he used more of these
        maxims as chapter epigraphs in <i>Following the Equator</i>
        (1897). He came back to Pudd'nhead in this way in part,
        obviously, because he hoped to continue to promote the
        novel, and in part because of the popular attention the
        first batch of Pudd'nhead's sayings had received. But
        whatever boundary had separated Sam Clemens' experience
        from Pudd'nhead's voice is even more permeable now: it is
        harder than ever to attribute what Wilson says in these
        "new" aphorisms with his character as it is developed in
        the novel. So it makes sense to think of the "Pudd'nhead"
        role as another of the disguises (like "Mark Twain" itself)
        Clemens found useful as a rhetorical resource.<br />

         &nbsp; Although <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> was never among MT's
        best-selling books, the connection between "Mark Twain" and
        the persona of "Pudd'nhead" remained vivid in his
        contemporaries' minds. Six years after the book appeared
        the Aldine Association threw a lavish dinner for MT. The
