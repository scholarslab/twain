        <p>Mr. Frank Mayo appeared last night at the Herald Square
        Theatre before a small audience in the initial production
        of his dramatization of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson."
        The audience seemed to be made up largely of the friends of
        the actor, an observation which applies, in point of time,
        only to the prologue and a portion of the first act. After
        everybody in the house had become the intimate of
        Pudd'nhead, the demonstrations of approval, at first merely
        friendly, became enthusiastic. Mr. Mayo's dramatization has
        preserved the flavor of the author's humor, and a real
        character walks the stage in the person of the client and
        [case starved?] country lawyer, with his shrewd philosophy
        and his contempt for the village blockheads who have made
        him the butt of their bucolic wit.</p>

        <p>The play is sufficiently melodramatic to give Mr. Mayo
        opportunity to employ the methods with which his long
        experience has made him familiar. If anything, it suffers
        from a little too much plot, involving a little too much
        "talky" explication; yet this defect is easily susceptible
        of correction. The action hinges upon an identification by
        means of the thumbmarks of two persons, the scientific
        study of which has been Pudd'nhead's hobby. This
        identification brings his enemies to confusion and the play
        to a triumphant close. One of the most effective situations
        is that at the close of the third act, when the
        investigator believes his cherished theory exploded, its
        effectiveness being gained by its extreme simplicity.
        Wilson's forensic oratory in the last act, also, is
        excellently conceived, having neither too much nor too
        little of the spirit of the backwoods advocate. Mr. Mayo
        was supported by a competent company. Miss Mary Shaw as
        Roxy, the white slave-mother, acted with force and
        generally with good judgment. Mr. Henley was weighted down
        with the part of a very bad villain. Most of the actors
        were remarkably consistent in the use of their Southern
        accents. The play is a refreshing contrast to so much that
        has been produced upon the New York stage this season in
        that it is absolutely decent.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo was obliged to respond to repeated curtain
        calls during the progress of the play, and at its close was
        obliged to speak his acknowledgements. He read the
        following dispatch from Mark Twain: "Cable me the jury's
        verdict." The audience cried in answer: "A success!"</p>
