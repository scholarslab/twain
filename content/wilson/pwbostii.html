 <br />        Less than a year after Mayo's death his version of
        <i>Pudd'nhead</i> was back on tour across America, now
        produced by Jefferson &amp; Mayo's Company (which included
        his son, who played Sheriff Blake), and starring Theodore
        Hamilton (referred to as an old stock company actor). By
        May, 1897, it had arrived back in Boston. The announcement
        below, which someone pasted into the front of one of the
        Barrett Collection's copies of the novel <i>Pudd'nhead
        Wilson</i>, was apparently cut out of a program from the
        Tremont Theater. It refers to all the characters as stock
        types, including Tom as "devilish and diabolical."<br />

        <p><i>The Boston Sunday Globe</i> announced the new
        production in a short notice that linked the drama to the
        essential character of the "negro":</p>

        <p>The play opened Monday night, May 3, and the next day
        the <i>Globe</i> reviewed it briefly. Proceeds from the
        opening night box office went to benefit the theater's
        treasurer, a detail that furnished the reviewer with a
        lead. This critic seems to associate the play with the
        genre of nostalgic plantation tales:</p>
