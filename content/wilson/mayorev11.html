"Pudd'nhead Wilson's" Return Visit to the New National</b></center>


<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" has been often enough in Washington not to need much of an introduction. He came two years ago in the person of dear old Frank Mayo, who created a new character on the American stage, but passed from the stage of life himself almost too soon to reap the fruit of his achievement. Then the public sadly said, "Mayo is no more, therefore we will no more know Pudd'nhead Wilson." But Mayo's mantle fell on the broad shoulders of Theodore Hamilton, and when that gentleman made his first appearance in the part in Washington the past winter, he was speedily recognized as Mayo's equal; in some points his superior. He came back again last night and was greeted at the National by a house full of old friends, who were glad to welcome both the character of Dave Wilson and its sterling interpreter.</p>
<p>Unlike the second round of current attractions, the company, as a whole, has improved rather than deteriorated. The actors, without being more perfect in their lines, which, in fact, was not necessary, seem to have rather grown into the characters they portray. Consciously or not, they have adopted The Post's previous suggestion, and make a less decided effort to affect the supposedly Southern accent, with the result that they come much nearer the genuine article. Mark Twain's story as a picture of Southern life could not be improved; and the actors, who seem to have grown by association into sympathy with its atmosphere, move peacefully and harmoniously through its varied action as if the stage were in truth the drowsy, ignorant, self-satisfied little settlement of Dawson's Landing.</p>
<p>But the action is not wholly quiet and peaceful. There are wonderfully strong dramatic situations that lift the audience at times and hold it in suspense, and again that move it to well merited applause. Chambers' chastisement of Tom Driscoll at the old mill and Slave Roxy's contemptuous revilement of her worthless son are both cleverly conceived and well executed. And Dave Wilson's bewilderment, when the puzzling thumb marks on the glass seem about to shatter all his lifelong theories, is one of the most speaking examples of the power of pantomime. That scene alone would establish Mr. Hamilton's claim to a foremost place among character actors. The story of the play is too well known to need rehearsal in detail. Its charm is in its atmosphere. Aunt Patsy Mason, in her side curls and glasses, and little Rowy, the impulsive, golden-haired antebellum maiden, might both have been brought to life from some old daguerreotypes. Both Chambers and Tom Driscoll have grown more into life in their interpretation of the Southern slave boy and his despicable young master, while the Judge, Howard Pembroke, the lawyer, Roxy, and the ubiquitous Sheriff are all beyond the need of compliments.</p>
