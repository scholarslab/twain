<p>MAYO GETS PUDD'NHEAD</p>

<p>Justice Prior, of the Supreme Court, yesterday afternoon rendered decision in the Pudd'nhead Wilson case. He decided that the manuscript of the play, being the work of the late Frank Mayo, reverts legally to the heirs of the Mayo estate. He ordered, however, that no settlement should be made until Wednesday, when Edwin F. Mayo must purchase from Manager Charles E. Evans the printing, scenery, costumes, and properties of the production. </p>
<p>This decision means that while Edwin Mayo acquires the rights to the play, he must buy Mr. Evans's share of the old partnership of Mayo and Evans.</p>
<p>Lawyer T. F. Atchison appeared for Mr. Mayo. Charles H. Batter represented Mr. Evans.</p>
