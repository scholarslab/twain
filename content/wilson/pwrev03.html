        <p>Mark Twain is an apostle of the unconventional, and he
        tells uncommon stories in uncommon ways. Being free from
        reverence for anything merely because it is customary, and
        being blessed with a fancy which knows no bounds, his
        readers are sure of meeting improbable situations, treated
        with a gravity beyond their deserts. It is one of the
        unexplained facts in the history of American literature
        that he has had no imitators. Possibly it is because his
        audacious extravagance has become so marked a
        characteristic that mimicry would be obvious at sight. Of
        late years his writings have shown a moral or social aim
        which, while it is sometimes overwrought and made to bear
        undue burden, is always of healthy tone.</p>

        <p>In <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> if we reflect upon the
        career--but lightly sketched--of the rightful heir, it
        seems to teach the greater force of education and habit
        than blood or heredity; certainly his pure white blood
        never taught him to feel his superiority over his
        surroundings. But the more minutely detailed behavior of
        his substitute appears to lead to the belief that
        antecedents and the inherited moral weakness of the slave
        were too much for training and environment. Perhaps the
        author would have smiled in his cynical way had he supposed
        that any attempt would be made at deductions of this
        nature, when his object, primarily at least, was to
        entertain. In this object, at least, he never fails, and
        while the story differs materially from the manner of his
        early works, it is as full as ever of his quips and shrewd
        jests on the weaknesses of human nature.</p>

        <p>One of the most characteristically funny features is the
        absurd explanation in which he takes his reader into his
        confidence by explaining how this story got away from him
        and left some of his people stranded, so that he had to
        retrace his steps and drown them at different times in the
        same well. This proving unsatisfactory because it was not a
        large well and would not hold any more, and recognizing the
        fact that he had got two stories entangled, he gravely
        "cures the defect" by pulling out the the farce and leaving
        the tragedy. What he calls the tragedy is much the best
        piece of work--in many respects he has written nothing
        better--but the appended story or farce is extravaganza run
        mad without sufficient base. It would have been more
        amusing if it had been shorter, but <i>Pudd'nhead
        Wilson</i> is good and the irony of the calendar is
        delicious. In these days of authors' block calendars,
        Pudd'nhead's sayings will well bear amplification for 1896.
        The illustrations are remarkably abundant, being in the
        form of marginal sketches on every page, and are in the
        main very satisfactory.</p>
