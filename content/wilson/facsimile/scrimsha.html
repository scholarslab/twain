  <h1>What is Scrimshaw?</h1>

  <p>From <i>THE DECORATIVE ARTS OF NANTUCKET</i>PP.159-161 by
  Charles H. Carpenter, Jr. and Mary Grace Carpenter. New York.,
  Dodd, Meade, and Company in cooperation with the Nantucket
  Historical Association and the Nantucket Historical Trust
  1987</p>

  <p>The common perception of scrimshaw as <a href=
  "tooth.html">whales' teeth with engraved pictures</a> is far too
  limiting. Any usable definition must take into account those
  myriad undecorated objects made through the eighteenth and
  nineteenth centuries of whale ivory and whalebone and
  whaling-related materials. Most definitions of scrimshaw stress
  its decorative nature. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary: "any
  of various carved or engraved articles made esp. by American
  whalers usu. from whalebone or whale ivory."</p>

  <p>We use the term scrimshaw in a broad sense, first as a noun,
  to include objects, decorated and undecorated, made from
  whalebone, baleen, and/or the ivory of whales' teeth and walrus
  tusks; and second, as a verb, to denote the making of such
  objects. A piece of scrimshaw, which may combine whalebone or
  whale or walrus ivory with such materials as wood, metal, or
  shell, should have a nautical association, being made on board
  ship or in an area where such materials were directly available
  from whalemen. The nautical or maritime connection is important,
  ruling out objects made of whalebone and whale ivory that have
  nothing to do with mariners or the sea. Thus, such things as
  medieval walrus-ivory religious carvings, eighteenth-century
  Dutch cutlery with baleen handles, whale-ivory netsukes, corset
  stays, and commercial ivory buttons are not classified as
  scrimshaw. The word scrimshaw is, according to the Oxford English
  Dictionary, "of obscure origin; the name Scrimshaw, if not
  actually the source, may have influenced the form of the word."
  The word has a number of variations in spelling such as
  scrimshon, scrimshant, scrimshont, scrimshander. The earliest
  known reference to the word appears to be in the log of the brig
  Orion, out of Rochester, Massachusetts. The entry for March 14,
  1821 reads:</p>

  <p>"First and middle part these 24 hours calm. Latter part light
  breezes and pleasant weather. All hands employed scrimshonting.
  So ends this day-no Whales and hard times."</p>

  <p>The earliest reference in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>
  is from <i>Moby Dick</i> or <i>The Whale,</i> 1851.</p>

  <p>A number of authors have speculated on the possible origin of
  the word scrimshaw. It has been suggested that it was related to
  the Low Dutch word <i>scrimshoning,</i> meaning those kinds of
  passing-the-time labor such as whittling; that it was a
  bastardization of a Nantucket Indian word, to denote the carving
  of a pipe or arrowhead; or that it came from eighteenth- or
  nineteenth-century American slang. We are uncomfortable with all
  of these explanations, agreeing with the<i>Oxford English
  Dictionary</i> that the word is "of obscure origin."</p>

  <p>The principal materials of scrimshaw, whale ivory, whalebone,
  and walrus ivory, should be described. Whale ivory, a sperm whale
  tooth, is a hard, dense, fine-grained material whose outer parts
  are white with a large darker center part. Walrus ivory, the tusk
  of a walrus, has a consistency similar to whale ivory, but has a
  center of compact crystals. Elephant ivory is softer than whale
  ivory. A cross section of elephant ivory has a wood-grain effect
  and the end grain has a hatchlike structure. American and British
  scrimshawers worked with whale ivory and whalebone, less often
  with walrus tusks, and only occasionally with elephant ivory.</p>

  <p>The fact that the word whalebone had two different meanings
  has caused confusion. Baleen, the traditional brownish-black
  "whale- bone" of commerce, used for stays and corset ribs, was,
  in a prechemical age, a natural plastic material, flexible and
  strong. Eighteenth-century Nantucketers used strands of baleen
  fibers in their bedsteads to support the mattress. The inventory
  of Samuel Barker, who died in 1740, listed: "whale sinew bed
  cord-0/5/0." Baleen is a flexible, hornlike substance that grows
  in the mouth of the right whale and other related whales. On the
  other hand, the white bone of the skeleton of a whale, although
  long used for scrimshaw, was not widely used in utilitarian
  objects before the middle of the nineteenth century, when it
  began to be employed for crochet hooks, knitting needles,
  bodkins, shoe- hook handles, and for bristle holders of brushes.
  Skeletal bone is a relatively hard, dense form of connective
  tissue, hardened by inorganic matter, chiefly calcium carbonate.
  The bone of a whale skeleton, like that of other mammals, is
  porous, with stringy cavities (appearing as surface streaks) that
  distinguish it from the harder, more uniform surface of ivory.
  Other materials used by scrimshawers include tortoiseshell,
  seashells, tropical woods, coco- nuts, pewter, and silver.</p>

  <p>We divide scrimshaw into two categories: (1) functional or
  utilitarian scrimshaw, and (2) decorated scrimshaw. (We use the
  term <i>decorated</i> scrimshaw to designate specifically scrim
  shaw that has been carved in a decorative manner or has images
  engraved<i>on</i> it. Any scrimshaw, decorated or undecorated,
  can be decorat<i>ive.</i>) There are, of course, a number of
  pieces of scrimshaw which fit into both the functional and
  decorated categories, that is, functional scrimshaw that has been
  decorated or carved, or vice versa. At the two ends of the
  definitional spectrum there is no problem. Engraved whales' teeth
  are clearly in the decorated category, while plain whalebone
  clothespins are certainly functional. Busks with engraved
  decorations <i>did</i> have a function but surely the decorations
  on them are more important. Cane heads may be beautifully carved,
  but most canes were primarily functional walking sticks. We do
  not want to labor these distinctions. We feel the division of
  scrimshaw into the two basic categories is valid and sufficient,
  even though there are objects that could fit in both
  categories.</p>

  <p>Functional and decorated scrimshaw were made in overlapping
  time periods:</p>

  <p><a href="func.html">Functional scrimshaw</a>1690-1900</p>

  <p>Decorated scrimshaw 1815-1900</p>

  <p>Although these dates are somewhat arbitrary, they have a
  rational basis. The 1690 date corresponds to the beginning of
  whaling on Nantucket. Offshore whaling was practiced by white men
  before this time on both Long Island and Cape Cod, but we know of
  no relevant artifacts of the time, although we do show whalebone
  articles made by Indians that predate the coming of the white
  settlers. The 1900 date was chosen as the approximate end of
  traditional nautical-associated scrimshaw, particularly on
  Nantucket. The return of the last whaleship, the <i>Eunice
  Adams,</i> in 1870 marked the end of island whaling. However,
  Nantucketers continued to ship out of other ports, particularly
  New Bedford, and they continued to make scrimshaw.</p>

  <p>Twentieth-century scrimshaw tends to be of two types: survival
  work by old-time whale- men in the first quarter of this century,
  and modern scrimshaw, sometimes in the style of the nineteenth
  century, and sometimes in a contemporary manner. The best of
  contemporary scrimshawers, such as William Gilkerson, Nancy
  Chase, and Robert Spring, are far more technically competent than
  the average sailor of the nineteenth century would have been and
  probably should not be compared with them. This is not to
  denigrate the work of the past. At its best, the pictorial
  scrimshaw of the nineteenth century has a charm and associational
  interest quite different from the studio productions of
  today.</p>

  <p>The date 1815 for the beginning of decorated scrimshaw is
  based on a study, "Early Dated Scrimshaw," published by one of
  the authors in 1972, listing all known pieces of scrimshaw dated
  before 1825. This list, which has been kept up to date, includes
  only one en- graved whale's tooth dated in the eighteenth
  century, plus two of the 1800-1815 era. The eighteenth-century
  example, a tooth engraved with a map of Boston harbor dated 1790,
  now in the Mystic Seaport Museum, seems more related to the
  engraved map-powderhorns of the French and Indian War than to
  later scrimshawed whales' teeth. It is clear that scrimshaw
  engraved with pictures of ships, port scenes, ladies, and
  children is a product of the nineteenth century, after 1815.
  There is a reasonable explanation for this. It was not until
  after the end of the War of 1812, in 1815, that really long
  voyages to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, averaging three and
  four years, became common. There was more leisure time aboard
  ship for such activities as scrimshawing on those long voyages,
  and the emphasis on sperm whaling meant there were more teeth
  available for engraving. The sperm whale had the large ivory
  teeth used by scrimshanders, while the other whale commonly
  hunted in the South Pacific, the right whale, had only baleen in
  its mouth.</p>

  <p>Scrimshaw was made everywhere, on board ship and ashore. It
  was not limited to the ships of any one port, nor to any one
  country, al- though most was made aboard American and British
  ships. (Eskimo scrimshaw does not concern us here, although
  examples (Chapter 12) were brought back to the island by
  whalemen.) Only a tiny minority of scrimshaw in museums and
  private collections can b&amp; attributed to a specific maker.
  Probably no more than one piece of authentic scrimshaw out of a
  hundred is dated.</p>
