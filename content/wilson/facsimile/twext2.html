  <p>When the budding attorney David Wilson arrives in Dawson's
  Landing he is democratically elected a "Pudd'nhead" because of
  his ironic comment about "half a dog." After he makes is comment
  about the disposal of the yelping dog, his statement is discussed
  among his new neighbors. He is discussed as "a lummox," or "a
  labric--just a Simon-pure labrick, if there ever was one," then
  as "a dam fool," and "a perfect jackass," though "it ain't too
  far to say he is a pudd'nhead."</p>

  <p>Thereby "Mr. Wilson stood <i>elected</i>. The incident was
  told all over the town, and gravely [ as well as democratically]
  discussed by everybody."</p>

  <p>Because this election usurps Wilson's status as a keeper of
  the law, Twain seems to suggests that the process of public
  opinion shapes not only individuals' careers, but the maintenance
  of legal systems in the old South.</p>
