    <hr />

    <p>Politics plays a powerful role in the shaping of identity in
    the town of Dawson's Landing both in obvious and subtle ways.
    In the literal sense, the political process is manifest in the
    various official elections staged throughout the novel. These
    elections decide who is popular and powerful, and who is
    ruined. But informal politics play a large role in deciding the
    fate and identity of the characters. David Wilson can only be
    what the town says he is (a pudd'nhead or a hero), and he must
    conform in order to be accepted. The twins are initially
    heralded by consensus fo the twonspeople, yet are destroyed by
    a rumor.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Twian's depiction of mob politics initially portrays
      David Wilson's<a href="twext2.html">naming as a
      Pudd'nhead</a> as a democratic process.</li>

      <li>At the thought of the twins' appearance, Rowena exclaims
      "they're ours," as if through contact with Angelo and Luigi
      her political status would increase. Yet as the story
      progresses, Wilson and the Twins switch status as a result of
      public opinion.</li>

      <li>When Tom Driscoll suggests to David Wilson and the hired
      detective that the knife belonging to the twins might still
      be in their possession, he starts a rumor which eventually
      has political impact upon the twins' reputation. As a result
      they are discredited during Percy Driscoll's speech.</li>

      <li>The economic status and ancestral lineage of the F.F.V.
      families have a profound impact upon their status in
      democratic poitics.</li>

      <li>David Wilson's christening as a "pudd'nhead" is portrayed
      as an election.</li>

      <li>Courtroom scenes of David Wilson are dramatized as a
      mixture of theatre and popular democratic appeal. In these
      scenes, Wilson plays to the mob, as much a politition and
      performer as an attorney. The courtroom spectators are
      portrayed as a performance audience and political body to be
      swayed through a manipulation of their prejudices. Twain thus
      conflates the triad of entertainment performance, politics,
      and democratic law.
