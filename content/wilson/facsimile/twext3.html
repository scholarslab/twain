    </table><font size="4">Twain questions symbols of lineage, the
    cornerstone of aristocratic rule, when he writes in his
    introduction of the town. He writes: "the candy-striped pole
    which indicated nobility proud and ancient along
    palace-bordered canals of Venice indicated merely the humble
    barber-shop along the main street of Dawson's landing." In the
    old-world the striped pole signifies nobility. It is humbled in
    the new world.</font>

    <p><font size="4">As Twain describes the town's "chief citizen"
    he depicts the Virginia gentleman as the self-conscious
    protector of status: "The chief citizen [of Dawson's landing]
    was York Leicester Driscoll, about forty years old, judge of
    the county court. He was very proud of his old Virginia
    ancestry, and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and
    stately manners he kept up its traditions. He was fine and just
    and generous. To be a gentleman--a gentleman without stain or
    blemish--was his only religion, and to it he was always
    faithful." Yet even the town was "faithful" to Driscoll's role
    as feudal lord, yet this choice to follow the F.F.V. tradition
    came as a democratic consensus which was motivated by
    economics.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4">Since Driscoll is the ever-popular "county
    judge," and at the same time an old Virginia aristocrat, he
    embodies a conflation of the democratic attributes of law and
    popularity as well as feudal rule and supremacy.</font></p>
