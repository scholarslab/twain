    <p>About the Author.

   <p>     JOHN A. KOUWENHOVEN, Professor of English at Barnard
    College, Columbia University, received his A.B. degree from
    Wesleyan University and his M.A. degree from Columbia. He is
    the author of Adventures of America,, 1857-1900, the
    Columbia Historical Portrait of New York, The Beer Can by the
    Highway; has contributed articles to Harper's, The Atlantic,
    The Yale Review, American Literature, The New England
    Quarterly, The Colophon, The Musical Quarterly and The
   Reader's Digest, and is on the editorial board of American
   Quarterly and of Technology and Culture.

   <h2> 10 Stone, Steel, and Jazz</h2>

   <p>     A civilization shaped by technical and industrial
    forces like those we have considered in the last chapter,
    working in collaboration with social and' political
    institutions which-in spite of two world wars and a cataclysmic
    depression-have retained a degree of democratic equality and
    per-sonal liberty unparalleled elsewhere, implies cultural
values
    and artistic forms which are not only different from those
    appropriate to the agricultural and handicraft-commercial
    civilizations of the past, but have also originated in an al-
    together different way. For the process by which techno-
    logical civilization has taken form has reversed that which
    operated in earlier cultures.

   <p> Hitherto, as Santayana pointed out in Reason in Society
    (1905), civilization has consisted in the diffusion and dilu-
    tion of habits arising in privileged centers: "It has not
    sprung from the people; it has arisen in their midst by a
    variation from them, and it has afterward imposed itself
    on them from above." But civilization in America, in so far
    as it can be identified with the vernacular influences this
    book has sought to define, has sprung from the people.
    What was "imposed on them from above" was the trans-
    planted tradition of an older culture.

   <p> From the point of view of those who have been trained
    in the cultivated tradition, the emergence of a civilization
    from popular roots has been a phenomenon of dubious
    merit. The fear of what is often called "popular culture,"
    in all its manifestations, is a notable feature of much his-
    torical and critical writing. To Santayana himself it seemed
    certain that "a state composed exclusively of such workers
    and peasants as make up the bulk of modern nations
    would be an utterly barbarous state." Indeed, those who
    think of culture as "the diffusion of habits arising in

    198 MADE IN AMERICA

   <p> privileged centers" are led almost unavoidably to the con-
    clusion reached by an anonymous writer in Harper's in
    19~8, that the future of culture in America is "clearly
    quite hopeless" because there is no church or aristocracy
    or other authority to modify or restrain what is assumed
    to be the human race's "natural taste for bathos."

  <p>  Back in the 1880S this attitude was already firmly es-
    tablished. Cultivated people everywhere tended to agree
    with writers like Sir Edmund Gosse that it was from Amer-
    ica that the real threat to established values came.

   <p>" Up to the present time, in all parts of the world [Sir
    Edmund wrote in 1889], the masses of uneducated or
    semi-educated persons . . . though they cannot and do
    not appreciate the classics of their race, have been con-
    tent to acknowledge their traditional supremacy. Of
    late there have been certain signs, especially in America,
    of a revolt of the mob against our literary masters....
    The revolution against taste, once begun, will land us
    in irreparable chaos."

   <p> Here was one aspect of that "perpetual repudiation of the
    past" that Henry James had observed. But what Gosse did
    not see, and could not have accounted for if he had seen
    was that this revolt was by no means confined to the mob.
    Eight years before Gosse wrote, the conservative and staid
    North American Review had published Walt Whitman's
    famous essay on "The Poetry of the Future" in which he
    argued that until America produced its own great poetry
    the "feudalistic, anti-republican poetry" of Shakespeare
    and the other great writers of the past "will have to be
    accepted, such as they are, and thankful they are no
    worse." Even the decorous William Dean Howells was
    publicly asserting a few years later that at least three
    fifths of the literature called classic, in all languages, was
    as dead as the people who wrote it and was preserved
    only by "a superstitious piety." What was happening, of
    course, was much more than a mere revolution against taste.

     <p> Stone, Steel, and Jazz 199

    <p>It was a revolution in taste-and it had its roots in
    the changing bases of civilization itself.

   <p> The man who, perhaps more clearly than anyone else
    in his time, understood what was going on was the engi-
    neer, George S. Morison, designer of the first of the great
    bridges across the Mississippi at Memphis and of many
    other bridges throughout the country. A powerful man,
    physically and intellectually, Morison had early abandoned
    what promised to be a successful career in law to go into
    engineering. He went to work under Octave Chanute, chief
    engineer of the Kansas City bridge, in 1867, and by the
    time the bridge was completed in June 1869, Morison had
    risen to be associate engineer. By 1875 he was interna-
    tionally famous as the man who-eighty-six days after fire
    destroyed the great wooden trestle which carried the Erie
    Railroad across the Genesee River at Portage-had designed
    and constructed the steel bridge which replaced it, and at
    the time of his death in 1903 he was widely recognized
    as one of the world's great engineers.

<p> Oddly enough, however, few people remember Mor-
    ison's book, The New Epoch as Developed by the Manu-
    facture of Power, published just after he died but com-
    pleted-and the preface dated-in Chicago in 1898. It is a
    strange, forcefully clear book, and an important one,
    though no historian of our civilization, so far as the present
    writer has discovered, has taken any note of it. Briefly, it
    argued that with the discovery of ways to manufacture
    power mankind entered a new ethical epoch which would
    transform civilization. What ultimate form the new epoch
    would take he did not specify, but he saw clearly chat the
    new mechanical and technical era would in the long run
    bring about fundamental changes in men's relationship
    with one another and with their environment. In many
    ways, he realized, the new epoch would inevitably open
    as an era of destruction. By its very nature it would destroy
    "many of the conditions which give most interest to the
    history of the past, and many of the traditions which peo-
    ple hold most dear." There would be destruction in both

    200 MADE IN AMERICA

    <p>the physical and intellectual world-of customs and ideas,
    systems of thought, and methods of education as well as
    of old buildings, old boundaries, and old monuments. How
    this destruction would occur, and how much time it would
    take, he did not care to guess. The important thing, he
    argued, was that it would come-"not because the things
    which are destroyed are themselves bad, but because how-
    ever good and useful they may have been in the past, they
    are not adaptable to fulfill the requirements of the new
    epoch."

   <p> Meanwhile there was danger. Some time might elapse
    after the old had been destroyed before the new was es-
    tablished in its place, and the trouble would lie in the gap
    between the two. "The next two or three centuries," he
    warned, "may have periods of war, insurrection, and other
    trials, which it would be well if the world could avoid."
    One of the greatest dangers, in this connection, would be
    the fact that the new epoch would destroy ignorance,
    spreading education not only to all classes in civilized
    countries but to savage and barbarous races as well. The
    most terrible "period" of all would be that time "when the
    number of half-educated people is greatest, when the world
    is full of people who do not know enough to recognize their
    limitations, but know too much to follow loyally the direc-
    tion of better qualified leaders."

   <p> Whatever the limitations of Morison's 134-page histori-
    cal essay, it nevertheless succeeded as few if any of its
    more ponderous successors have done in diagnosing the
    causes of unrest and chaos in our time. If we bear his
    thesis in mind we will no longer have any difficulty in
    understanding the link between Gosse and other cultivated
    writers of the genteel tradition in the eighties and nineties
    and their vigorous critics in the 1920S. On the surface, of
    course, men like J. E. Spingarn, H. L. Mencken, and Lud-
    wig Lewisohn were in open rebellion against almost ev-
    erything that the exponents of the genteel tradition had
stood for.
    But essentially the writers of the twenties were,
    in Lewisohn's phrase, trying as their predecessors had

   <p> Stone, Steel, and Jazz 201

   <p> done to awaken Americans to "the peril of cutting our-
    selves off from the historic culture of mankind." Even
    Irving Babbitt and the new humanists were doing their
    best to reinforce traditional standards which would correct
    that "unrestraint and violation of the law of measure"
    which was at the root of our cultural deficiency. The finest
    literary talent of a generation was dedicated to the task of
    setting up some authority which would restrain what in-
    evitably seemed, to anyone who cherished the values in-
    herent in European culture, to be the American's "natural
    taste for bathos."

   <p> Almost nobody among our writers seemed to realize, as
    Morison did, that destruction of those values was inevita-
    ble, however regrettable it might be, and that the great
    job to be done was to help discover and establish those new
    values, based upon the actualities of political democracy
    and industrial technology, which must one day-after who
    knows what misery and devastation-take their place.
    Those who sensed that this was so were left to struggle
    with the problem alone, till many were overcome by the
    fear of futility. There is no more pitiful record of this
     fearful loneliness than Sherwood Anderson's Perhaps Women
    (1931). Listen to the note of desperation in these words,
    for instance:

    <p>". . . when mechanical invention followed mechanical
    invention . . . I at least had not tried to get out of it
    all by fleeing to Europe.

    I had at least not gone to Paris, to sit eternally in cafes,
    talking of art.

    I had stuck and yet . . . all my efforts had been efforts
    to escape.

    Time and again I had told the story of the American
    man crushed and puzzled by the age of the machine.
    I had told the story until I was tired of telling it. I had
    retreated from the city to the town, from the town to
    the farm.

   <p> 202 MADE IN AMERICA

   <p> Watching an intricate machine at work, Anderson thought
    that the men who designed and built it might "some day
    be known to be as important in the life swing of mankind
    as the man who built the Cathedral of Chartres." And yet,
    he asked, can man, being man, actually stand, naked in his
    inefficiency before the efficient machine? And his answer
    was no, it cannot be done-not yet in any event. "They are
    too complex and beautiful for me. My manhood cannot
    stand up against them yet."

   <p> In his loneliness Anderson questioned whether men any
    longer had the power to make new values to replace those
    which the machine was destroying, and the point of his
    book was the despairing hope that perhaps women could
    do it for them. But he at least faced up to the challenge,
    which one woman had thrown at him, to "go and look"
    at the factories and machines which were shaping the new
    age, and to "stay looking."

   <p> Those who might have been expected to help in the ex-
    ploration of new values too often spent their time ridiculing
    or denouncing or lamenting what they called America's
    bourgeois taste. People like James Truslow Adams, whose
    study of the downfall of the Puritan theocracy in colonial
    New England should have taught him better, wrote arti-
    cles urging "the upper class" to refine and elevate the
    middle class and not be swamped by its "obscurantist preju-
    dices, its narrow and ignoble prepossessions, its dogmatism,
    self-righteousness, self-sufficiency." In an article published
    in a popular monthly in 1932-after Radio City and the
    George Washington Bridge had both been built-one of
    the future editors of the Reader's Digest declared that any-
    one who looked at American architecture and manners
    could see that for a decade or more we had been in the
    throes of an "uprising of serfs." The middle class, he
announced, had delusions of upper-class
    grandeur to which
    it was giving expression in structures like the Automat
    restaurant up near the Bronx with its huge cathedral win-
    dow and elaborate vestibule, in huge, "insincerely magnifi-
    ceny" movie palaces such as New York's Roxy and Para-

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 203

   <p> mount, and in overelaborate business offices designed to
    cater to what he contemptuously called "the demand for
    the dignity of industrial pursuits."

   <p> That demand was real enough, and the amount of
    money spent in an effort to satisfy it is a measure of its
    intensity. It is certainly true that there were plenty of in-
    appropriate guesses as to how that dignity should be ex-
    pressed. But the failure to find appropriate expressions, in
    architecture and elsewhere, should not have been taken
    as evidence that the demand itself was contemptible. The
    onus for buildings like the Roxy, the Gothic Automat, and
    the ornate business offices belonged not to those who de-
    manded beautiful surroundings for recreation and work
    without knowing how to achieve them, but to those who
    could not, or would not, share Louis Sullivan's faith that
    it was the architects job to affirm that which the people
    really wish to affirm-namely, the best that is in them. For
    as Sullivan knew, "the people want true buildings, but do
    not know how to get them so long as architects betray
    them with architectural phrases."

   <p> As one looks back at the twenties and thirties in the
    light of the argument which this book has developed, there
    is something rather touching about the desperate efforts
    Americans made to put utilitarian architecture behind
    them and to build beautiful things. We had been effec-
    tively taught, by those who we readily agreed were our
    betters in aesthetic matters, that what was useful was not
    beautiful. The architecture of the Chicago school-the
    highest manifestation of the vernacular tradition yet
    achieved-was discussed by Thomas E. Tallmadge in a
    chapter of his 197 history of American architecture en-
    abled "Louis Sullivan and the Lost Cause." Such architec-
    ture was doomed, he said, because of its demand for
    originality and for freedom from traditional styles. "What
    is the culture and genius of America" he asked; and
    promptly answered, "It is European.''1

    <p>Nine years later, in a revised edition of his book, Mr.
     Tall-madge changed the title of his chapter on Sullivan to
     "Louis."

   <p> 204 MADE IN AMERICA

   <p> It was no wonder, then, that the ordinary citizen who
    wanted beauty in his dwelling frequently turned, not to
    the vernacular for inspiration, but to the cultivated tradi-
    tion, convinced that to be beautiful a design must be both
    European and useless. It was in this mood that Americans
    built during the twenties those genial horrors that Charles
    Merz described in The Great American Bandwagon: the
    Italian wells that pumped no water, the Spanish balconies
    for houses with no rooms upstairs, and all the rest of the
    amiable but pointless lies of the Coral Gables era.

   <p> There were, of course, fine things being done all through
    this period. We were still building grain elevators and in-
    dustrial plants which, as the German architect Walter
    Gropius had written in the Jahrbuch des Deutschen Werk-
    bundes in 1913, had a natural integrity deriving from their
    designers' independent and clear vision of these grand,
    impressive forms, and which were "not obscured by senti-
    mental reverence for tradition nor by other intellectual
    scruples which prostrate our contemporary European de-
    sign." But in the twenties this mechanical architecture as
    Lewis Mumford pointed out at the time, had a vocabulary
    without a literature. When it stepped beyond the elements
    of its grammar-that is, when it moved from pure engineer-
    ing construction into the field of architecture proper, it
    usually could only "translate badly into its own tongue the
    noble poems and epics which the Romans and Greeks and
    medieval builders left behind them."

    <p>A dispassionate study of the relationships between engi-
    neering and architecture in the twentieth century would
    be of great value to an understanding of our civilization.
    What apparently happened was that the engineers, feeling
    the need for something more than the purely utilitarian
    satisfactions which their designs provided, turned to the
    architects for help, while at the same time the architects,
    sensing the vitality of engineering construction in contrast


   <p> Stone, Steel, and Jazz 205

   <p> with the sterility of traditional architecture, turned in-
    creasingly to the problems of giving architectonic expres-
    sion to the forms evolved by the engineers.

   <p> Any study of these interrelationships would, to be sure,
    have to reckon with certain questions which are posed by
    such a structure as the George Washington suspension
    bridge across the Hudson at New York. As it stands, the
    bridge is concededly one of the most beautiful structures
    in America. Other great suspension badges, like the
    Golden Gate Bridge, have more spectacular settings; but
    there is something about the George Washington's lofty
    yet sturdy towers, curving cables, and slender floor which,
    as the eminent badge designer David B. Steinman said,
    has made this bridge, to the younger generation of Ameri-
    cans, a symbol of our civilization. (See Fig. 29.) Yet, as it
    stands, it is unfinished; the original design worked' out by
    the engineers and the consulting architect has never been
    completed.

    <p>The bridge as originally designed was the work of O. H.
    Amman, chief engineer; Allston Dana, engineer of design;
    and Cass Gilbert, architect. According to the First Progress
    Report on the bridge, issued by the Port of New York Au-
    thority January 1, 1928, the guiding motives of the design,
    from the engineering point of view, were "purity of type,
    simplicity of structural arrangement, and ease and expe-
    diency of construction"-motives which, as we have fre-
    quently observed, are characteristic of the vernacular
    tradition. But, the Report continues, in designing this
   <p> bridge "it was realized that more than the usual attention
    must be paid to the aesthetic side," because of its monu-
    mental size and conspicuous location and because the
    bridge "should be handed down to posterity as a truly
    monumental structure, which will cast credit upon the
    aesthetic sense of the present generation." Here were the
    reverence for tradition and the intellectual scruples which
    Gropius had lamented in European design, and which ap-


   <p> 206 MADE IN AMERICA

   <p> peered in America wherever the cultivated tradition re-
    tained influence. The general outlines and proportions were
    purely vernacular in origin, dictated, as the Report said
    "by engineering requirements." But the towers, anchor-
    ages, and approaches "called for careful architectural
    treatment and dignified appearance." It was here, espe-
    cially in the towers, that the cultivated tradition would be
    called upon to create the beauty which it was assumed the
    vernacular alone could not achieve. The steel skeletons of
    the towers, designed to carry the entire dead and live load
    of the completed structure, were nevertheless to be im-
    bedded in a concrete casing faced with granite, in the
    design of which the architect had decorated the main arch
    with imposts, springers, and voussoirs and had provided
    other ornamental details which had no reference to the
    structural forces at work. (See Fig. 30.)

   <p> However, as the 63-foot steel skeletons of the towers
    rose from the shores of the river, something unprecedented
    happened. The "unexpected" functional beauty of the
    naked steelwork fascinated people, and there was a wide-
    spread popular protest against applying the masonry cov-
    ering which, according to the original plan, was to be the
    chief element in the aesthetic appeal of the bridge.3 So
    far as the present writer knows, the Port of New York
    Authority has never taken formal action to abandon the


    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 207

    <p>original design, and it is still theoretically possible that
    the towers will be cased in concrete and stone.4 The protest
    which prevented the "aesthetic" treatment of the towers
    was, after all, almost entirely a popular one, and the time
    may come when our betters in these matters will decide
    to go ahead with the design which they believed would
    best cast credit on our generation's taste. For to many
    people, apparently, it still seems difficult to believe that
    pure mathematics and engineering expediency can by
    themselves produce something beautiful. Even Chief En-
    gineer Amman himself, in his final report on the bridge
    in 1933, still insisted that the appearance of the towers
    would be "materially enhanced by an encasement with
    an architectural treatment" like Cass Gilbert's, though he
    admitted that the steel towers as they stand lent the struc-
    ture "a much more satisfactory appearance" than he or
    anyone else connected with the project had anticipated.

   <p> Nor is Mr. Amman the only civil engineer who is unable
    to accept the statement made fifty years ago by George S.
    Morison, past president of their society, that "architecture,
    which as a fine art would consign itself to the museum,
    . . . will find its highest development in correct construc-
    tion." For even in suspension bridges designed since the
    George Washington, the engineers have usually felt the
    need of some sort of architectural treatment for the tow-
    ers, such as the step-back of Joseph Strauss's Golden Gate
    Bridge or the steel cupola and spire indicated in Robin-
    son's and Steinman's studies for the proposed Liberty
    Bridge over the Narrows of New York Harbor. (See Fig.
    30. ) On the other hand, when architects have had a
    large part in bridge design they have shown increased con-
    fidence in the aesthetic force of unadorned engineering


   <p> 208 MADE IN AMERICA

   <p> forms, as witness the design by Aymar Embury II of the
    sheet-steel towers of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. (See
    Fig. 30 ) Mr. Embury, it is perhaps worth noting, was
    trained as an engineer before he began his work as an
    architect.

   <p> One of the most illuminating architectural careers of this
    period was that of Raymond M. Hood, who died in 1934.
    The buildings Hood designed from 1914 to the time of his
    death offer a startling record of the change from
    architecture conceived in terms of the cultivated tradition
    to architecture as the exaltation of vernacular forms.

   <p>Born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, educated at Brown
    University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
    Hood worked for a year as a draftsman im the office of
    Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson, then went to the Beaux Arts
    in Paris. After his return to this country in pgll, he worked
    for a while im an architect's office in Pittsburgh, then m 1914
    set up as an architect on his own in New York. For years he
    found little work to do, managing to keep himself going
    only with sustaining jobs like designing radiator covers. In
    1922, however, he suddenly leapt into fame as the
    co-author of the prize-winning design in the Chicago
    Tribune's $50,000 competition. (See Fig. 31.) The contrast
    between Hood's and Howell's tower, with its drapery of
    Gothic flying buttresses, and the design submitted in the
    same competition by the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen,
    has often been pointed out. Saarinen's design-"a soaring
    pile of receding pyramidal masses"-made no compromise
    with the essential nature of a skyscraper; Hood's tried its
    best to hide the fact that it was made of concrete and steel
    and glass.

   <p> How much Hood's later work was influenced by the bold
    design which was defeated by his own in the Tribune
    competition it is impossible now to say. His next big
    skyscraper was the black and gold American Radiator
    Tower im New York (1924), which was simpler than the
    Tribune Tower but essentially in the same vein. Even as
    late as 1929, in the Scranton Masonic Temple, he was still
    echo-

   <p> Stone, Steel, and Jazz 209


   <p>ing the Gothic which he had learned in the office of Cram,
    Goodhue and Ferguson. Then suddenly in 1930 he
    produced the Daily News Building, with its red stripes
    accentuating the vertical quality of its step-backed mass,
    and a year later the McGraw-Hill Buildmg (his favorite) in
    which the wide strips of windows are separated by
    horizontal bands of green-blue. (See Fig. 31.) Those two
    great buildings were the last, except for his share of the
    Rockefeller Center project, before he died.

   <p> What happened to Hood between the Tribune Tower
    and the McGraw-Hill Building would make a profoundly
    interesting study. No doubt it was in part the influence of
    his friend Joseph Urban which encouraged him to use color
    as an integral part of design. It is probable too that his
    partnership with the engineer Andre Fouilhoux taught him
    a great deal about steel, concrete, and glass construction.
    But such influences do not by any means answer the
    questions which his astonishing career raises. What we
    need to know, and someday may know when Hood's life is
    properly written, is what he meant when he said, late in life,
    to Kenneth Murchison, "This beauty stuff is all bunk." On
    the evidence of his two greatest buildings it seems safe to
    assume that he meant something very like what the Shaker
    elder, Frederick Evans, had meant back in the 1870s when
    he told Charles Nordhoff that Shaker buildings ignored
    "architectural effect and beauty of design" because what
    people called "beautiful" was "absurd and abnormal." Like
    the Shakers, the designer of the McGraw-Hill Building had
    an eye to "more light, a more equal distribution of heat, and
    a more general care for protection and comfort.... But no
    beauty"-if beauty was something apart from such things
    as these.

   <p> In all branches of architecture the influence of the
    vernacular has been increasingly effective during the past
    twenty years. First the depression and then the war
    created pressures which tended to overcome the retarding
    influence of the cultivated tradition and to encourage a
    bold acceptance of vernacular forms and techniques. There

    <p>210 MADE IN AMERICA

   <p> is increasing awareness that the best work in American
    architecture grows directly out of the democratic and
    technological necessities which force us to think in terms of
    economy, simplification, and fitness for human purposes.
    Writing in 1941, Talbot Hamlin listed some of the
    architectural high spots of the preceding five years: the
    Farm Security Administration's camps for migratory workers;
    the Hunter College building, Rockefeller Center, the Bronx
    Whitestone  Bridge; the new buildings of the Massachusetts
    General Hospital; the KauEman house-Falling Water; the
    planned community of Greenbelt, Maryland; the Norris Dam and
    its powerhouse; the high school at Idaho Springs, Colorado;
    the Santa Rita housing project at Austin, Texas; and Frank
    Lloyd Wright's buildings for the Taliesin Fellowship. Of all
    these structures, as Mr. Hamlin observed, only Wright's
     Kaufman house was a private
    dwelling; all the rest were designed for some socially con-
    structive purpose.

    <p>In a technical discussion of the FSA camps in a pro-
    fessional architectural journal Mr. Hamlin observed that
    the details of actual construction of these buildings were
    of extraordinary interest "because they show how the
    need for economy, creatively conceived, can itself become
    a means to new and beautiful architectural forms," as, for
    example, in the use of ventilating louvers as an important
    element of design in the Utilities Building at the Wood-
    ville, California, camp. (See Fig. 3~.)

    <p>Apparently [he continued] the San Francisco architec-
    tural office of the FSA approached every problem of
    architectural design, in big as in little ways, with com-
    plete freshness and innocence of mind. It had no fixed
    ideas as to windows or doors or interiors or exteriors.
    Nothing seems to have inhibited its logical approach to
    each problem; no foreordained picture of what had
    been done or what was usual held it back.

    <p>Very much the same sort of freedom characterizes the
    best of our industrial plants, especially those built during

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 211

    <p>the war, and here too it is economy which provided the
    impetus to imaginative construction. The late Albert Kahn,
    engineer and architect of such magnificent structures as
    the Chrysler Tank Arsenal in Detroit (see Fig. 3), the
    Olds Foundry at Lansing, Michigan, and many others,
    stated the matter very clearly in an article written for the
    Atlantic Monthly in 1947. Strict economy must, by the
    nature of the case, prevail in designing factories,
    especially those which were then called "defense projects."
    All non-essentials, everything which is not "purely
    utilitarian," must be eliminated.

    <p>The very observance of this requirement, however,
    often makes for successful design [Mr. Kahn contin-
    ued]. As a rule, the most direct and straightforward
    solution produces the best-looking structure.... Just
    as the mere clothing of the skeleton of a modern air-
    plane by designers with an eye for line and a sense of
    fitness produces an object of beauty, so the frank ex-
    pression of the functional, the structural, element of
    the industrial building makes for success.6

    <p>The triumph during the second quarter of this century
    of vernacular forms which emerged from a hundred years
    of firsthand experiments in patterning the elements of a
    new environment could be traced in many fields besides
    construction. In writing, for example, it would be easy to
    show how the tradition of reportorial journalism which
    first attained literary quality more than a hundred years

    <p>ago in Dana's Two Years Before the Mast had become,
    since Mark Twain's time, one of the principal shaping
    forces in our literature and could be traced as clearly in
    John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy as in John Gunther's 1 -
    side U.S.A. Indeed, journalism in this sense has become
    a distinctively American phenomenon. As Georges Bataille


    <p>212 MADE IN AMERICA

    <p>said in the critical journal which he publishes in France,
    writing like John Hersey's account of the atom-bomb's
    aftermath in Hiroshima illustrates a characteristic Ameri-
    can effort "to give reportage a foundation of rigorously
    factual detail" which is almost unknown elsewhere.

    <p>In the movies, again, one could observe the origin and
    development of an almost purely vernacular art form, the
    direct product of technology and the commercial organi-
    zation of popular culture. Those who were sensitive to the
    changing character of our civilization had anticipated
    something like the movies long before the technical means
    had been discovered. As early as 1888 David Goodman
    Croly, newspaper editor and sociologist, wrote a curious
    book called Glimpses of the Future in which-fifty years
    before publication of Finnegan's Wake-he prophesied
    the disintegration of the novel as an art form and sug-
    gested the use of colored pictures (in his day, chromo-
    lithographs of course) to take the place of descriptions of
    people and places, and of phonographs to reproduce the
    conversations between characters. That was as near as he
    could come, at that stage of technical development, to fore-
    seeing the Technicolor talking picture. But the point worth
    noting is that long before movie cameras or color film had
    been invented those who were aware of the vital forces
    in the new civilization recognized that the traditional art
    forms would be superseded by forms appropriate to a
    technological environment.

    <p>A study of the development of the movies, furthermore
    would provide a striking example of the interaction be-
    tween the cultivated and vernacular traditions. Earlier in
    this book that interaction was discussed in terms of archi-
    tecture, and we saw how the forms which had been in-
    herited from an older civilization were modified by such
    vernacular influences as balloon-frame construction. In the
    case of the movies, however, the process was reversed,
    and a vernacular form was modified by cultivated influ-
    ences. In the early stages movies were produced without
    any conscious aesthetic aim; the men and women who

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 213

    <p>made them were in the business of providing mass enter-
    tainment in a medium which had been created by ma-
    chines and science. Then, sometime in the twenties, culti-
    vated critics began discussing the films of D. W. Griffith
    and Charlie Chaplin as artistic achievements of the first
    rank. The movie makers themselves began to wonder if
    they weren't artists and shouldn't behave as such, and
    artists who had been trained in the techniques of older
    art forms like the theater began to move over into movie
    making. With the coming of the talking picture in the late
    twenties the movies became more and more like photo-
    graphed plays, and the confusion between what can prop-
    erly be called cinema values and those of the theater still
    marks much of Hollywood's output in spite of the success
    of such movies as The Informer and a few of the great
    documentary films like Pare Lorentz' The River.

    <p>The role of the vernacular in creating new art forms
    and altering the basis of old ones could be traced, too, in
    other fields: in modern dance, in the evolution of the ani-
    mated cartoon, of the comic strip, and of the radio serial,
    and in the effect of photographic techniques and movie
    scenarios upon fiction and poetry. But it is in music, es-
    pecially in the music loosely known as jazz, that we can
    most clearly perceive both the extent to which vernacular
    forms and techniques have succeeded in modifying older
    traditions and the degree to which the newer forms and

    techniques are still limited.

    <p>Jazz is a subject about which many people have very
    imtemperate opinions, and it will be well, for the purposes
    of this present discussion, if we can avoid the heated con-
    troversies which constantly rage not only between those
    who dislike it and those who like it, but even between the
    various cults of its admirers. We may as well avoid, in
    so far as possible, such bitterly disputed points as the pre-
    cise relationship between jazz and the music of primitive
    African tribes and the extent to which jazz has been im-
    proved or degraded by its divergence from the instrumen-

    <p>214 MADE IN AMERICA

    <p>tal music produced by colored bands im New Orleans
    sporting houses fifty years ago.

    <p>To begin with, then, let us agree that by jazz we mean
    American popular dance music, exclusive of waltzes, as it
    has been performed for the past quarter century or so. By
    this definition we mean to include not only the spontane-
    ous instrumental or vocal improvising called hot jazz,
    epitomized by such a performer as Louis Armstrong, but
    also the carefully rehearsed performances, featuring im-
    provised solos and "breaks," which professional dance
    bands like Benny Goodman's or Tommy Dorsey's give to
    everything they play-whether it be Tin Pan Alley tunes
    composed in the old operetta or ballad traditions, or melo-
    dies lifted from western European concert music, or pieces
    composed by Tin Pan Alley in imitation of hot-jazz im-
    provisations. In this broad sense jazz is a product of the
    interaction of the vernacular and cultivated traditions, but
    its distinctive characteristics as a form of musical expres-
    sion are purely vernacular.

    <p>Jazz is fundamentally a performer's art, and in this it
    marks itself off decisively from the music of the western
    European tradition. The composer, who is the dominant
    figure in Western concert music, is of almost no importance
    to jazz, for in jazz-in its most distinctive form-invention
    and performance occur simultaneously as the players have
    their way with the melodic or rhythmic pattern. It is true,
    of course, that musical improvisation has flourished im
    other cultures, and that even Western music of the culti-
    vated tradition had its roots in improvisatory processes.
    But never before have conditions favored the universal
    availability of a performer art. The emergence of jazz as
    what might be called the folk music of the American peo-
    ple is inextricably bound up with such technological ad-
    vances as phonographic recording and radio broadcasting.

    <p>Nor is it only in making jazz available that these tech-
    nological devices have been important. In the early de-
    velopment of jazz, for example, the player piano not only
    contributed to the dissemination of ragtime (a rhythmic

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 215

    <p>type which popularized many of the elements of jazz) but
    also imposed certain characteristics of rhythmic precision
    and even of tonal quality which became distinctive ele-
    ments of its techniques. Anyone familiar with the playing
    of accomplished jazz pianists knows how they can use
    "pianola" style, though usually only for humorous effect
    in these latter, more sophisticated days. Similarly, the
    microphone of the recording and broadcasting studios has
    had its effect upon the instrumental and vocal performance
    of jazz. The vocal techniques of singers as diverse as Louis
    Armstrong and Bing Crosby, Bessie Smith and Dinah
    Shore, have been devised-often with remarkable inventive-
    ness and sensitivity-to exploit the full range of possibili-
    ties in the microphone, and it is largely to the microphone's
    limitations and possibilities that the typical jazz band owes
    both its characteristic make-up and its distinctive instru-
    mental techniques. Indeed, these techniques have become
    such an integral part of jazz that it is seldom performed
    without the use of a microphone even in small quarters
    like night clubs and even when the band is not on the air.

    <p>It was precisely with the beginning of recorded jazz, in
    1918 and the years immediately following, that the instru-
    mentation of jazz bands began to undergo the changes
    which in the early twenties produced the orchestral com-

    <p>bination that is still standard. As long as jazz remained
    a
    localized phenomenon in the Storyville district of New
    Orleans, it retained the instrumentation which had first
    crystallized with Buddy golden's band in the 1890S: a com-
    bination of trumpet, valve trombone, clarinet, string bass,
    drums, and banjo. But as it spread to other parts of the
    country, and as recordings became increasingly popular
    after the phenomenal success which Victor made with its
    records by the Original Dixieland Band in 1918, new in-
    struments were added (notably the piano and saxophone)
    and the balance of instruments within the ensemble under-
    went important changes. From about 1921 on the standard
    jazz orchestra has consisted of three units: the brass
    (trumpets and trombones), the reeds (saxophones and a

    <p>216 MADE IN AMERICA

    <p>clarinet), and the rhythm section (piano, guitar or banjo,
    string bass or tuba, and drums). All kinds of variants have
    been tried on this basic arrangement; big "symphonic"
    bands have been organized, and there have been recurrent
    experiments with various "small band" combinations built
    around a piano, and even some highly successful trios,
    quartets, sextets, and so on. But the three-unit instrumen-
    tation remains the standard for both hot and sweet (or
    commercial) bands.

    <p>One of the most interesting aspects of jazz instrumenta-
    tion is that the rhythm section tends to remain intact,
    whatever variations may be made in the other units. A
    fifteen-piece band has four men in the rhythm section, and
    so has an eight-piece band. What this amounts to, of
    course, is a recognition of the fundamentally rhythmic na-
    ture of jazz. For it is its rhythmic structure that distin-
    guishes it from other types of music.

    <p>It is precisely this distinctive rhythmic structure which
    makes jazz such an extraordinarily effective musical form
    in our civilization, and we will be better able to under-
    stand its significance if we acquaint ourselves with the
    two rhythmic characteristics which give it its special
    quality.8 These characteristics are syncopation and poly-
    rhythm.

    <p>Syncopation, in the simplest terms, is the upsetting of
    rhythmic expectation by accenting a normally unstressed
    beat and depriving a normally stressed beat of its empha-
    sis. As such it is a device which is fairly common in west-
    ern European music, and consequently people who do not
    understand jazz frequently assume that jazz performance
    has merely borrowed a stock effect from traditional music
    and done it to death. But in a Brahms quartet, for exam-
    ple, syncopation is a special effect, consciously used for
    its striking qualities, whereas in jazz it is-as Winthrop

    <p>n Far and away the most useful analysis of jazz as a
     musical form is that by Winthrop Sargeant in the revised and
     enlarged edition of his book, Jazz: Hot and Hybrid, published
     in 1946. I draw heavily on Mr. Sargeant's work in this
     chapter.

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 217

    <p>Sargeant says-"a basic structural ingredient which per-
    meates the entire musical idiom."

    Even so, syncopation by no means accounts for the spe-
    cial nature of jazz. If it did, musicians trained exclusively
    in the cultivated tradition would produce jazz merely by
    continuously employing a device with which they are al-
    ready familiar-whereas all they would actually produce
    would be corn. For in addition to syncopation jazz is char-
    acterized by superimposing of conflicting rhythms which
    creates a peculiar form of polyrhythm. This polyrhythm,
    as Don Knowlton was apparently the first to recognize,
    consists of imposing a one-two-three rhythmical element
    upon the fundamental one-two-three-four rhythm which
    underlies all jazz.

    <p>This formula of three-over-four, with its interplay of two
    different rhythms, seldom is baldly stated in jazz melody,
    but it almost invariably affects jazz phraseology and gives
    it its unique stamp. Here, as in the case of syncopation,
    we are using a term which is familiar in the cultivated
    tradition of Western music; but, as with syncopation, the

    <p>term has a distinctive meaning in relation to jazz. As
    Sargeant points out, the commonest form of polyrhythm
    in European concert music-two-over-three-never appears
    in jazz, and the almost universal three-over-four of jazz is
    very rare indeed in Western music. Furthermore, in Euro-
    pean polyrhythm there is no upset of normal rhythmic
    expectation; strong beats remain stressed and no accent is
    placed upon unstressed beats. But jazz polyrhythm has
    the effect of displacing accents in somewhat the same way
    that syncopation does so.

    <p>The domination of jazz by these two characteristics
    means, as Sargeant makes clear, that the relation between
    jazz rhythms and those of music composed in the western
    European tradition is "so slight as to be negligible." In
    other respects, of course, jazz has been strongly influenced
    by the cultivated tradition. Both its scalar and harmonic
    structure are largely borrowed or adapted from western

    <p>218 MADE IN AMERICA

    <p>European sources, though even in these aspects jazz has
    developed certain peculiarities-notably the "barbershop" or
    "close" harmony which it shares with other types of American
    music including that of the cowboys and the hillbillies.7 But
    rhythmically jazz is a distinctive phenomenon.

    <p>The source of jazz polyrhythm is almost certainly to be
     found
    in the Afro-American folk music of the Southern Negroes. But
    from the point of view of our discussion, the important fact
    is that almost all American popular music, the commercial
    "sweet" as well as the hot variety, has wholeheartedly
    adopted both  polyrhythm and syncopation, and that both of
    these are devices for upsetting expected patterns. In other
    words this music which originated in America and spread from
    there to the rest of the world depends for its distinctive
    quality upon two rhythmic devices which contribute to a
    single effect: the interruption of an established pattern of
    alternation between stressed and unstressed beats.

    <p>This interruption of rhythmic regularity m jazz is perhaps
    most clearly exemplified by the socalled "break" or "hot
    lick"-the improvised solo bridge passage of two or four
    measures which frequently fills the interval between two
    melodic phrases. During the break the fundamental four-four
    beat is silenced and the solo goes off on its independent
    rhythmic and melodic tangents, until suddenly the band picks
    up the basic four-four beat again right where it would have
    been if it had never been interrupted. The effect is
   brilliantly described in the following paragraph from
   Winthrop Sargeant's book:

    <p>Sargeant makes a convincing case for the idea that this
    barbershop harmony is not an echo of the post-wagnerian
    chromatic effects of European music, but was developed from
    the structural characteristics of accompanying instruments
    like the guitar and banjo. It merely uses the chords you get
    by sliding the hand up and down the neck of the instrument
    while holding the fingers in the same relative position. Cf.
    Iazz: Hot and Horrid,
    pp. 100.

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 219

    <p>In this process the fundamental rhythm is not really
    destroyed. The perceptive listener holds in his mind a
    continuation of its regular pulse even though the orchestra
    has stopped marking it.... The situation during the silent
    pulses is one that challenges the listener to hold his
    bearings.... If he does not feel the challenge, or is
    perfectly content to lose
    himself, then he is one of those who will never understand
    the appeal of jazz. The challenge is backed up by the chaotic
    behavior of the solo instrument playing the break. It does
    everything possible to throw the listener off his guard. It
    syncopates; it accents everything but the normal pulse of the
    fundamental rhythm.... The listener feels all the
    exhilaration of a battle.

    <p>It is essentially this same sort of battle between
    unexpected, challenging melodic rhythms and the regularity of
    the fundamental beat which characterizes all jazz. In hot
    jazz, when almost all the players are improvising all the
    time and nobody really knows what anybody is going to do
    next, the exhilaration is more intense than in rehearsed
    performances spiced with improvised solos and breaks. But the
    difference is one of degree, not of kind.


    <p>Now a musical form which exploits and encourages this kind
    of free-for-all might logically be expected to be chaotic and
    disorderly in the extreme. As Louis Armstrong once wrote, you
    would think "that if every man in a big sixteen-piece band
    had his own way and could play as he wanted, all you would
    get would be a lot of jumbled up, crazy noise." And with
    ordinary performers that is exactly what you would get-which
    is why most orchestras play from scores in which, with
    varying degrees of success, an arranger has incorporated hot
    phrasing. But, as Armstrong concludes, when you have "a real
    bunch of swing players" they can pick up and follow one
    another's improvisations "all by ear and sheer musical
    instinct." It is the essence of good jazz performance to be
    able to cut loose from the

    <p>220 MADE IN AMERICA

    <p>score, and to know-or feel-"just when to leave it and
    when to get back on it."

    <p>Benny Goodman, explaining the basis of organization
    for the famous band he got together in 1934, put the
    matter thus: what he wanted was, first of all, "a good
    rhythm section that would kick out, or jump, or rock or
    swing," and secondly, musical arrangements that would
    be adequate vehicles for such a rhythmic section and at
    the same time would "give the men a chance to play solos
    and express the music in their own individual way." In
    other words, Goodman intuitively recognized that it is the
    rhythmic structure of jazz which reconciles the demands
    of group performance (the arrangement) and individual
    expression (the solos).

    <p>What we have here, then, is an art form which within
    its own well-recognized limits comes closer than any other
    we have devised to reconciling the conflict which Emer-
    son long ago recognized as the fundamental problem in
    modern civilization-the conflict between the claims of the
    individual and of the group. Everybody in a first-class jazz
    band seems to be-and has all the satisfaction of feeling
    that he is going his own way, uninhibited by a prescribed
    musical pattern, and at the same time all are performing
    a dazzlingly precise creative unison. The thing that
    holds them together is the very thing they are all so busy
    flouting: the fundamental four-four beat. In this one
    artistic form, if nowhere else, Americans have found a way to
    give expression to the Emersonian ideal of a union which
    is perfect only "when all the uniters are isolated."

    <p>By its resolution of this basic conflict jazz relates
    itself intimately with the industrial society out of which it
    evolved. The problems with which Armstrong and Good-
    man are concerned have much less to do with the problems
    of the artist, in the traditional sense, than with those of
    industrial organization. It is not in traditional art
    criticism that we will find comparable values expressed, but
    in passages like this from Frederick Winslow Taylor's
    Principles

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 221

    <p>of Scientific Management, published just seven years be-
    fore the first jazz recordings were issued:

    <p>The time is fast going by for the great personal or in-
    dividual achievement of any one man standing alone
    and without the help of those around him. And the
    time is coming when all great things will be done by
    that type of cooperation in which each man performs
    the function for which he is best suited, each man pre-
    serves his own individuality and is supreme in his par-
    ticular function, and each man at the same time loses
    none of his originality and proper personal initiative, and
    yet is controlled by and must work harmoniously with
    many other men.

    <p>In other ways, also, jazz relates itself to the vernacular
    tradition out of which it came. Like all the patterns which
    that tradition has created, it is basically a very simple
    form. Harmonically it is little more than the repetition of
    four or five extremely simple and rather monotonous chord
    sequences. Melodically, it consists of the repetition of ex-
    tremely simple tunes which, however lovely or amusing
    they may often be, are not subject to elaborate develop-
    ment, as are the themes of western European music. They

    <p>may be worried and fooled with in hot solos till they are
    practically dismantled, but they are not thematically de-
    veloped. Finally, even in its rhythm, where jazz displays
    so much ingenuity, it is restricted to four-four or two-
    four time.

    <p>As a musical form, then, jazz is so simple as scarcely to
    be a form at all. The "piece" being played always has, of
    course, at least an elementary formal pattern-a beginning,
    middle, and end; but the jazz performance as such usually
    does not. It merely starts and then-after an interval which
    has probably been determined more by the duration of
    phonograph records than anything else-it stops. But this
    structural simplicity accords with the other vernacular
    characteristics that jazz displays. The polyrhythmic and

    <p>222 MADE IN AMERICA

    <p>syncopated flights of hot solos and breaks, with their
    abrupt, impulsive adjustments to ever-changing rhythmic
    situations, give jazz an extraordinary flexibility; but they
    could exist only in a simple, firmly established musical
    framework. Similarly, it is the structural simplicity of jazz
    which makes it, like other vernacular forms and patterns,
    so suitable for mass participation and enjoyment and so
    universally available.

    <p>In these terms one can understand Le Corbusier's bril-
    liantly perceptive observation that the skyscrapers of Man-
    hattan are "hot jazz in stone and steel." Jazz and the sky-
    scrapers! It is these two, and jazz in a "more advanced"
    form than the other, which to one of the world's greatest
    living architects and city planners "represent the forces of
    today." And both, as we have seen, are climactic achieve-
    ments of the vernacular tradition in America. Neither im-
    plies anything resembling the cultivated tradition's nega-
    tion of or contempt for the actualities of a civilization
    founded upon technology and shaped by democratic po-
    litical and social institutions. (It is no mere coincidence
    that in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, and wher-
    ever authoritarian regimes have existed, the men in power
    have attempted to discourage if they have not forbidden
    the performance of jazz.)

    <p>Let it be clear that in making these points we are not
    implying the aesthetic superiority of jazz over western
    European music or of Rockefeller Center and the McGraw-
    Hill Building over the cathedrals of Chartres and Salisbury.
    Such comparative valuations have no place in the context
    of this book, whether or not they have validity elsewhere.
    Judged strictly in its own terms, jazz is admittedly limited
    in its emotional range. Like other vernacular forms, notably
    journalism and radio serials, it is pretty much restricted to
    moods of humor, sentimental sadness, and sexual excite-
    ment; it is difficult to conceive of a jazz performance
    which would evoke the moods of tragedy, of awe, or of
    spiritual exaltation which are found in the masterpieces of
    western European music. Furthermore, there is some ques-

    <p>Stone, Steel, and Jazz 223

    <p>tion whether jazz is capable of evolutionary development.
    To many critics it seems that jazz today is in all essential
    respects precisely what it was at the moment when it
    emerged from the New Orleans sporting houses to sweep
    the country. Others might agree with the present writer
    that works like George Gershwin's An American in Paris
    and parts of his score for Porgy and Bess, and more recent
    works like Robert McBride's Quintet for Oboe and Strings,
    give evidence of an evolutionary process whereby the ver-
    nacular jazz tradition interacts creatively with the culti-
    vated tradition, losing none of the former's vitality and im-
    mediate relevance but greatly augmenting its expressive
    range.

    <p>Certainly skyscraper architecture at its best owes more
    than a little of its success to cultivated influences which
    have modified its vernacular qualities. But the essential
    fact is that both of these forms fully acknowledge their ver-
    nacular roots. Both are forms of artistic expression which
    have evolved out of patterns originally devised by people
    without conscious aesthetic purpose or cultivated precon-
    ceptions, in direct, empirical response to the conditions of
    their everyday environment.

    <p>It is clear that these vernacular forms and the others we
    have touched upon in this essay do not-by themselves-
    yet offer a medium of artistic expression adequate to all
    our needs. Forms inherited from an older tradition still
    must play an important role if we are not to be aestheti-
    cally starved, or at least undernourished. Opera and poetic
    drama, for example, may be as moribund as their most
    candid critics assert, but there will inevitably be periodic
    attempts to rejuvenate them. And such attempts will be
    made not only because of the cultural (and social) pres-
    tige which attaches to these and many other heirlooms of
    the cultivated tradition but also because we cannot yet
    afford to let them die.

    <p>Meanwhile the techniques and forms of the vernacular
    are rapidly attaining widespread influence and prestige,
    and their popularity throughout the world serves to remind

    <p>224 MADE IN  AMERICA

    <p>us once again that it is not their specifically American
     quality, in any nationalistic sense, which gives them their
     fateful significance. The products of the vernacular in
     America do, of course, bear the stamp of the national
     character, just as the artistic achievements of other
     peoples display certain national characteristics. But these
     are superficial features. The important thing about the
     vernacular is that it possesses inherent qualities of
     vitality and adaptability, of organic as opposed to static
     form, of energy rather than repose, that are particularly
     appropriate to the civilization which, during
     the brief life span of the United States, has transformed
     the world. By an accident of historical development it was
     in America that this tradition had the greatest freedom to
     develop its distinctive characteristics. It should, however,
     temper any undue nationalistic pride which that fact might
     induce in us, to remind ourselves that people in other lands
     have sometimes been more ready than we to appreciate the
     human and aesthetic values of vernacular modes of
     expression. Foreign movies have, after all, frequently
     surpassed ours in creative realization of the cinema's
     potentialities, and European and South American architects
     sometimes seem to be more alive than our own to the
     expressive possibilities of vernacular construction.

    <p>As a nation we have often been hesitant and apologetic
    about whatever has been made in America in the vernacular
    tradition. Perhaps the time has come when more of us are
    ready to accept the challenge offered to the creative
    imagination by the techniques and forms which first arose
    among our own people in our own land.

    <p> 3 After this chapter was written the author came upon a
dis-
    cussion of this incident in Le Corbusier's book, Where the
    Cathedrals Were White (pg47). M. Le Corbusier agrees that
    the George Washington is "the most beautiful bridge in the
    world," and that it would have been utterly spoiled if the
    towers had been faced with stone "molded and sculptured in
    'Beaux Arts' style" as the architect had planned. But he seems
    to have picked up an impression that it was the farseeing wis-
    dom of a single "sensitive>, individual which caused the
    original design to be abandoned. Further, he fails to consider
    the implications of the fact that the bridge as it stands is a
    pure engineering achievement in the sense that the designer had
    no aesthetic intentions, but was merely solving functional
    problems and providing a structure upon which the aesthetic
    treatment" could be hung.
<p>
    <p> 4 The fact that Cass Gilbert's designs for the anchorages
     and approaches of the bridge were ultimately discarded in
     favor
    of much simpler designs by Aymar Emburv II suggests, how-
    ever, that Gilbert's designs for the towers may also have been
    permanently shelved. The Port Authority will not, however,
    make public any information on this point.

    Kahn's steel and glass factories were prefigured seventy
    years
    earlier m the temporary wood and glass exhibition building
    shown in Fig. 19.
