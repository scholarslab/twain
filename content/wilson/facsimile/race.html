      <li><b>Pudd'nhead Wilson</b> explores the idea of
      miscegenation through the characters Tom and Roxy. Both Tom
      and Roxy's slave status are the result of the sexual
      exploitation of slave women by members of the F.F.V.
      aristocracy. Through these characters, Twain calls into
      question the fractional nature of the color line; Roxy is
      one-sixteenth black, and Tom is one- thritysecond black, yet
      both are fully slaves. As David Wilson observes, in the South
      killing half a dog produces a whole dead dog, just as a
      "teaspoon of black blood" results in social incrimination and
      a life of misery.</li>

      <li>Besides applying the obvious meanings of race in
      Pudd'nhead Wilson which directly pertain to slavery and Tom
      Driscoll's and Roxy's partial African-American lineage, Twain
      toys with nineteenth-century racial stereotypes.</li>

      <li>The reader first comes into contact with Roxy as Wilson
      overhears her banter with Jasper. Her voice fits the
      "minstrel show" stereotype: "Clah to goodness if dat conceit
      o' yo'n strikes in, Jasper, it gwine to kill you sho.'" The
      reader hears Roxy's black voice before seeing her white
      features, so casts her as a black slave.</li>

      <li>Such a depiction contrasts with Twain's physical
      description of Roxy as "noble" and "stately." Through this
      contradiction, Twain confuses and complicates the reader's
      stereoptyes of African Americans.</li>

      <li>Twain subtly manipulates the theme of race as a dialectic
      between appearance and essence. He describes the two babies,
      the aristocratic real Tom Driscoll as visually
      indistinguishable from Valet de Chambers, who is a slave. He
      also discusses the markings of the striped pole which
      symbolizes European nobility as the marker of the humble
      barber shop in America; accepted visual standards of status
      become irrelevant.</li>

      <li>This striped-pole confusion of appearances is linked to
      the miscegenation which caused Roxy's and the false Tom's
      mixed race. The F.F.V. responsible appear as noble symbols of
      a pure European race, although their acts produce a humbled
      offspring. Twain exploits this irony in portraying the town's
      distress over a series of robberys, yet their acceptance the
      F&gt;F&gt;V&gt;'s theft of slaves freedom, and their virtual
      denial of forced miscengenation.
