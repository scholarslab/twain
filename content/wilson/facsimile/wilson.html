  <p><font size="5">M<font size="4">ark Twain originally conceived
  <b>The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson</b> as an extended comic
  novel that consisted of two separate strands. The dominant, comic
  strand related the Southern exposure of a European-born pair of
  Siamese twins who shared a single pair of legs. The remaining
  strand composed a tragedy of identity. Prior to publishing the
  work in 1894, Twain (a name meaning two) separated the tragedy of
  identity, <b>Pudd'nhead Wilson,</b> from the physical comedy,
  <b>Those Extraordinary Twins,</b> in what the author termed a
  "literary cesarean" birth. The publication of these two separate
  stories in a single volume stands as the result. This
  genesis--along with the focus on twins--suggests that
  <b>Pudd'nhead Wilson</b> emphasizes the multiplicity of
  identity.</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="5"><font size="4">The story dramatizes the
  tradeoffs the attorney David Wilson makes in order to achieve
  political, professional, and social status as a newcomer to
  Dawson's Landing. Despite his perseverance in collecting and
  interpreting fingerprints as a means of ascertaining identity,
  Wilson encounters the ostracism of the community and initially
  fails as an attorney. As a result, two sides of Wilson's identity
  emerge and develop: the one is the David Wilson who perseveres,
  the other the David Wilson who succumbs to social
  influences.</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="5"><font size="4">In parallel to its dramatization
  of society's influence on David Wilson's identity, the novel also
  critiques the identity of the Southern small town. Twain exposes
  a Southern strain of democracy as the impetus for Wilson's
  crisis. The ostensibly egalitarian democratic character of the
  small town society is a sham, a tragic tyranny of the masses
  sustained by the monarchical F.F.V. aristocracy's "unwritten,"
  feudal "natural" laws. They result in the complete enslavement of
  blacks, and social and ideological enslavement of the white
  people of Dawson's Landing.</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="5"><font size="4">Early in the novel Wilson enters
  Dawson's Landing as a lowly "outsider" from New York who is born
  of Scotch roots. He is naively unconcerned with fitting into the
  ways of the Virginia-based aristocratic, slaveholding society.
  For example, upon his arrival in this town he is elected a
  "pudd'nhead" for making an ironic comment about killing "half a
  [yelping] dog" in order to bring the town peace. Eventually
  Wilson does bring a sort of peace to the town by solving a murder
  mystery whose plot is ironically born of the town's corrupt
  social structures. But Wilson triumphs only after partially
  succumbing to the social machinations of the Southern town. In
  order to succeed, he must subscribe to people's racial prejudices
  and traditional aristocratic customs. Throughout this
  development, part of Wilson's identity remains intact; he
  perseveres as his old self, working at his hobby of
  fingerprinting. Eventually such perseverance produces the final
  evidence in the case of a criminal's identity and contributes to
  his acceptance by the society. The people of Dawson's Landing
  redefine the "pudd'nhead" as a hero. Yet at the same time,
  Wilson's original identity does not remain intact. It is divided.
  The peace he brings to Dawson's Landing comes at the sacrifice of
  a significant portion of his original self--the self that
  ironically commented on the futility of separating the components
  of identity through his suggestion of killing "half a dog" to
  solve a social problem. He succeeds not at the cost of "half a
  dog," but at the cost of his true identity and the integrity of
  the town's democratic social structures.</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="5"><font size="4">As I have argued, Twain's novel
  comments on the ways in which social systems shape identity, for
  the community dictates what Wilson can be. Throughout
  <b>Pudd'nhead Wilson,</b> a series of <a href="intr2.html">six
  themes</a> describe these identity- building social systems.
  Race, gender, politics, ancestry, law, and economics contribute
  to shape the nature of these social structures. While these
  themes can be separately identified and named--just as the
  "extraordinary twins" Luigi and Angelo, can act as individuals--
  they may also share textual locations at the level of the
  sentence or paragraph. Thus these themes also resemble the twins
  in that they are overlapping and mutually reinforcing; often they
  occupy the same footprint.</font></font></p>

  <p><font size="5"><font size="4">This Smartext Edition can
  perform a sort of "critical cesarean" of the six themes of
  Twain's novel. Throughout this text, I have identified separately
  each of the identity-structuring social themes that Twain
  employs. Race, gender, ancestry, economics, law, and politics
  appear as a series of separate links that can be selected
  throughout the text. This separation of thematic categories is
  not discrete or exactly distinct, but rather results from acts of
  critical judgment. Many of these passages overlap, bleeding into
  one another, so that a passage on, for example, slavery may also
  be identified as a citation for economics, law, race, ancestry,
  or even politics. Such overlapping among passages and thematic
  categories illustrates what I believe to be Twain's main point in
  <b>Pudd'nhead Wilson:</b> that elements which compose identity
  are socially constructed and mutually sustaining. Their essences
  are necessarily mixed. For Twain, the disassociation one element
  from a single set of social constructs is as impossible as
  killing half a dog, or surgically separating a set of Siamese
  twins who share the same heart, trunk, and legs.<br />
