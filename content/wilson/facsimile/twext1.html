    <p>Dawson's Landing is a place governed by a combination of
    old-world aristocracy and capitalist democracy. As a
    river-front community catering to steamboat traffic the town is
    <i>fronted</i> by "The main street, one block back from the
    river and running parallel with it, [which was] the sole
    business street." But the commerce of this street is not enough
    to sustain the economy of a town. In fact, "Dawson's Landing
    was a slaveholding town, with a rich, slaveworked grain and
    pork country back of it. The town was sleepy and comfortable
    and contented. It was fifty years old, and was growing
    slowly--very slowly, in fact, but it was still growing." In
    other words, the less visible, yet more powerful economy of
    Dawson's landing was rooted in plantations set back from the
    river, the "grain and pork country." This is a slave
    economy.</p>

    <p>But since Dawson's Landing is located " half a days journey,
    per steamboat, below St. Louis" slave life was not as severe as
    in the lower South, or "down the river". As Malcom Bradbury
    writes in the <b>Penguin Classic Edition</b> "the slaveholding
    economy [in Twain's location of the town] and the dominance of
    the families who have moved in from Virginia can be much more
    stressed; and hence the town has a much more feudal and much
    less northern air" (p.317). Since Dawson's Landing is located
    approximately halfway between St. Louis and Cairo (where harsh
    agricultural slavery starts on the river, according to
    <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>), slavery in Dawson's Landing is mostly
    domestic and governed by gentlemanly codes of Old Dominion
    behavior. These codes, which encouraged the humane (and almost
    human) treatment of slaves, give rise to one of the main legal
    dilemmas of Twain's novel: if a slave is a piece of property,
    how can he be found guilty of a human crime like murder?</p>
