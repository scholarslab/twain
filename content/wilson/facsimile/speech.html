  <p>Cordrescu's discussion of immigration and his naturalization
  speech reflect an ambililant relationship with his new nation.
  While his experiences have led to a critical view of capitolism,
  his life in communist Romania clearly left America as the most
  desirable alternative. Ultimatley his speech impliess a heartfelt
  patriotism which does not deny the contradictions of the American
  Dream.</p>

  <h1>The New Americans</h1>

  <p>I COULD never live in Romania again. I know I'm a full-fledged
  American, because I've been asked to help officiate at the
  swearing-in ceremony for new immigrants.</p>

  <p>IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE OFFICIAL: I will
  support and defend-</p>

  <p>CROWD: I will support and defend-</p>

  <p>INS OFFICIAL:-the Constitution and the laws of the United
  States of America</p>

  <p>CROWD:-the Constitution and the laws of the United States of
  America</p>

  <p>INS OFFICIAL:-against all enemies, foreign and domestic, so
  help me God.</p>

  <p>I never thought-in my wildest dreams-that I would one day
  share a podium with officials of the Immigration and
  Naturalization Service who gave me so much grief. Only in America
  could they be so casual about the past. Didn't anybody check my
  file?</p>

  <p>Anxious faces from forty-one nations stood before me. "Ladies
  and gentlemen, welcome to the hello-deck! The secret of
  capitalism is forgetting. The quicker you forget, the less you
  will suffer. On the other hand, if you choose not to forget, like
  the Native Americans or the Bruderhoff, you'll have a real tough
  time and you'll never be on TV unless I visit you-" That's what I
  wanted to tell them. (p. 189)

  <h1>Immigration and Naturalization Service: Speech to the New
  Americans of 1992</h1>

  <h2>HELLO, NEW AMERICANS!</h2>

  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends, and fellow citizens, I am Yakov
  Smirnov from Moscow, Russia, and I'm here to tell you that this
  country been very very good to me. I can have all the vodka I
  want.</p>

  <p>No, I'm not really Yakov Smirnov from Russia. I'm Andrei
  Codrescu from Romania and this country has been very very good to
  me. I can have all the tzuica I want but I won't because it's not
  good for my body.</p>

  <p>Romania was a Communist country when I was growing up
  (remember the Iron Curtain.) In school they told us that America
  was a bad place where the rich laughed in the face of the poor
  who went about begging in the streets. That America was a country
  where crime and racism made it dangerous to walk outside.</p>

  <p>My grandmother, on the other hand, whispered to me that in
  America "dogs walk around with pretzels on their tails. " Fat,
  healthy dogs. Big, hot pretzels. She also whispered that in
  America the "roads are paved with gold. " That wasn't as good as
  the dogs with the pretzels but she had to whisper because in
  Romania you could not say such things out loud.</p>

  <p>I myself imagined America as the place where I could be a very
  famous writer who could say out loud all the things that would
  land me in jail in Romania.</p>

  <p>When I came to America I found that the school and my
  grandmother were both wrong.</p>

  <p>The rich didn't exactly laugh in the face of the poor but they
  didn't smile kindly either. The rich gave only reluctantly to
  help their fellow human beings and only after the government made
  them do it. Crime was as bad as they said it was. And racism was
  real. The melting pot of America was a boiling cauldron of
  prejudice.</p>

  <p>And yes, in America some dogs not only walked around with
  pretzels on their tails but got their own burial plots in
  Hollywood. Some dogs inherited fortunes and were tended by human
  servants.</p>

  <p>But the roads were not paved with gold In fact, in 1992,
  certain wads are not paved at all because there isn't enough
  money to pave them with.</p>

  <p>Yes, there are beggars and poor people and very rich people in
  America. But mostly there are in-between people, people who are
  neither rich nor poor, people who have nice houses or apartments
  with a little garden or a balcony, people who treat their dogs
  very nicely if they have dogs, people who (for the most part) let
  each other talk, laugh, and vote however they please. People who
  do not have to whisper. And the roads, whether in good shape or
  not, can take you somewhere else if you do not like where you
  are. America is a big country and you can move anywhere you want
  in it without having to show your passport.</p>

  <p>Almost ten years ago I sat where you sit now and listened to a
  judge welcome me to America "You are now Americans, " the judge
  said "You can keep your native customs, you can keep your
  wonderful cooking and your churches, but you are not Chinese,
  Haitians, Russuans, or Romaniens any longer. You cannot hold the
  interests of your old countries above those of your new country.
  You are now Americans. "</p>

  <p>The judge spoke the truth. But the judge did not mention how
  hard it is to keep your customs, your cooking, and your language
  alive. The judge did not mention the loneliness of having left
  friends and family behind. He did not mention the embarrassment
  of different manners, the trauma of simple exchanges and
  transactions. He did not mention the heartbreak of watching your
  children forget where they came from.</p>

  <p>For me, this was all good. I came here when I was nineteen
  years old. My loneliness became a time to dream ambitious dreams,
  dreams of revenge and conquest, dreams of showing everyone that I
  was more than the skinny little foreigner with holes in his shoes
  who could not speak very good English.</p>

  <p>I also used my embarrassment so as not to take myself so
  seriously.</p>

  <p>One time, in Detroit, I asked a bus driver "Can I buy this
  bus?"</p>

  <p>I meant to say, "Can I ride this bus?"</p>

  <p>He pushed me away and said "Go buy the next bus!"</p>

  <p>I haven't bought that bus yet-but I just bought a car.</p>

  <p>And as for the heartbreak of your children becoming American,
  that is inevitable. I was only a child myself when I came here
  but now I have children of my own. They are very American. They
  like to read books but they also play sports. In Romania you
  either read books or played sports. You couldn't do both and my
  children, as American as they are, are very interested in where
  they come from. They are proud of it, in fact, because it makes
  them different.</p>

  <p>And so-- I would modify what the judge said to me ten years
  ago in this way:</p>

  <p>"You must make an effort to keep your old customs and to make
  others admire them, you must use your native cooking to make new
  friends and to bring your community together, you must make an
  effort to support the community life of your fellow immigrants.
  You are still Chinese, Haitians, Russians, and Romanians, but you
  are also American, which means that you can be better Chinese,
  better Haitians and Russians and better Romanians because you are
  living together with all of these other people and you can enrich
  each other throughyour differences You are American now, which
  means that you must forget the hatreds and prejudices of your own
  past . . . that if you are a Croatian-American you cannot fght
  your Serbian-American neighbor because that's what is going on in
  the old country. You cannot pass on to your children the
  prejudices and hatreds of the old country. You must always
  remember why you left your countries in the first place: because
  you were persecuted for your political beliefs, for your
  religious beliefs, or simply because you wanted to live a better
  material life.... No matter. All those reasons are precisely why
  you must heal the wounds of the past. America is the place where
  you must deliberately forgo revenge if you are to go forward. You
  can be born again here, but like a baby you must cancel the pain
  that brought you here.</p>

  <p>America was set up as a place to get away from the murderous
  sentimentalities of the old worlds, which does not mean that you
  must abandon or forget the beauties of your cultures. On the
  contrary. The greater and prouder the cultural difference you
  bring here the greater your success America changes with every
  single new citizen. America in 1992 is not the America I came
  into in 1966. Today, Spanish is spoken almost as much as English,
  and millions of people from Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific
  have come since then, changing the favor and look of the place,
  making America more colorful, spicier, more exciting.</p>

  <p>The American poet Walt Whitman wrote in 1855:</p>

  <p>I celebrate myself and sing myself,</p>

  <p>And what I assume you shall assume,</p>

  <p>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.</p>

  <p>And so it is. Today's song may be a bit darker and more
  difficult but it's still there.</p>

  <p>America is an idea in our minds. Every generation of new
  immigrants remakes America in the shape of what they imagine it
  to be.</p>

  <p>It's your turn.</p>
