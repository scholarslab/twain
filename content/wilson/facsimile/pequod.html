  <h1>The <i>Pequod</i> as Scrimshaw</h1>From <i>tHE DECORATIVE
  ARTS OF NANTUCKET</i>

  <p>Functional and utilitarian scrimshaw was an integral part of
  Nantucket life. The islanders used whale ivory and whalebone for
  practical purposes, for fence posts, tools, and for measuring
  sticks. These functional objects were al- most always well
  designed, sometimes quite decorative, contrasting the gleaming
  white ivory and bone surfaces with the browns of mahogany and
  other woods used in furniture and tool making. Decorated
  scrimshaw, which will be discussed in the next section, was
  different. Scrimshaw was decoratively carved, pictures were
  engraved <i>on</i> objects, decorating them for aesthetic
  purposes only.</p>

  <p>This dichotomy, these two ways of looking at scrimshaw, is
  very much in evidence in Her- man Melville's <i>Moby Dick.</i> An
  often-quoted passage speaks primarily of decorated scrimshaw:</p>

  <p>"Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New
  Bedford, and Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of
  whales and whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on
  Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right
  Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen
  call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately
  carve out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure.
  Some of them have little boxes of dentistical- looking
  implements, specially intended for the skrimshandering business.
  But, in general, they toil with their jack-knives alone; and,
  with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will turn
  you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner's
  fancy."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the descriptions in <i>Moby Dick</i> of
  undecorated objects made of whale- bone and whale ivory, objects
  that we classify as functional scrimshaw, are used for symbolic
  reasons, reasons that have little to do with the just-mentioned
  "lively sketches" on whales' teeth and busks. The "ivory
  Pequod,'' the "rare old" whaleship commanded by Captain Ahab, is
  itself presented metaphorically by Melville as functional
  (symbolically functional) scrimshaw:</p>

  <p>Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon
  her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a
  quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything
  except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. She was
  apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy
  with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A
  cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones
  of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
  garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of
  the Sperm Whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old
  hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base
  blocks of landwood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of
  sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she
  sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass,
  curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary
  foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt
  like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching
  its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow most melancholy! All noble
  things are touched with that."</p>

  <p>The <i>Pequod</i> was laden with whalebone and whale ivory as
  were many things on it. On deck, before departure, was "a strange
  sort of tent or rather wigwam . .. consisting of the long, huge
  slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part
  of the jaws of the Right Whale." There was the "ivory-in- laid
  table" in Captain Ahab's cabin, his "ivory stool," and, of
  course, Ahab's "bar- baric white leg," the leg that "had at sea
  been fashioned from the polished bone of a Sperm Whale's jaw,"
  the whalebone leg that re- placed the one lost in his first
  encounter with Moby Dick. Then there was Captain Ahab's
  counterpart, the English captain of the Samuel Enderby out of
  London, whose whalebone arm substituted for one lost in his
  battle with the White Whale:</p>

  <p>"With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other
  captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and
  crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in
  his walrus way, "aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones
  together!-an arm and a leg!-an arm that never can shrink, d'ye
  see; and a leg that never can run. Where dids't thou see the
  White Whale?-how long ago ?"</p>

  <p>We counted at least thirty references in Moby Dick relating to
  the use of whale ivory and whalebone in and on the Pequod. Only
  four of the references deal with engraved or deco- rated
  scrimshaw. Melville treats decorated scrimshaw as part of the
  scholarly background information on whales that permeates the
  book. He did not give such scrimshaw an emotional content and did
  not use it symbolically. It did not fit his purpose. On the other
  hand, the functional scrimshaw, the whale-ivory pins, the
  whalebone blocks, the "glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory"
  used by the Long Island Negroes, Ahab's "ivory" leg, the English
  captain's whalebone arm, are highly charged, emotive metaphors,
  part of the symbolism of Ahab's fanatical and suicidal search for
  Moby Dick, the White Whale.</p>
