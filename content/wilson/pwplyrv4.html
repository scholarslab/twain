        <p>No doubt "Puddin'head Wilson" is the play of last week
        that will have the longest life and, in the end, the
        greatest fame. It is not a particularly good play, speaking
        according to rule, for it is absurdly ill made, and full of
        superfluous stuff. Who are the twins, anyway, and why did
        they go to Dawson? They look like a new kind of "song and
        dance team," and doubtless they have meaning and
        identity--but in order to understand them one would be
        compelled to read Mark Twain's very latest story, and that
        is expecting too much of anybody.</p>

        <p>People stopped reading Twain with zest after
        "Huckleberry Finn." That was the last flower of his genius
        in the eye of the public. Of course, to him belongs the
        credit of creating the character of Lawyer Wilson and the
        man who wanted to know what on earth Lawyer Wilson could do
        with half a dog; and what possible legal defense he could
        make after he had killed his half, in the suit for damages
        brought by the owner of the other half, which would surely
        die. Mark Twain's sense of humor is still potent. But after
        merely glancing through his stories of the hustler at the
        Court of King Arthur and the bank-note wager, the multitude
        found that he belonged to a past generation. Everybody has
        read "Trilby" [a competing play playing in New York] and
        everybody else pretends to know all about it; but
        positively nobody, except a few tens of thousands of
        voracious readers of all sorts of fiction, know Mark
        Twain's story of "Puddin'head Wilson." Wherefore an
        elliptical "dramatization" of the story, in the manner of
        John Brougham, was a mistake.</p>

        <p><a name="a">But Mr. Mayo has not</a> measurably improved upon such plays
        as Brougham's "Dombey &amp; Son." He has, to be sure,
        invented a sentimental "element"; but he has not made
        nearly enough of the emotional side of Chambers. A strong
        scene in which that supposititious [sic] darky, thirty-one
        parts Caucasian and one part Ethiopian, should boldly
        declare his passion for Roxy, human nature asserting itself
        in spite of prejudice and environment, would vastly improve
        the play. Chambers is by birth white and aristocratic.
        Following Mark Twain, Mr. Mayo has made the pseudo Thomas a
        Becket a glaring example of the influence of inherited
        traits. He is vicious, because of a training antagonistic
        to his nature, cringing and cowardly. Similarly Chambers,
        on his part, might well develop other traits than courage
        and honesty. The domineering spirit of a race of rulers
        might show itself in him.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo is sometimes too profusely explanatory; at
        others he depends too much on a general knowledge of the
        story of his play. As an after-thought it may be stated, as
        the opinion of one peculiarly gifted in the matter of
        hind-sight, that the prologue in 1836 is quite unnecessary.
        It established the fact that Roxy, an octoroon slave, had
        charge of two children, both by the same father, and of one
        of which she was the mother, and that she sent the wrong
        one to the christening. This could be explained in a few
        words. In the first act the robberies have been discovered,
        and Puddin'head Wilson has his clue, before the twins
        arrive in Dawson. He tells his sister of the darky girl who
        climbed into Tom's room, and the subsequent apparition of
        Tom's face at the window. The arrival of the Italians and
        their installation as boarders at Puddin'head's are later
        incidents of the act. Yet we are solemnly informed
        afterward that the wonderful knife, with a history, was
        stolen from the twins on the night before Puddin'head got
        his clue.</p>

        <p>There are droll moments in the first three acts, and one
        strong scene, before the ruined mill, but nearly all the
        genuine strength and vital interest of the play are
        condensed in the last act, which is admirable. The play
        will probably grow in popularity in its present shape; but
        it would have a still better chance if Mr. Mayo would
        boldly employ a practical playwright to help him make it
        over, dispensing with the prologue and the jesting scene
        about the twins before they have been seen by the
        townspeople; and making the love of Chambers for Rowy a
        stronger element.</p>

        <p>It deserves a chance, for Mr. Mayo's portrayal of
        Puddin'head, the slow-going, sagacious philosopher and
        humorist, is one of the best pieces of character acting we
        have seen in many a day, and the acting of Miss Shaw, Mr.
        Henley, Mr. Edgar Davenport, Mr. Odell Williams, Mr.
        Whiting, Miss Graham, Mr. Harry Davenport, and, for that
        matter, all the others, is uncommonly vivid and
        effective.</p>
