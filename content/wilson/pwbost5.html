        <p>Those who argue that it is impossible for us to
        establish an American national school of drama because our
        nationality is so complex and varied sectionally, must
        occasionally feel the possibility of error; as, for
        instance, when such a play as "Pudd'nhead Wilson" comes
        into popularity.</p>

        <p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" is American because it could not be
        anything else. A change of name and a change of location
        would ruin it, for its charm is indigenous to the soil
        whence it springs; and, though the <i>locale</i> of
        "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is in the South, it is as American as
        "The Old Homestead," with its scenes in New Hampshire;
        "Shore Acres," with its scenes in Maine; "Davy Crockett,"
        with its scenes in Kentucky; "Kit," with its scenes in
        Arkansas.</p>

        <p>Here is a notable list of real American plays to which
        must be added "Rip Van Winkle," "Alabama," "yes, and "Uncle
        Tom's Cabin," as well as "The Danites," "M'liss," and
        several others which will come readily to mind. These plays
        are the forerunners of the American school of drama, which
        gives evidence of being a school of simplicity, and of
        quiet human pathos and sentiment, with a strong vein of dry
        humor running through. . . .</p>

        <p>And in dramatizing Mark Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead
        Wilson," Mr. Mayo has given us a new character, as firm and
        as true, and as real as Jefferson's Rip, or Thompson's Josh
        Whitcomb. As for the play, which he has made from the
        novel, it is in many ways remarkable. The central situation
        is one which could exist nowhere else, and at no other time
        than ante-bellum days in the South; for we have in the
        character of Roxy one which is capable of wonderful
        dramatic development. A quotation from Mark Twain, on the
        program of the production of this play at the Tremont
        Theatre, beginning November 24, said: "To all intents and
        purposes Roxy was as white as anybody, but the
        one-sixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other
        fifteen parts, and made her a negro. She was a slave, and
        salable as such. Her child was thirty-one parts white, and
        he, too, was a slave, and, by fiction of law and custom, a
        negro."</p>

        <p>Now from this idea, and through the changing of two
        infants, Roxy's negro child and the son of York Driscoll,
        there is evolved a strong and dramatic story; the mystery
        being finally solved through Pudd'nead Wilson's
        thumb-marks, and the melodramatic tinge to the story being
        lightened by the dry and pungent humor of the character
        sketching, in which Wilson stands foremost.</p>

        <p>But to me there was a consciousness of disappointment in
        the development of the story, due either to the author's
        note, or to the stage instructions of Mr. Mayo, or to the
        playing of the part of Roxy by Miss Eleanor Moretti. Miss
        Moretti played Roxy, not as the woman who was practically
        white, but as though the proportions had been reversed, and
        the fifteen-sixteenths had been negro. On this assumption
        she gave a vivid performance, full of color and strength;
        but it robbed the play of that touch of the irony of fate
        and "fiction of law and custom" which was so important a
        part of the original scheme. If Mr. Mayo desires Miss
        Moretti to play the part in this manner it would be more
        effective without the author's note; or, if the latter be
        retained, its observance in the playing would add
        materially to the success of a charming and already
        wonderfully successful play.</p>

        <p>Without a previous knowledge of the story upon which the
        play is based it is impossible to compare the two; but this
        seems to be hardly necessary in view of the fact that the
        play itself is strong in its story and binding in its
        interest. Though it moves slowly at times it is the
        slowness of perfect contentment, the enjoyment of dreaming
        in the shade on a warm summer's day, and not the slowness
        which breeds <i>ennui</i>. But it increases mightily in
        interest, and while faults might be found in minor details,
        they are of such a really trivial nature that they can most
        justly be passed lightly, as they in no way detract from
        the merit of the whole.</p>

        <p>It is in the acutely humorous treatment of the story and
        of the characters that the distinguishing feature is to be
        found, for the humor lies in a fair accentuation of the
        humors of humanity, and is of that quality which lies close
        to pathos. It is real humor, never boisterous, but running
        steadily like a refreshing stream. And it is this careful
        admixture of dramatic strength and interest with true humor
        and characterization which makes "Pudd'nhead Wilson" what
        it is.</p>

        <p>But the charm and interest lies very largely at present
        in the single character of Pudd'nhead Wilson as played by
        Mr. Mayo, and in the few eccentric, though true, characters
        which create a background in the form of the denizens of a
        small Southern community. Mr. Mayo's own work is reduced to
        an artistic nicety, and he contrives to convey his
        impressions by the lifting of an eyebrow, a meaning pause,
        or one of the countless other mannerisms which are to be
        found in rural philosophers and country grocery lawyers
        whose practice is confined to their immediate circle. It is
        because he actually lives in the role that in his hands
        Pudd'nhead Wilson becomes one of the most notable
        characterizations of recent years.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo has, as I have said, given to the stage a
        totally new character in the leading role, that of
        Pudd'nhead Wilson, an easy-going, good-hearted country
        lawyer, whose native shrewdness is little suspected by his
        fellow townsmen, but who is a philosopher unawares. There
        is the same lovableness which we find in Jefferson's Rip,
        albeit Wilson is not the good-for-nothing that Rip surely
        is, and comes out triumphant at the end, finally succeeding
        in driving common sense into the heads of his neighbors.
        Mark Twain's homely similes, quaint expressions, and
        humorous illustrations, all filled with common sense, slip
        from Mayo's lips as though they had found birth in the
        brain behind, for Mayo seems to be Wilson in every act,
        intonation and expression as surely as Denman Thompson is
        Uncle Josh or Joseph Jefferson is Rip Van Winkle.</p>
