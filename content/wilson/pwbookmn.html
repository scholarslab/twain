          <p>Every scientific experiment or discovery of direct
          human import is soon followed by fiction of which it
          forms the basis. That the finger-print method of
          identification has not sooner provided the matter of a
          tale is surprising. Mark Twain uses it here ingeniously.
          "Pudd'nhead" is another name for fool; it is applied
          hastily to Mr. David Wilson, a lawyer and surveyor, who
          in his leisure hours amuses himself with making "records"
          of the finger tips of his acquaintances. In the case of
          two children born on the same day, and bearing a strong
          resemblance to each other, one a child of consequence,
          the other the child of a slave girl, he made continuous
          records. Then one of them, the wrong one of course, was
          sold with the slave mother. The reader can develop the
          story from that point, or if not, Mark Twain will do it
          for him. As the mistake lasts for twenty-three hard
          years, in spite of Pudd'nhead Wilson's cleverness, the
          end is prevented from being a very cheerful one.</p>
