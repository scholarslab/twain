          <p>--Has Mr. Samuel L. Clemens found Missouri audiences
          or readers slow to appreciate his jokes? Mr. David Wilson
          comes to a Missouri town to push his fortunes. Unluckily
          his first utterance when he lands from a steamer -- did
          steamboats pass "every hour or so" up and down the
          Mississippi in 1830? -- is about a yelping dog, that if
          he owned half of the beast he would kill his half. This
          would have been a fair joke in New York; to the
          Missourians it seemed proof positive that the speaker was
          a fool. Hence the sobriquet of "Pudd'nhead" which the
          public opinion of the town fastens upon him. But he
          doesn't deserve it. On the contrary, he is a clever
          fellow. He understands, for instance, how the impressions
          of finger-tips may be made proofs of identity -- is not
          this again a little before date in 1830? This is the
          point of the story, which is a somewhat gloomy but
          powerful tale of the slavery times. "Mark Twain's"
          negroes are not of the Uncle Tom type; but the story is
          not on that account a less vigorous indictment of the old
          social order of the South.</p>
