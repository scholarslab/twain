        <p>The last thing Mark Twain did in 1906 was to get drunk
        and deliver a lecture on temperance, and the first thing he
        did in 1907 was to glory in the fact that he would be able
        to rejoice over other dead people when he died in having
        been the first man to have telharmonium music turned on in
        his house -- "like gas."</p>

        <p>Of course Mark Twain did not really get drunk any more
        than he delivered a real lecture on temperance. He imitated
        a drunken man and a temperance lecturer at one and the same
        time, and took all the glory for the lecture to himself
        while he blamed his Siamese brother for the jag.</p>

        <p>Those who have never heard that Mr. Clemens has a
        Siamese brother must be told that he only had such a
        relative for one night only, and the occasion was a party
        given to a few friends in honor of Miss Clemens, at the
        author's home, 21 Fifth Avenue, last night, or partially
        this morning, for all well-regulated cases of intoxication
        last more than fifteen minutes, even the imitations, and
        the imitation given last night and given in such style that
        even the most ardent admirer had to admit that Mark was a
        close observer, resulted in what might be termed
        colloquilly a "hold over." During the hold over Mr. Clemens
        had something to say about politics.</p>

        <p>The score or so of guests who had passed the evening
        playing charades and other games were surprised to see Mr.
        Clemens enter the drawing room on to the little stage, at
        11:30, dressed in the white suit he wore recently on
        Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington.</p>

        <p>With him, in a similar white suit, came a young
        gentlemen whom the author introduced to the company as his
        Siamese brother. The two had their arms about each other,
        and their suits were fastened together with a pink ribbon
        supposed to represent a ligature. Twain was rather short
        and broad and his hair was snow white. His brother was very
        tall and very slight and had black hair. It was easy to see
        that they were brothers. Mark remarked on the close
        resemblance almost as soon as he came into the room.</p>

        <p>"We come from afar," said Mark. "We come from very far;
        very far, indeed -- as far as New Jersey. We are the
        Siamese twins, but we have been in this country long enough
        to know something of your customs, and we have learned as
        much of your language as it is written and spoke as -- well
        -- as the newspapers."</p>

        <p>"We are so much to each other, my brother and I, that
        what I eat nourishes him, and what he drinks -- ahem! --
        nourishes me. I often eat when I don't really want to
        because he is hungry, and of course I need hardly tell you
        that he often drinks when I am not thirsty.</p>

        <p>"I am sorry to say that he is a confirmed consumer of
        liquor -- liquor, that awful, awful curse -- while I, from
        principle, and also from the fact that I don't like the
        taste, never touch a drop."</p>

        <p>Mark then went on to say that he had been asked to take
        up the temperance cause and had done so with great success,
        taking his brother along as a horrible example.</p>

        <p>"It has often been a source of considerable annoyance to
        me, when going about the country lecturing on temperance,
        to find myself at the head of a procession of white-ribbon
        people so drunk I couldn't see," he said. "But I am
        thankful to say that my brother has reformed."</p>

        <p>At this point the Siamese brother surreptitiously took a
        drink out of a flask.</p>

        <p>"He hasn't touched a drop in three years."</p>

        <p>Another drink.</p>

        <p>"He will never touch a drop."</p>

        <p>Another drink.</p>

        <p>"Thank God for that."</p>

        <p>Several drinks.</p>

        <p>"And if, from exhibiting my brother to you, I can save
        any of you people here from the horrible curse of the demon
        rum!" Mark fairly howled. "I shall be satisfied."</p>

        <p>Just then apparently some of the rum, or the influence
        of it, got through the pink ribbon. Mark hiccoughed several
        times.</p>

        <p>"Zish is wonderful reform -- "</p>

        <p>Another drink.</p>

        <p>"Wonder'l 'form we are 'gaged in."</p>

        <p>"Glorious work. We doin' glorious work -- glori-o-u-s
        work. Best work ever done, my brother and work of reform,
        reform work, glorious work. I don't feel just right."</p>

        <p>The company by this time was hysterical with laughter.
        Mark was staggering about on the improvised stage,
        apparently horribly under the influence. His brother still
        held the bottle and was still putting it to the use for
        which it was made.</p>

        <p>The laughter became so great that it was impossible for
        the old man to carry on the farce any longer, and in a few
        minutes the Telharmonium music, played a mile and a half
        away up on Broadway, was turned on and it was playing "Auld
        Lang Syne" when the New Year was ushered in.</p>
