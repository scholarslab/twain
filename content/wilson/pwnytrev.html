    [<i>This unusual "review" seems to assume everyone is already
    familiar with the story of MT's novel, and focuses its
    attention almost exclusively on the illustrations in the
    American edition. It ignores or forgets about the illustrations
    that appeared with the novel in</i> The Century Magazine<i>,
    and it attributes all the marginal illustrations to one artist,
    though two different names are attached to the pictures
    themselves.</i>]

          <p>Thanks to an artist who, though he does not draw well, is
          clever in grasping ideas, the fun and drollery and the
          comedy and tragedy of two of Mark Twain's most
          interesting stories have been multiplied many times.
          Those who have enjoyed "Pudd'nhead Wilson," with nothing
          but their imaginations to help them picture what sort of
          man the hero of the story was and what the scenes were in
          which he acted his part, will be glad to run through the
          story again along with the artist, who, it may be
          assumed, has recorded in his marginal pictures the
          author's material conceptions of the things he has
          written about.</p>

          <p>They may see that "well-fed, well-petted, and
          properly-revered" cat stretched at full length on the
          window ledge, "asleep and blissful with her furry belly
          to the sun and a paw curved over her nose." That was one
          of the sight's of Dawson's Landing. They may see the
          tinmonger's pole standing on one of the chief corners of
          the village, "wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots
          and pans and cups," giving noisy notice to the world,
          when the wind blew, that the tinmonger was close at hand
          ready for business. They may look upon Wilson when, as he
          entered the village intent upon establishing himself in
          the law business, he made the remark that ruined him for
          the time being. "I wish I owned half that dog," said
          Wilson. "Why?" somebody asked. "Because," answered
          Wilson, "I'd kill my half." The villagers decided
          promptly that a man who did not know that to kill half a
          dog would be death to the entire animal was without that
          important requisite for a lawyer, a legal mind.</p>

          <p>So all through the story the illustrator accompanies
          the text. He shows the village firemen drowning the old
          market house with water pumped through the little hand
          engine; he shows Wilson, when he had come to be somebody,
          addressing a mass meeting, a flag flying over him bearing
          the announcement that he is conducting a campaign for the
          Mayoralty, and in one of his best pictures he illustrates
          the text, "A devil born to a young couple is measurably
          recognizable by them before long; but a devil adopted by
          an old couple is an angel to them and remains so through
          thick and thin."</p>

          <p>But it is in "Those Extraordinary Twins," which is the
          second part of the volume, that the artist has done his
          cleverest work. This undoubtedly is because the story is
          the funnier of the two. There is an almost infinite
          amount of suggestion for an artist of the humorous vein
          in the story of the two-headed man whom Twain persists in
          regarding as really two men -- making one man sick while
          the other is well; making one fight a duel while the
          other protests against the performance; baptizing the
          good one while the other sputters curses; hanging the bad
          one while the other looks indignant, though he finally
          does consent to join in the kicking.</p>
