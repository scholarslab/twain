<p>TWAIN AT THE THEATRE.</p>

<p>Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens) occupied a box at the Herald Square Theatre on Saturday night, when he first saw Pudd'nhead Wilson, Frank Mayo's play dramatized from his story of that name.</p>
<p>Twain was recognized by several in the audience, and demands were made for a speech. The author finally stepped to the stage and apologized for his lack of preparation, on the ground that he had been "hemmed in all day by W. D. Howells and other frivolous persons."</p>
<p>"I will only say," he added, "that I congratulate Mr. Mayo. He has certainly made a beautiful play out of my rubbish. His is a charming gift. Confidentially, I have always had an idea that I was well equipped to write plays, but I have never encountered a manager who agreed with me."</p>
<p>Mr. Mayo was called before the curtain, but with the words, "I am too wise to make a speech," he darted from view.</p>
