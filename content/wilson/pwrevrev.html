  1894: January</h2>

<td>[<i>This isn't really a review of the novel, but it is
    interesting as a first response to the story. A regular feature
    of</i> The Review of Reviews <i>was "The Periodicals Reviewed,"
    a summary of some of the main articles in many American,
    British and French magazines and quarterlies. The following is
    from the account of the contents of</i> The Century<i>, written
    after the first installment of</i> Pudd'nhead Wilson <i>had
    appeared there in December, 1893. MT's novel ran in</i> The
    Century <i>until June, 1894, but for some reason</i> The Review
    of Reviews <i>never discussed or mentioned the story again. It
    would have been interesting to know what "moral" about race the
    author of this comment felt the novel finally pointed.</i>]

        <td>The feature of the number [i.e. the December
        <i>Century</i>] so far as fiction is concerned is the
        beginning of Mark Twain's serial novel, "Pudd'n Head
        Wilson," the scene of which is laid in Southwest Missouri
        thirty-five years ago. The first chapters give but small
        indication of that humor which made Mr. Clemens' fame.
        Curiously enough, the plot, if one may presume to prophesy
        from the first chapters, is going to center around the
        mixing up of two babies, one of whom is a white child and
        the other a mulatto with a slight strain of negro blood,
        the two being under the charge of the fond mulatto mother;
        so that we may expect to find Mark Twain drawing some
        healthy moral concerning the race problem before we are
        through with "Pudd'n Head Wilson."</td>
