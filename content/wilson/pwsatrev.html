          <p>Mark Twain's last book is a story of mixed babies and
          the ingenious detection of crime. It is not altogether
          another <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. On the other hand, it is
          a relief to find that it is not another <i>Yankee at King
          Arthur's Court</i>. Roxy, the slave woman, who changes
          the babies, is a delightful character, who stirs us with
          a warm and ready interest. For the rest, there is little
          that can be said to rouse enthusiasm. Pudd'nhead Wilson
          himself is a little unreal, too much of the <i>deus ex
          machina</i>, though there is much that is Twainian in the
          specimen sayings that illustrate his wisdom. Every
          chapter is headed with these extracts, and it is clear
          that Pudd'nhead Wilson is to Mark Twain what Poor Richard
          was to Franklin. In the means by which Wilson detects the
          murderer of Judge Driscoll we have an ingenious
          adaptation of the system of thumb-impressions, originated
          by Sir W. Herschell in India, as a method of identifying
          criminals. It is cleverly, if not entirely persuasively,
          worked out in the story. But the sketch of Roxy, the
          negress, is by far the finest thing in the book.</p>
