        </center>

        <p>In starting out to set down the adventures and
        observations of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," Mark Twain had in mind
        the production of a short story, but "Pudd'nhead Wilson"
        refused to confine himself to the limits of a magazine
        sketch, and now he has become a large book, a part of which
        is a spirited farce called <i>Those Extraordinary
        Twins</i>. "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is one of the wittiest and
        most original characters Twain has produced. There was not
        in him the capacity to be grave, despite the solemnity of
        some of the positions in which he found himself. This
        curious volume is as full of the characteristic humor of
        Twain as is the best of his work. In this book he seems to
        have recovered much of his old-time spirit--spirit that has
        been conspicuous by its absence in a great deal of Twain's
        work printed during the past ten years. The artist that
        illustrates this work has a very keen sense of humor;
        indeed, his appreciation of the author's humor is greater
        than his skill as a draughtsman. The outline drawings are
        often crude, but there is humor in every line of them.</p>
