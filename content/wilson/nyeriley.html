          [<i>At least twice when MT was asked to speak
          extemporaneously in front of a theatre audience, he wound
          up speaking at length on the topic of a kind of "Siamese"
          self. The second occasion, also included in this archive,
          was when he spoke <a href="mtonmayo.html">about Mayo's
          production</a> of</i> Pudd'nhead Wilson<i>. The first
          came several years before he began "Those Extraordinary
          Twins," when his old lecture agent, Major J. B. Pond,
          talked him into introducing the lyceum duo of Bill Nye
          and James Whitcomb Riley, whom MT refers to as Eng and Chang, the famous "Siamese twins" from half a century earlier.  This account of that speech is
          from Pond's memoir of his life as a theatrical
          promoter,</i> Eccentricities of Genius<i>.  In that book Pond says that he used the phrase "Twins of Genius" in 1884 to advertise MT's tour with Cable, but there's no evidence of that. Pond did, however, advertise Nye and Riley as the "Twins of Genius"; it's possible that MT's introduction of "these young people" -- both of whom were middle-aged -- may have inspired Pond to use that label, which in turn could help explain his confusion about MT and Cable.</i>]

        <p>The Nye-Riley combination started in Newark, N.J.,
        November 13, 1888. . . . I ran the show myself in Boston,
        securing Tremont Temple for the occasion. "Mark Twain" had
        come to Boston on purpose for the entertainment, as he had
        never heard these "Twins of Genius." I caught him in the
        lobby of the Parker House, and told him that he must
        introduce them. He replied that he believed I was his
        mortal enemy, and determined that he should never have an
        evening's enjoyment in my presence. He consented, however,
        and conducted his brother humorist [Bill Nye] and the
        Hoosier poet [James Whitcomb Riley] to the platform. Mark's
        presence was a surprise to the audience, and when they
        recognized him the demonstration was tremendous. The
        audience rose in a body, and men and women shouted at the
        very top of their voices. Handkerchiefs waved, the organist
        even opened every forte key and pedal in the great organ,
        and the noise went on unabated for minutes. It took some
        time for the crowd to get down to listening, but when they
        did subside, as Mark stepped to the front, the silence was
        as impressive as the noise had been, as Mark said
        afterward. At that supreme moment nothing was heard
        but--silence! I had engaged a stenographer to take down the
        speech, and this is what Mark said:</p>

        <p>"I am very glad indeed to introduce these young people
        to you, and at the same time get acquainted with them
        myself. I have seen them more than once, for a moment, but
        have not had the privilege of knowing them personally as
        intimately as I wanted to. I saw them first, a great many
        years ago, when Mr. Barnum had them, and they were just
        fresh from Siam. The ligature was their best hold then, but
        literature became their best hold later, when one of them
        committed an indiscretion, and they had to cut the old bond
        to accommodate the sheriff. In that old former time this
        one was Chang, that one was Eng. The sympathy existing
        between the two was most extraordinary; it was so fine, so
        strong, so subtle, that what the one ate the other
        digested, when one slept the other snored, if one sold a
        thing the other scooped the usufruct. This independent and
        yet dependent action was observable in all the details of
        their daily life--I mean this quaint and arbitrary
        distribution of originating cause and resulting effect
        between the two: between, I may say, this dynamo and this
        motor. Not that I mean that the one was always dynamo and
        the other always motor--or, in other words, that the one
        was always the creating force, the other always the
        utilizing force; no, no, for while it is true that within
        certain well-defined zones of activity the was <i>was</i>
        always dynamo and the other always motor, within certain
        other well-defined zones these positions became exactly
        reversed. For instance, in moral matters Mr. Chang Riley
        was always dynamo, Mr. Eng Nye was always motor; for while
        Mr. Chang Riley had a high, in fact an abnormally high and
        fine, moral sense, he had no machinery to work it within;
        whereas Mr. Eng Nye, who hadn't any moral sense at all, and
        hasn't yet, was equipped with all the necessary
        <i>plant</i> for putting a noble deed through, if he could
        only get the inspiration on reasonable terms outside. In
        intellectual matters, on the other hand, Mr. Eng Nye was
        always dynamo, Mr. Chang Riley was always motor: Mr. Eng
        Nye had a stately intellect, but couldn't make it go; Mr.
        Chang Riley hadn't, but could. That is to say, that while
        Mr. Chang Riley couldn't think things himself, he had a
        marvellous natural grace in setting them down and weaving
        them together when his pal furnished the raw material.
        Thus, working together, they made a strong team; laboring
        together, they could do miracles; but break the circuit,
        and both were impotent. It has remained so to this day;
        they must travel together, conspire together, beguile
        together, hoe, and plant, and plough, and reap, and sell
        their public together, or there's no result. I have made
        this explanation, this analysis, this vivisection, so to
        speak, in order that you may enjoy these delightful
        adventurers understandingly. When Mr. Eng Nye's deep, and
        broad, and limpid philosophies flow by in front of you,
        refreshing all the regions round about with their gracious
        floods, you will remember that it isn't his water; it's the
        other man's, and he is only working the pump. And when Mr.
        Chang Riley enchants your ear, and soothes your spirit, and
        touches your heart with the sweet and genuine music of his
        poetry--as sweet and as genuine as any that his friends,
        the birds and the bees, make about his other friends, the
        woods and the flowers--you will remember, while placing
        justice where justice is due, that it isn't his music, but
        the other man's--he is only turning the crank.</p>

        <p>"I beseech for these visitors a fair field, a
        single-minded, one-eyed umpire, and a score bulletin barren
        of goose-eggs if they earn it--and I judge they will and
        hope they will. Mr. James Whitcomb Chang Riley will now go
        to the bat."</p>

        <p>It was a carnival of fun in every sense of the word.
        Bostonians will not have another such treat in this
        generation. It was Mark's last appearance in Boston.</p>
