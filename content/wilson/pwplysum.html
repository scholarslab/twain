        <p>While several reviewers suggest Mayo erred in attempting
        to follow Mark Twain's story too closely, it's clear from
        comments scattered among the reviews that he made many
        changes in the plot of <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>. Apparently
        to increase the occasions for humor, for example, he gave
        the character of Sheriff Blake a lot more stage business.
        Since, as the announcement in <i>The New York Times</i> put
        it, "the novel lacks a love story, without which no drama
        is complete, Mr. Mayo has supplied this deficiency by
        introducing a sentimental element." For the sake of this
        element, apparently, Wilson is given a sister (Patsy) and a
        niece (Rowy).</p>

        <p>One intriguing suggestion in the reviews is that the
        romance subplot involves Rowy with "Chambers," even while
        he is presumed to be "black" and a "slave." It is clear
        that Mayo enlarged Chambers' role, and that the character
        was played sentimentally; presumably his love for Rowy
        remains undeclared until he and the rest learn that he is
        "white" and "free." In one respect the dramatization deals
        less euphemistically with the issue of miscegenation, for
        Mayo makes Tom and Chambers half-brothers, children of the
        same father: York Driscoll. That several reviews explicitly
        refer to the play as "decent" and "wholesome," however,
        suggests that there is very little direct discussion of the
        circumstances of Tom's conception and birth.</p>

        <p>A major change, though treated by the reviewers who
        mention it simply as a variation on MT's story, concerns
        the switching of the babies. That is the focus of the
        play's prologue. Roxy accidentally sends the wrong infant
        to the christening of York Driscoll's "rightful white son";
        the switch becomes her <i>mistake</i>. Thus Mayo eliminates
        any suggestion of Roxy's determination to save her son from
        slavery, or to enact her own rebellion against the system.
        The other consequence must have been to make her look like
        an awfully careless mother.</p>

        <p>The first act begins with Dawson's Landing already
        anxious about the robberies. Pudd'nhead has seen a "black"
        girl climbing into Tom's window, thus identifying the
        thefts with slaves. Suspicion apparently first falls on
        Roxy, then on Chambers, until Pudd'nhead reveals the true
        culprit in the courtroom. The trial scene takes up Act
        Four. It follows the duel, and the wounding (rather than
        the killing) of Driscoll. As in the novel, Luigi is
        accused, and so becomes Pudd'nhead's first client in 23
        years of waiting for one.</p><img src="pwbstad4.jpg" align=

        <p>The play struck most reviewers as Pudd'nhead's story,
        perhaps because of Mayo's stature as an actor. While all
        agreed that the most powerful thing in the play was the
        trial scene, there was almost as much approval for the end
        of Act Three, where Pudd'nhead (unaware as yet of the
        switched babies) is shaken by apparent refutation of his
        belief in fingerprints. That by the very end he winds up
        vindicated and triumphant was, for most, the point of the
        story: while virtue is often unrecognized, it will
        eventually be rewarded.</p>

        <p>Treating the play as essentially humorous, with strong
        elements of pathos and melodrama, and as a good account
        (complete with accents and costumes) of the Old South,
        reviewers gave little sign that the play was a serious
        confrontation with either slavery or race. It troubled one
        reviewer that Roxy was "white" but acted "black," but most
        admired the expressiveness with which her character was
        portrayed. Tom was invariably discussed as "a very bad
        villain"; several reviewers directly connected his evilness
        to his racial heritage. Apparently the theatrical business
        of the trial, with Pudd'nhead's exposure of Tom as the
        thief, the assailant, and a "black" slave, included a good
        deal of comedy. Two reviewers, at least, objected to two
        different comic bits as inappropriate in that situation. In
        general, however, the trial scene was seen as a thrilling
        conclusion to the gently but satisfyingly humorous
        "fun."</p>
