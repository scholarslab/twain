<p>A large and discriminating audience was gathered here last night, on the qui vive to note the difference of conception and enactment, if any, between the late Mr. Mayo's portrayal of the title-role and its present illustration by Theodore Hamilton. When it is stated that the latter acquitted himself with credit and received earnest and prolonged applause, in many instances from lamented Frank Mayo's most faithful and loyal admirers, the verdict may safely be considered as satisfactory and conclusive. The play is one of such sterling worth, that interest in its telling is not dependent upon the especial merit to be found in any particular character, and when it is known that the cast as a body is practically the same as seen in Mr. Mayo's lifetime, and still includes Frank Campeau, Eleanor Morretti, Newton Chisnell, Lucille La Verne, Frank E. Aiken and Frances Grahame, the performance as a whole may be classed as quite perfect. Roland Reed as The Wrong Mr. Wright is Messrs. Palmer and Knowles's Thanksgiving week attraction.</p>
