        <p>The scenes of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" are laid
        on the banks of the Mississippi in a Missouri village which
        he calls Dawsons Landing, and they occur away back in the
        mid-century years, when the black man was a slave, when New
        Orleans was the mecca toward which all things flowed in one
        direction, and St. Louis was the opposite pole of life on
        the lower Mississippi.</p>

        <p>The action of the play cannot fail to impress one who is
        familiar with the great Mississippi valley and its people
        with the local atmosphere which abounds in the story; the
        characters are not overdrawn; their prototypes can be found
        today in any river village between St.Louis and New
        Orleans. Slavery no longer exists, but the negro is there,
        lazy, shiftless, poor in poverty, yet happy as a lord. The
        villagers known in the play as "the wise men of Dawson"
        still live, and are engaged in sitting for hours at a time
        under the spreading awnings in front of the drugstore, the
        shoe shop, the postoffice, or the saloon, discussing the
        questions of the day.</p>

        <p>When the Missouri folks told Mark Twain's story in
        Boston last season it met with great favor. The play will
        return to the Tremont for its second visit tomorrow night.
        The cast, aside from Mr. Theo. Hamilton, who has succeeded
        Mr. Mayo as Pudd'nhead Wilson, Miss Ada Dwyer as Roxy and
        Edwin F. Mayo as the sheriff, will be the same as seen last
        season in the play.</p>
