<p>[<i>Special to The Mirror</i>]</p>

<p>Frank Mayo's dramatic adaptation of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" was given its first St. Louis presentation at the Grand Opera House last night. As the scenes are laid in Missouri, and the characters are Missourians, the play is particularly interesting to a St. Louis audience, and it made a hit last night. Mr. Mayo was seen to advantage in the title role, and was supported by a good company.</p>
