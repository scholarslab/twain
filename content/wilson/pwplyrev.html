          A Play of Considerable Interest, Acted<br />
          with Much Skill.
        </center>

        <p>Mr. Clemens's story of interchanged babies and the man
        who took prints of people's thumbs on bits of glass has
        been made into a play of four acts and a prologue, and at
        the Herald Square Theatre last evening the first
        performance of it took place. The work of dramatization was
        done by Mr. Frank Mayo, and he has accomplished a most
        difficult task with a degree of success that is somewhat
        surprising. The play is not a good one, judged by the
        technical standards, most of which it violates again and
        again, but not a few of its scenes are of undoubted
        interest, and at least one of them is marked by a strength
        of emotion so great that faults of construction can be
        easily forgotten.</p>

        <p>Like all plays made from books, "Pudd'nhead Wilson"
        lacks continuity of action. The incidents selected for
        presentation require and receive much explanation of a kind
        thoroughly undramatic, and, therefore, dull, and yet after
        all many of them are left vague and not easy to understand,
        except by recalling the story in its printed form. This,
        the inevitable consequence of contracting a broad picture
        to the limits of a proscenium arch, constitutes the chief
        weakness of Mr. Mayo's play, and may prevent it from being
        a popular success, but there is at least a probability that
        the piece may be saved by the picturesqueness and reality
        of the types it introduces, by the care and ability with
        which it is acted, and by the curious ingenuity with which
        its denouement is brought about. "Shore Acres" won favor on
        no better ground than "Pudd'nhead Wilson" can offer, and
        for reasons not notably dissimilar.</p>

        <p>The play follows the book with sufficient closeness. In
        the prologue the children are changed, not exactly as Mr.
        Clemens chose to do it, but quite as well. In the first act
        Tom and Chambers are shown as young men, and the villagers
        are talking about the mysterious thefts. The Italian twins
        appear and take lodgings in Wilson's own house. The second
        act brings the confession to Tom by Roxy that she is his
        mother. The third centres in the duel between Judge
        Driscoll and the Italian, and the wounding, not murder, of
        the former by Tom. The trial of the Count and the
        revelation of Tom's identity by the fingermarks made during
        his infancy bring the piece to a close.</p>

        <p>In the title role Mr. Mayo portrayed with a skill, which
        it would be difficult to praise too highly, the gentle
        Pudd'nhead, misjudged by all around him, and patiently
        waiting for recognition and appreciation from the ignorant
        villagers. The part is a delightfully sympathetic one, and
        Mr. Mayo played it with a simplicity and sincerity that
        enabled him to preserve all its humor, while never losing
        the dignity of an underlying seriousness.</p>

        <p>As Chambers, the "white nigger," Mr. Edgar L. Davenport
        did work quite as admirable as that of Mr. Mayo, and quite
        as difficult. Mr. Henley made a terribly realistic Tom
        Driscoll, heartless, cruel, and cowardly. Mr. Harry
        Davenport as the courtly Judge, Mr. Odell Williams as a
        comical, but not impossible, Sheriff, and Mr. Joseph
        Whiting as a lawyer, were all careful studies of character
        and harmonious elements of the pictures presented. The Roxy
        of Miss Mary Shaw was emotionally persuasive, while in the
        interpolated roles of Wilson's niece and sister, Miss
        Frances Graham and Miss Lucille La Verne both won cordial
        applause.</p>

        <p>The minor figures, jurymen, slaves, and the like,
        received more attention than is given to such accessory
        figures in many productions much more pretentious, and this
        fact had not a little to do with making the trial scene one
        of the most effective that has been put on the stage here
        for years.</p><font size="-1">David
