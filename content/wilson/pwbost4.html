        <p>Mr. Frank Mayo has long been favorably known as an
        actor, and he now demands attention as a dramatist. He
        appeared in both capacities at the Tremont theater last
        evening and won cordial applause from a well pleased
        audience. There were plenty of plaudits throughout the
        performance and after the third act the actor-dramatist was
        called before the curtain half a dozen times.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo has developed a very entertaining play from
        Mark Twain's story about the man who devoted most of his
        life to studying the lines on people's thumbs, and who
        consequently came to be regarded as a "pudd'nhead." It is
        not a particularly well-constructed play, technically
        considered, but it is brimful of bright lines, quaint
        character sketches and contrasted bits of humor and pathos
        which appeal very strongly to the sympathies of an
        audience.</p>

        <p>He has used excellent judgment in selecting material
        from the book, but he has tried to use too much. It is a
        common fault in dramatization of popular books, this effort
        to introduce a multitude of incidents, many of which are
        not sufficiently close in their relations to permit of
        intelligible presentation in the limited confines of a
        play.</p>

        <p>There were moments last evening when one who had not
        read the book might have found it difficult to understand
        certain happenings. Another fault is the excessive amount
        of explanatory dialogue about what has happened and about
        what is likely to happen. A properly-constructed play tells
        its story by action, rather than by dialogue.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo has however given us a play which almost
        everyone will enjoy, and it is a good wholesome play on an
        American subject. It is for the most part a comedy, but
        there are some stirring scenes of a melodramatic order.
        Pathos is not lacking, but it is not so real as the fun,
        which is always spontaneous and irresistible in compelling
        laughter. Many of the character sketches are extremely
        amusing, and although some of them are rather overdrawn,
        they all possess a suggestion of genuineness and seem
        thoroughly appropriate to the delightful southern
        atmosphere of their surroundings.</p>

        <p>The story is told in a prologue and four acts, and
        follows the book closely, so far as plot is concerned, but
        numerous changes have been made in minor incidents and
        character development. In the prologue the two babies are
        changed and the slave's son is accepted as the heir of the
        house. The first act begins when the children have grown to
        manhood. The rightful white son has been reared as a slave
        and the negro, with only a slight taint in his blood, lives
        as his half-brother's master. They are the sons of the same
        father.</p>

        <p>To pay a gambling debt, the negro, disguised as a woman,
        robs various houses, and his mother, who has returned to
        her old home to see him, is suspected of the crime and
        accused by her son.</p>

        <p>The suspicion falls afterward on the white slave, when
        Pudd'nhead Wilson's discovery of the unmistakable thumb
        mark convicts the guilty man.</p>

        <p>One of the best scenes is the play is act the close of
        the third act, when the gentle Pudd'nhead is made to
        believe that his cherished theory regarding the
        infallibility of thumb marks has been exploded. It is quiet
        and simple, but extremely effective. There is also a strong
        melodramatic scene between the slave mother and her son,
        and this awakened much applause last evening.</p>

        <p>But the best act from a dramatic point of view is the
        last. This is constantly interesting, and is developed with
        splendid dramatic skill until the very last moment, when an
        ill-timed joke from one of the characters mars the artistic
        effect of an otherwise impressive ending.</p>

        <p>The success of the play depends very much upon the title
        character. This is a deliciously quaint and humorous
        creation, and Mr. Mayo presents it with wonderous fidelity
        to life. It is vastly different from the heroic roles with
        which Mr. Mayo has heretofore been associated, and that he
        played it so delightfully was a pleasant surprise to his
        friends. It is a characterization sure to live and long be
        associated with the actor's name.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo is supported by a capable company. Miss Eleanor
        Moretti made an excellent impression as the slave mother,
        and in appearance fully realized the character. Her acting
        in the more impassioned scenes was very effective. There
        was a good deal of intense realism in Mr. Frank Campeau's
        impersonation of a cowardly and cruel rascal, and Mr.
        Arnold Daly gave an admirable portrayal of the rightful
        heir. There are several others in the cast who give careful
        and picturesque character sketches, and the scenery and
        stage accessories are beautiful and appropriate.</p>
