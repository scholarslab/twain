        vspace="9" alt= "TOCCI TWINS" /> As MT admits in his headnote to <i>The Comedy
        of Those Extraordinary Twins</i>, writing <i>The Tragedy of
        Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> gave him "a sufficiently hard time."
        According to his account, the idea for the story occurred
        to him when he saw a picture advertising the exhibition of
        the Tocci Twins. This was probably in late 1891. Apparently
        MT never saw the Tocci's in person, but he had been
        fascinated with the figure of the "Siamese twin" all
        through his career (see <a href="mttwins.html">Twain &amp;
        Twins</a>). The image of the Tocci's prompted MT to begin a
        farce, based on a conflict between two incompatible selves
        forced to inhabit one body. Most of this farce was
        published in <i>Those <a name="b" id="b">Extraordinary</a>
        Twins</i>.<br clear="left" />

        <p><a href="galtonfp.html"><img src="galtonc.jpg" align=
        "left" hspace="9" vspace="9" alt= "TITLEPAGE: GALTON'S FINGER PRINTS" /></a>MT worked on this
        humorous tale during 1892, but as he was writing it (to
        quote again from his introductory remarks about <i>Those
        Extraordinary Twins</i>), "it changed itself from a farce
        to a tragedy" when two characters he had introduced into
        the story, "a stranger named Pudd'nhead Wilson, and a woman
        named Roxanna," "intruded" themselves into the narrative
        and "pushed up into prominence a young fellow named Tom
        Driscoll." Tom had been in the tale originally as a rival
        to the fair-haired "twin," Angelo, for the affections of
        Rowena, whom MT calls "the light-weight heroine." In his
        new story, however, Tom became the son of Roxy, "a negro
        and a slave" passing as white. The manuscript survives (at
        the Morgan Library), but it doesn't clearly answer the
        question of why MT's intentions and the mood of his tale
        changed. In November, 1892, after he had already decided to
        feature the story of changelings but while the details of
        that plot were still evolving, MT acquired a copy of
        <a href="galtonfp.html"><i>Finger Prints</i></a>, by
        Francis Galton. Galton (1822-1911) was a British scientist
        and a cousin of Charles Darwin whose main interest was in
        heredity. He coined the term "eugenics." At several points
        in <i>Finger Prints</i> he discusses his subject in the
        context of race and class, although he acknowledges that
        the data will not support his "great expectations" -- that
        fingerprints would display racial differences. After
        reading Galton's book, MT enthusiastically decided to
        feature fingerprints in the story. In Chapter Two MT's
        narrator says Roxy's race is "a fiction of law and custom."
        When Wilson uses fingerprint evidence in the courtroom to
        prove Tom and Chambers' "true" identities, however, he is
        in a sense using them to establish race.<br clear=
        "left" /></p>

        <p><img src="holmes.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" vspace=
        "9" alt= "COVER: 1903 COLLIER'S MAGAZINE" /> MT's decision to feature fingerprints was either a
        cause or an effect of the way his story was becoming a kind
        of detective story. In the early summer, 1893, he made the
        wholesale manuscript revision he referred to as a "literary
        Caesarian operation," pulling out the story of the
        "Siamese" twins to "center" the entire narrative, as he put
        it in a letter, "on the murder and the trial." In this, the
        published version, Pudd'nhead Wilson plays the part of the
        analytical observer who will interpret the evidence and, at
        the end, solve the mystery and expose the criminal. Like
        twins, detectives were a longtime fascination of MT's. One
        even appears, briefly and ineptly, in <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
        (1875). Most of his variations on the theme of detection
        are burlesques or satires, intended to expose the genre
        itself. In <i>A Double-Barreled Detective Story</i> (1902),
        for example, he brings Sherlock Holmes to the American west
        and has him conspicuously fail to solve a murder. Arthur
        Conan Doyle's tales about Holmes began appearing in 1887,
        with <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> ("The Norwood Builder,"
        left, appeared in 1903). By the time MT wrote <i>Pudd'nhead
        Wilson</i>, Doyle's stories were extraordinarily popular
        with readers around the world. The design of those tales
        and the character of Holmes were clearly influences on the
        novel as MT wound up writing it, but it is perhaps an open
        question whether <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> imitates or
        subtly subverts the conventions of detective fiction.
        Wilson's "detection" of the murderer restores the social
        order that had been violated by both Roxy's switch of the
        babies and Tom's murder of Judge Driscoll, but the ante
        bellum society he restores is based on slavery.<br clear=

        <p><a href="barrnger.html"><img src="barrnger.jpg" align=
        "left" hspace="9" vspace="9" alt= "TITLEPAGE: BARRINGER'S ESSAY" /></a> <i>Pudd'nhead
        Wilson</i> is <a name="c" id="c">MT's most direct</a> and
        sustained imaginative engagement with the issues of slavery
        and race, but although it has never been controversial in
        the way <i>Huck Finn</i> is, there is no critical consensus
        about whether the novel is racist or anti-racist, about
        what the novel is saying or implying about race. Like Huck,
        the characters in the book are all shaped by a slaveholding
        culture, and so racist themselves. After living in Dawson's
        Landing for fifteen years, for example, Wilson thinks of
        the "drop of black blood" in Roxy's veins as
        "superstitious," and Roxy herself, though a "negro," has so
        completely internalized the society's prejudice against her
        that she blames her own son's baseness on the "one part
        nigger" in him. The idea that there was such a thing as
        "black blood" and that a drop of it could determine
        character was even more prevalent in the 1890s, when MT was
        writing, than in the ante bellum society he is writing
        about. The Jim Crow laws being enacted across the South
        were given a pseudo-scientific authority by the idea that
        race was hereditary, and that racial inferiority or
        degradation could be empirically established. Phrases like
        "black blood" and "part nigger" would, for its original
        readers, link the novel to such contemporary discourse. As
        an example of that, I'm including here excerpts from
        <a href="barrnger.html">an essay by Dr. Paul Barringer</a>,
        of the University of Virginia hospital, which defines the
        "negro" and the threat he represents to civilization in
        these quasi-Darwinian terms. In most of his writings, MT
        emphasizes the way cultural conditioning (what he calls
        training) determines identity and destiny. <i>Pudd'nhead
        Wilson</i> says, for example, that Tom "was a <a name="d"
        id="d">bad baby,</a> from the very beginning of his
        usurpation" -- which could be interpreted to mean that his
        "badness" reflects his nurturing, not his nature. But
        <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> also refers to his "native
        viciousness," a phrase that echoes the "scientific" racism
        of the times. In the manuscript of <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>
        MT wrote <a href="pwms.html">a passage depicting Tom's own
        anguished thoughts</a> about his divided racial
        inheritance, in which he specifically asserts that both
        "white" and "nigger blood" can be a source of high
        qualities, and specifically attributes his own viciousness
        to slavery, not innate savagery. But MT deleted the
        passage. Whether the published novel was calculated to
        challenge or reinforce contemporary doctrines like
        Barringer's is a difficult question to decide. If you look
        at the reviews included in this site, it's interesting to
        note that the first two, written on the basis of the early
        chapters as the story appeared serially in <i>The Century
        Magazine</i> -- one <a href="pwrevrev.html">northern and
        favorable</a>, the other <a href="pwsouthn.html">southern
        and unfavorable</a> -- both clearly assume that by telling
        the story of the changelings MT will vindicate the "slave"
        Tom in much the same way that, with the switch that occurs
        in <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i>, he affirmed the
        democratic worth of the "pauper" Tom Canty. The reviews
        that were written after the whole novel appeared, however,
        don't treat race or slavery as an
        important feature of the story.  One <a href="pwspecta.html">British review</a> calls the story a 
"vigorous indictment of the old social order of the South."  On the other hand, the only two American 
reviewers who notice the racial theme -- in the <a href="pwrev03.html">Washington <i>Public Opinion</i></a> and in 
the <a href="pwrev04.html">Hartford <i>Times</i></a> -- have no doubt that it confirms the hereditary effects of "white blood" and "nigger blood."   The 1890s were one of the
        lowest points in the whole unhappy history of race
        relations in America: there were more lynchings than at any
        time before or since, and in the Supreme Court's <i>Plessy
        v Ferguson</i> decision, the idea that any "black" ancestor
        meant you could be labeled "black" and segregated away from
        "whites" was upheld as the law of the land of the free.
        Whether and how <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> reflects and
        participates in these patterns is something modern readers
        have to decide for themselves.<br clear="left" /></p>

        <p><img src="dawsons.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" vspace=
        "9" alt= "DETAIL: 1894 PUDD'NHEAD WILSON ILLUSTRATION" />Chronologically the earliest source for MT's story
        was the world Sam Clemens had grown up in. He'd written
        about Hannibal before, notably in <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. As St.
        Petersburg Hannibal is called a "western" and a
        "southwestern" village; about the only hint in <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i> of the social themes that preoccupy
        <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> -- slavery, race, miscegenation --
        is the reference to the "white, mulatto and negro boys and
        girls" Tom could have found hanging around the town pump,
        if Aunt Sally hadn't made him whitewash the fence. Aunts
        and children played a large role in the farce MT began
        with, the comedy of the twins, but in the story he wound up
        writing, the tragedy of the changleings, they are pushed to
        the margins of the narrative. Probably after the farce
        started to darken, MT decided to move the village down the
        river, "half a day's journey, per steamboat, below St.
        Louis." Along with the move south, the racial issues that
        had been marginalized in <i>Tom Sawyer</i> come to occupy
        the center of the story. <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> is MT's
        most explicit look at Hannibal as a "slaveholding town."
        Dawson's Landing is Hannibal, re-viewed -- St. Petersburg
        re-imagined without <a name="e" id="e">a hint</a> of
        nostalgia.<br clear="left" /></p>

        <p><img src="pwladdr.jpg" align="left" hspace="9" vspace=
        "9" alt= "DETAIL: 1894 PUDD'NHEAD WILSON ILLUSTRATION" /> To the extent that <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> is the
        story of Wilson himself, and his rise to the status of
        celebrity in Dawson's Landing, I believe that another
        significant source was MT himself -- that is, Samuel
        Clemens' adult career as "Mark Twain." The story of how
        David Wilson went west "to seek his fortune," and fought,
        as the last chapter puts it, "against hard luck and
        prejudice" in order to become "a made man" is in essence
        the archetypal American success story. Its emphases,
        however, are particularly Twainian, especially in the way
        Wilson's quest is not for money or power, but for attention
        and popularity. He becomes a successful lawyer and Mayor of
        the village, but the climax of his story is his spectacular
        performance in the courtroom, one of the most elaborate and
        dramatic of the many performance scenes in MT's fiction.
        His achievement is described in the last chapter, when
        troops of citizens flock to him and require a speech. This
        was not only one of MT's specialties; it also echoes the
        happy ending at the end of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, where
        everything Tom says has become remarkable. If Wilson's
        triumphant performance in the courtroom, however, is an
        imagintive reenactment of MT's popular reception, it makes
        MT's decision to call the novel <i>The Tragedy of
        Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> that much more resonant.</p>
