        <p>[Puddn'head Wilson <i>is of course set in the world Sam
        Clemens grew up in, and involves the extremes of race and
        caste, "black" and "white," master and slave. MT's first
        version of switched doubles was set in Renaissance England,
        and involved the extremes of class, a prince and a pauper.
        The picture below is from the end of that novel, when the
        rightful identities are being restored -- although in the
        picture the brilliantly clad boy is actually the pauper,
        Tom Canty, and the Prince is in rags. The excerpted passage
        is from the beginning, when the two first realize they are
        twinned and within minutes find themselves lost in each
        other's identities. The first speaker is the Prince. It is
        interesting to note that when it comes to Elizabethan
        England, MT apparently felt a prince and a pauper from the
        poorest section of London would speak the same version of
        Elizabethan English.</i>]</p>

        <h3>From <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i><br />
        Chapter 3</h3>"...But tell me of thy Offal Court. Hast thou
        a pleasant life there?"

        <p>"In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is
        hungry. There be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh,
        such antic creatures! and so bravely dressed!--and there be
        plays wherein they that play do shout and fight till all
        are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and costeth but a
        farthing--albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing, please
        your worship."</p>

        <p>"Tell me more."</p>

        <p>"We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other
        with the cudgel, like to the fashion of the 'prentices,
        sometimes."</p>

        <p>The prince's eyes flashed. Said he, "Marry, that would I
        not mislike. Tell me more."</p>

        <p>"We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be
        fleetest."</p>

        <p>"That would I like also. Speak on."</p>

        <p>"In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in
        the river, and each doth duck his neighbor, and spatter him
        with water, and dive and shout and tumble and"--</p>

        <p>"'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it
        once! Prithee go on."</p>

        <p>"We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we
        play in the sand, each covering his neighbor up; and times
        we make mud pastry--oh, the lovely mud, it hath not its
        like for delightfulness in all the world!--we do fairly
        wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship's
        presence."</p>

        <p>"Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious! If that I
        could but clothe me in raiment like to thine, and strip my
        feet, and revel in the mud once, just once, with none to
        rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the
        crown!"</p>

        <p>"And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou
        art clad--just once"--</p>

        <p>"Oho, wouldst like it? Then so shall it be. Doff thy
        rags, and don these splendors, lad! It is a brief
        happiness, but will be not less keen for that. We will have
        it while we may, and change again before any come to
        molest."</p>

        <p>A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was
        garlanded with Tom's fluttering odds and ends, and the
        little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked out in the gaudy
        plumage of royalty. The two went and stood side by side
        before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not
        seem to have been any change made! They stared at each
        other, then at the glass, then at each other again. At last
        the puzzled princeling said,</p>

        <p>"What dost thou make of this?"</p>

        <p>"Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer. It is
        not meet that one of my degree should utter the thing."</p>

        <p>"Then will <i>I</i> utter it. Thou hast the same hair,
        the same eyes, the same voice and manner, the same form and
        stature, the same face and countenance, that I bear. Fared
        we forth naked, there is none could say which was you, and
        which the Prince of Wales. And, now that I am clothed as
        thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more
        nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark
        ye, is not this a bruise upon your hand?"</p>

        <p>"Yes, but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth
        that the poor man-at-arms"--</p>

        <p>"Peace! It was a shameful thing and a cruel!" cried the
        little prince, stamping his bare foot. "If the king--Stir
        not a step still I come again! It is a command!"</p>

        <p>In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article
        of national importance that lay upon a table, and was out
        at the door and flying through the palace grounds in his
        bannered rags, with a hot face and glowing eyes. As soon as
        he reached the great gate, he seized the bars, and tried to
        shake them, shouting.</p>

        <p>"Open! Unbar the gates!"</p>

        <p>The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly, and
        as the prince burst through the portal, half-smothered with
        royal wrath, the soldier fetched him a sounding box on the
        ear that sent him whirling to the roadway, and said,</p>

        <p>"Take that, thou beggar's spawn, for what thou got'st me
        from his highness!</p>

        <p>The crowd roared with laughter. The prince picked
        himself out of the mud, and made fiercely at the sentry,
        shouting,</p>

        <p>"I am the Prince of Wales; my person is sacred; and thou
        shalt hang for laying thy hand upon me!"</p>

        <p>The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and
        said mockingly, "I salute your gracious highness." Then
        angrily, "Be off, thou crazy rubbish!"</p>

        <p>Here the jeering crowd closed around the poor little
        prince, and hustled him far down the road, hooting him, and
        shouting, "Way for his royal Highness! Way for the Prince
        of Wales!"</p>
