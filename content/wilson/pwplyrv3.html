        <p>The unquestionable success of the dramatization of Mark
        Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," by Mr. Frank Mayo, may
        be credited very largely to the individual work as an actor
        of Mr. Mayo himself. That fact should not diminish in any
        way the full meed of praise due him for his work as a
        dramatist as well, for out of a book full of epigrams but
        meagre and diffuse in plot he has constructed a play of
        coherent dramatic interest.</p>

        <p>He has turned conversation into action--not accomplished
        as great a transformation as might be desired, perhaps, but
        still done wonders. It is safe to say that everybody who
        has witnessed the performance at the Herald Square Theatre
        during the past week has been agreeably surprised.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo plays the part of Pudd'n'head, a role that
        dominates the whole story. Mr. Mayo is an old actor, with
        many successes to point back at, from "Davy Crockett" on,
        but in none of them have his artistic abilities shown more
        brightly than they do in the impersonation of the long
        suffering, clear headed, sunny tempered and witty
        "Pudd'n'head Wilson." There is a certain slow smoothness
        and dry humor about his work that is delightful. Even that
        well worn story of wishing to own half of an obnoxious dog,
        so that he could kill his half, sounds fresh and new again
        as he tells it.</p>

        <p>Even the ladies in the audience laughed when he
        said:--"Circumstantial evidence is generally wrong. You see
        a woman sharpen a pencil. You know she did it with a knife.
        If you didn't see her you would be willing to swear she did
        it with her teeth."</p>

        <p>The play is a novelty in that it depicts life in the
        Southwest at an era never before utilized by dramatists.
        The art of the actors and the cleverness of the costumers
        have done much toward making this a strong feature. The
        evils and characteristics of slavery days were perhaps
        never more honestly and justly set forth.</p>
