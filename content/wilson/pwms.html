          <h2>Tom</h2>
        </center>[<i>In the manuscript of</i> Pudd'nhead Wilson<i>,
        in what is now Chapter 10, MT included five paragraphs in
        which Tom, having just learned from Roxy that he is "black"
        and a slave, tries to understand his self on the basis of
        his racial ancestry. MT deleted the passage when he was
        making his last revisions of the manuscript. It reflects
        Tom's own thoughts, confused and inconclusive, not the
        narrator's, but if MT had included it in the novel he would
        have strengthed any case the novel might be making against
        the idea that "blackness" was an inferior racial heredity.
        (The manuscript is in The Morgan Library.)</i>]

        <p>In his broodings in the solitudes, he searched himself
        for the reasons of certain things, &amp; in toil &amp; pain
        he worked out the answers:</p>

        <p>Why was he a coward? It was the "nigger" in him. The
        nigger <i>blood</i>? Yes, the nigger blood degraded from
        original courage to cowardice by decades &amp; generations
        of insult &amp; outrage inflicted in circumstances which
        forbade reprisals, &amp; made mute &amp; meek endurance the
        only refuge &amp; defence.</p>

        <p>Whence came that in him which was high, &amp; whence
        that which was base? That which was high came from either
        blood, &amp; was the monopoly of neither color; but that
        which was base was the <i>white</i> blood in him debased by
        the brutalizing effects of a long-drawn heredity of
        slave-owning, with the habit of abuse which the possession
        of irresponsible power always creates &amp; perpetuates, by
        a law of human nature. So he argued.</p>
