<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson is the attraction at Ford's Grand Opera House. It is produces, with the exception of the title role, by the original company. Theodore Hamilton as Pudd'nhead Wilson gives an admirable portraiture of the dramatist's ideal and recalls the delightful recollections that cluster around the memory of Frank Mayo. Next week, Seabrooke.</p>
