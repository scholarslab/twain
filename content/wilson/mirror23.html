<p>The appearance of Frank Mayo in Pudd'nhead Wilson has been patiently awaited by the patrons of the New Grand, and his opening there to-night was in the nature of an ovation. The house was crowded.</p>

<p>The Walnut Street welcomed Frank Mayo in Pudd'nhead Wilson with an enthusiastic audience. Mark Twain's romantic story has been woven into a play that appeals to the hearts of all. The supporting company was an excellent one. Underlined is Minnie Maddern Fiske.</p>
