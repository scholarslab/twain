<p>Mr. A. M. Sheehan, treasurer of the Tremont theater, wore an expression of supreme satisfaction last evening, for he was taking his annual benefit and the house was crowded by an exceptionally cultured and brilliant audience.</p>
<p>And everybody appeared delighted with "Pudd'nhead Wilson," the popular dramatization of Mark Twain's idyl of southern life in the lazy, peaceful antebellum days.</p>
<p>The memory of the former engagement, billed at the same theater, is still fresh in the public mind, and yet a year and a half has elapsed since that event, and the lamented Frank Mayo, who made one of the greatest successes of his life in the title role, has been dead nearly a year.</p>
<p>It was abundantly demonstrated last night that the play has lost nothing of its power to charm, for, quietly as the story revealed itself, the audience watched its progress with intense and never-flagging interest, and showed a keen and quick appreciation of the quiet yet unctuous humor which pervades most of the characters.</p>
<p>Most conspicuous among the new members of the cast are Theodore Hamilton in the role of Pudd'nhead and Miss Ada Dwyer as Roxy, the slave girl.</p>
<p>The piece does not suffer in the least by the changes. Mr. Hamilton, with his manly, impressive presence, his genial and remarkably mobile face wins and holds every heart whenever he is on the stage, and Miss Dwyer is fully up to the demands of her strongly melodramatic role, her dialect being particularly realistic.</p>
<p>It is thoroughly refreshing to witness a good play with two such sterling old-time actors in the cast as Messrs Hamilton and Aiken, both of whom are products of the old, efficient school, the stock company of from 20 to 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Edwin F. Mayo is admirable as the sheriff, Arnold Daly is strong and forceful as Chambers, the hero lover, Frank Campau [sic] is thoroughly efficient in the part of the villain, and those inimitable characters Judge Robinson, Swan and Campbell kept the audience in good spirits whenever they were visible.</p>
<p>Lucille La Verne as the old-fashioned widow, and Miss Mayo as the sweet southern heroine, Rowy, were both charming and amusing in their quaint, antique hoopskirts and flounces. Indeed, no small part of the delight of the play is due to the picturesque costumes of 50 years ago.</p>
