<p>Grand Opera House Again Closed&ndash;Pudd'nhead Wilson&ndash;Benton's Gossip.</p>

<p>[<i>Special to The Mirror</i>]</p>

<p>There was a large house at the Tremont this evening when Frank Mayo gave Bostonians their first chance to see Pudd'nhead Wilson. Mr. Wilson had not played here for a number of years, and the interest in the new play was unusual. As the star has always been a great favorite and the company contains many who are equal favorites here, a banner engagement is to be expected, judging from the enthusiasm which was manifested this evening.</p>
