<center>"PUDD'NHEAD" AND OTHERS.</center>

<p>In his drawing of <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, Mr. Frank Mayo has added another to our modern collection of American stage portraits. Unlike the characters in "Trilby," <i>Pudd'nhead</i> had not been pictured by the artist as well as described by the author. He had to be brought into physical existence from a previous one in words alone. In dramatizing Mark Twain's book and in creating a stage <i>Pudd'nhead</i>  Mr. Mayo has achieved a marked success. The play could be improved by shortening, but the story is fairly well told and is an interesting one. He makes <i>Pudd'nhead</i> himself a thoroughly gentle, lovable, long-suffering old soul, but with a force of conviction and strength of speech that make the trial scene a most effective one. The support is thoroughly competent, and the piece has been well staged by the management of the Herald Square Theatre.</p>
