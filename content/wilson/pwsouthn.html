            <font size="+1">IN RE "PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."</font>
          </center><br />

          <p>A better title, perhaps, would be "The Decline and
          Fall of Mark Twain;" for, looking at it solely as a piece
          of literature, there is no denying, that his
          much-advertised serial is tremendously stupid. If it were
          nothing more, the reading, even the critical, world could
          afford to receive it in the charity of silence,
          remembering the merry heart it has had these twenty years
          past whenever it pleased Mr. Clemens to amuse it.</p>

          <p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" is more than stupid. So far as it
          has appeared -- to the end of the second installment,
          that is -- it is at once malicious and misleading. So
          much so, indeed, that involuntarily one recalls the
          gentleman who, it was said, "went to his memory for his
          wit, and his imagination for his facts."</p>

          <p>It certainly seems to me that Mr. Clemens must have
          imagined all the local color of his tale. It has to do
          with Dawson's Landing, a small Missouri town on the
          Mississippi, populated largely with F. F. V.'s, all of
          whom are slave-holders, as are the rest of the
          inhabitants. Right here I wish to ask why it is that the
          Southern man who has an honest and decent pride in the
          fact that he comes of good stock fares so ill at the
          hands of certain literary gentlemen? Bret Harte gives us
          Colonel Starbottle as his type. Mr. Cable has won fame
          and fortune and the heart of the whole North by
          demonstrating to its entire satisfaction how heartlessly
          and continually all his well-born gentlemen overstep the
          color line. Last of all, Mark Twain has set himself the
          task of showing how impossible it is for a man to have a
          great-grandfather and, at the same time, any regard for
          the Decalogue.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the gentlemen are bent on gleaning the full
          harvest of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Perhaps, too, they are
          wise in so doing. In my seven years North, I have more
          than once been asked by people who regarded themselves as
          very well informed "if there were still in the South any
          pure blacks at all, or any pure-blooded whites?" At first
          such questioning made me angry. Later, I have come to
          recognize it as the legitimate outcome of the
          deliverances of Mr. Cable and his school. Now that Mark
          Twain has come under their banner, the impression will
          doubtless become more than ever current. For he has --
          and has deserved -- the widest public of any living
          American writer. And it is a melancholy fact that the
          sheep instinct of humanity is so strong as to make it
          follow <i>en masse</i> into any pasture of opinion where
          he may lead. A still more melancholy fact is the
          inability of many folk to judge a thing with eyes blinded
          by the glamour of a great reputation.</p>

          <p>Otherwise, I think, some one would have risen ere this
          to protest against some of Mr. Clemens' gentle
          idiosyncrasies displayed in the first installment. For
          instance, the character of Pembroke Howard, introduced
          solely that the author might tell us that Howard, too,
          was an F. F. V., also that "he was popular with the
          people" -- and that the story has no sort of concern with
          him. A while later he is permitted to die. At least there
          is a line to that effect. What I want to know, and would
          like to ask Mr Clemens, is how a man can be "popular with
          the people," since popular means of, by, or with the
          people. It does assuredly seem to me pretty queer usage
          for a man who was so lately toasted and feted by the
          Lotos Club, as the leading exponent of literary art.</p>

          <p>That is by no means a solitary gem of its kind.
          Careful reading shows the like upon almost every page. It
          is not too much to say, in fact, that there is slovenly
          construction in every other paragraph. But the manner is
          a trifling burden compared with the matter of it. First
          to last, the writer seemed to feel his burden of
          humor-with-malice-aforethought. He had chosen his place,
          his people. If the facts about them are not humorous, so
          much the worse for facts.</p>

          <p>Witness the naming of the hero. He had come out of
          Western New York to practice law in the Missouri town.
          One day, hearing a dog bark, he indulges in the
          Joe-Millerism of wishing he owned half the dog so he
          might make an end of it. Thereupon the bystanders "fell
          away from him as something uncanny, and went into privacy
          to discuss him, One said; "'Pears to be a fool.'</p>

          <p>"'Pears?' said another. '<i>Is</i>, I reckon. Said he
          wished he owned half the dog.'</p>

          <p>"'The idiot,' said a third. 'What did he reckon would
          become of the other half if he killed his half? Do you
          reckon he thought it would live?'</p>

          <p>"'In my opinion he ain't got any mind.'</p>

          <p>"No. 3 said: 'Well, he's a lummox, anyway.'</p>

          <p>"'That's what he is,' said No. 4 'He's a labrick; just
          a Simon pure labrick: if ever there was one.'</p>

          <p>"'Yes, sir, he's a damn fool, that's the way I put him
          up,' said No, 5. 'Any body can think different that wants
          to, but those are my sentiments.'</p>

          <p>"'I am with you gentlemen,' said No. 6. 'Perfect
          jackass -- yes, and it ain't going too far to say he is a
          pudd'nhead. If he ain't a pudd'nhead, I ain't no judge,
          that's all.'</p>

          <p>"Mr. Wilson stood elected. The incident was told all
          over town and gravely discussed by everybody. Within a
          week he had lost his first name. Pudd'nhead took its
          place."</p>

          <p>This is humor, as the great editors understand it. To
          one a little bit conversant with the folk who are
          supposed to be humorous, it seems, contrariwise,
          something cheap and thin. Throughout the Southwest, for
          at least seventy five years, "I'd like to own that dog --
          and kill my half" has been a cant saying so commonly
          current that it is laughed at only out of compliment to
          the user of it. The men who should now perpetrate it as
          original would perhaps be called something worse than a
          "pudd'nhead," but very certainly nobody -- not the most
          ignorant -- would find in it a suggestion of uncanniness.
          For the thing is so common and proverbial that little
          children make use of it, or rather of its implication.
          More than one small lad has told me, rejoicing, "Ma has
          stopped her half of me from going to school." And one
          shrewd young person within my knowledge bought half of a
          coveted dolly, then insisted on a property-right to play
          with it all the time.</p>

          <p>So, too, of Mr. Clemens' young man who went away East
          to college, and came back with "Eastern polish," whatever
          that may be -- perhaps perfect fitting clothes and a
          habit of wearing gloves. His old friends overlooked the
          polish of the clothes, but could not forgive the glove
          habit, so he was left solitary. This is some more,
          doubtless, of Mr. Clemens' very peculiar humor. He ought,
          however, to have stated the fact in a foot note. He might
          have been at the same pains about the reception to the
          Brothers Capollo. His account of the honors thrust upon
          them is doubtless a sly revenge upon the misguided
          Southern communities, which have stretched out admiring
          hands to Mr. Clemens when he would rather they did
          not.</p>

          <p>So much for the accidentals of the tale. To deal
          adequately with the story itself, either in motif or
          atmosphere, would require more time and space than I, at
          present, command. It is built around the exchange of two
          children, born the same day, to one father. One his
          wife's son; the other, his slave's. The wife dies; the
          slave mother, who has sixteen parts of white blood to one
          of black, has sole charge of both babies. After a while,
          her master (as is the custom of Virginia gentlemen in the
          hands of high literary persons), for some biding fault,
          sells all the other house servants, though as a mark of
          magnanimity he sells them at home instead of sending them
          down the river. The life-likeness of this part will be
          apparent to every ex-slave owner, especially to such as
          remember how far beyond rubies was in those days the
          price of a thoroughly excellent servant. Setting wholly
          aside the human affection that often subsisted between
          white and black, few men were so foolish as to
          inconvenience themselves by entire change of
          <i>menage</i>, without the most imperative necessity for
          such a proceeding. All that is, however, beside the mark.
          This sale goes forward, and as a result, Roxy, the white
          slave, puts her son in his half brother's place to save
          him from the possibility of such a fate.</p>

          <p>She also puts her creator -- Mark Twain -- in rather a
          hard dilemma. To his mind the only man worth either
          saving or damning in all the South country is the black
          man. The exigencies of fiction, however, make it
          necessary that the grave baby, who normally would grow up
          a pen-feathered angel, shall, as his own young master,
          grow up a pretty respectable devil. Similarly, the white
          child must be, by the change of position, endowed with
          all the virtue and grace of the subject race. Anybody can
          see that it is hard lines for the writer. One can fancy
          him apologizing beforehand to the little negro for the
          violence he is compelled to do his character. He makes
          the plunge and the double transformation boldly. It is
          more than a little amusing, though, to one who knows
          experimentally the autocracy of a "black mammy," to read
          how Roxy, after the exchange, was surprised to see how
          steadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue
          reverent, her manner humble towards her young master, was
          transferring itself to her speech and manner toward the
          usurper. Roxy must have been a mighty exceptional
          character if she did not spank her charges with natural
          and noble impartiality, whether they were white or
          black.</p>

          <p>She had christened her own child "Valet de Chambre --
          no surname. Slaves hadn't the privilege." That is some
          more news to us who owned them, and who keep lively
          memories of their pride in their surnames; and how
          tenaciously, after freedom came, they clung to the
          appellations whereunto they felt themselves born. In
          founding their families under the new conditions, it was
          often laughable to see the leaning to aristocracy. In
          more than one case within my own knowledge, negroes
          abandoned the names of the living masters, in favor of
          that of the master's grandfather from whom they were
          inherited and to whose family they leaned because of is
          greater distinction. Truly, if they had had no privilege
          of surnames, there must have been confusion worse
          confounded in the era '65.</p>

          <p>Time and patience fail alike in bringing to book all
          such matters here set down. Suffice it to say that, first
          to last, the whole recital is unveracious. If it is meant
          for caricature, the result is the same as would come from
          exaggerating the ear, nose, and coat-tails of a Bowery
          tough, and labelling the picture "Ward McAllister." So
          far as I know, all that the South, either "Old" or "New,"
          has ever done to Mr. Clemens has been to buy his books,
          when it had precious little money to buy anything, and to
          set him upon a pedestal as the very prince of humorists.
          Wherefore, I quite fail to comprehend why it pleases him
          to villify us as he is doing in this book.</p>

          <p>Let me add that I am no bigot in behalf of mine own
          people. Some have foibles, faults galore, even sins of
          deepest dye. There are knaves and fools among them --
          uncouth fellows not a few. So much I readily grant. I
          will go further and admit that there is that in the
          social constitution which, rightly handled, might give a
          humorist scope to add largely to the gaiety of nations.
          But take them by little and large, they are neither
          sordid nor stolid, nor lacking in the finer parts of
          humanity. All this Mr. Clemens makes them out to be. And
          because he is who he is, a large part of our common
          country will take his circus-posters for accurate
          photographs of life and people in the South. Solely for
          that reason, I make, here and now, my protest against
          this injustice. I can not comfort myself with the belief
          that he has sinned ignorantly against half his
          countrymen. His experience has been too wide, his
          intelligence is too keen, for that. He is, it seems to
          me, thus unveracious for revenue only. He has found out
          the sort of book that soils [sells?] best. It is not that
          which speaks the truth as it is, but as the reader wishes
          to believe it to be. Beside, it is only against a
          background so lurid as the one he manufactured that the
          action of his story could possibly take place. As an
          occasional dabbler in fiction, I recognize the strength
          of that necessity. But I can not hold that it is
          sufficient to justify the falsification of all historic
          conditions. A long time ago, I read a speech of Mr.
          Clemens in which he said, at the outset, that he had
          chosen something he knew nothing whatever about so as to
          be quite unhampered by facts. To judge from "Pudd'nhead
          Wilson," he has contracted a habit of being unhampered by
          facts -- a habit which seems to grow stronger with
          age.</p>
