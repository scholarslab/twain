          <p><i>Puddenhead Wilson</i>, Mark Twain's latest story,
          is the work of a novelist, rather than of a "funny man."
          There is plenty of humour in it of the genuine Mark Twain
          brand, but it is as a carefully painted picture of life
          in a Mississippi town in the days of slavery that its
          chief merit lies. In point of construction it is much the
          best story that Mark Twain has written, and of men and
          women in the book at least four are undeniably creations,
          and not one of them is overdrawn or caricatured, as are
          some of the most popular of the author's lay figures.
          There is but one false note in the picture, and that is
          the introduction of the two alleged Italian noblemen.
          These two young men are as little like Italians as they
          are like Apaches. When challenged to fight a duel, one of
          them, having the choice of weapons, chooses revolvers
          instead of swords. This incident alone is sufficient to
          show how little Italian blood there is in Mark Twain's
          Italians. But this is a small blemish, and if Mark Twain,
          in his future novels, can maintain the proportion of only
          two lay figures to four living characters, he will do
          better than most novelists. The extracts from "Puddenhead
          Wilson's Almanac," which are prefixed to each chapter of
          the book, simply "pizon us for more," to use Huck Finn's
          forcible metaphor. Let us hope that a complete edition of
          that unrivalled almanac will be issued at no distant
          day.</p>
