<p>Amphion.&ndash;Pudd'nhead Wilson.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's graphic story, Pudd'nhead Wilson, adapted for stage presentation by Frank Mayo, attracted a large audience to the Amphion on Monday night. The jury scene is one of the most humorous and realistic incidents of the play. Interest centred in the performance of Theodore Hamilton, who was cast for the title role. Mr. Hamilton proved beyond a doubt his ability for the part, and the hearty applause which greeted him was merited. His characterization is faithfully modeled after that of his predecessor. But few changes are noted in the cast. Lucille La Verne continue to win favor and laughs as Patsy, Pudd'nhead's sister. Frank E. Aiken and Frank Currier as York Driscoll and Pembroke respectively give their usual good performance. Eleanor Moretti is a conscientious Roxy, while Frank Champeau proves capable as Tom Driscoll. The Chambers of Arnold Daly is deserving of special mention, being a particularly clever bit of acting. Roland Reed in his new play, The Wrong Mr. Wright, is to follow.</p>
