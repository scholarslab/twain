<p>At the Metropolitan Theatre Pudd'nhead Wilson was presented for the first time in this city Oct. 30 to a fair-sized and delighted audience.  Rarely, if ever, has the first performance of any play upon the local stage been received with such marked demonstrations of approval.  Triple curtain calls marked the close of every act.  Edwin Mayo, Frank Campeau, Ralph Dean, Charles J. Edmunds, Augustus Balfour, and Ada Dwyer contributed largely to the enjoyment of the performance.</p>

<p> . . . The annual benefit of the Minneapolis Press Club was given at the Lyceum Theatre afternoon of 27, before a large and brilliant audience.  The programme, which was replete with clever specialties, included a brief address by Red Blanket and Kay-Gway-ge-Way-be-Nung, representatives from the Chippewa tribe of Indians at Leech Lake, Minn., the scene of the recent disturbance.  Volunteers assisted from the Pudd'nhead Wilson, What Happened to Jones, Muldoon's Picnic, and Dorothy Morton opera companies.  The performance concluded with a series of artistic living pictures.</p>
