<center><b>FRANK MAYO'S TWAIN PIECE. "PUDD'N-HEAD WILSON."</b><br />

          A Play of Considerable Interest, Acted with Much Skill</b></center>

        <p>Mr. Clemens's story of interchanged babies and the man
        who took prints of people's thumbs on bits of glass has
        been made into a play of four acts and a prologue, and at
        the Herald Square Theatre last evening the first
        performance of it took place. The work of dramatization was
        done by Mr. Frank Mayo, and he has accomplished a most
        difficult task with a degree of success that is somewhat
        surprising. The play is not a good one, judged by the
        technical standards, most of which it violates again and
        again, but not a few of its scenes are of undoubted
        interest, and at least one of them is marked by a strength
        of emotion so great that faults of construction can be
        easily forgotten.</p>

        <p>Like all plays made from books, "Pudd'nhead Wilson"
        lacks continuity of action. The incidents selected for
        presentation require and receive much explanation of a kind
        thoroughly undramatic, and, therefore, dull, and yet after
        all many of them are left vague and not easy to understand,
        except by recalling the story in its printed form. This,
        the inevitable consequence of contracting a broad picture
        to the limits of a proscenium arch, constitutes the chief
        weakness of Mr. Mayo's play, and may prevent it from being
        a popular success, but there is at least a probability that
        the piece may be saved by the picturesqueness and reality
        of the types it introduces, by the care and ability with
        which it is acted, and by the curious ingenuity with which
        its denouement is brought about. "Shore Acres" won favor on
        no better ground than "Pudd'nhead Wilson" can offer, and
        for reasons not notably dissimilar.</p>

        <p>The play follows the book with sufficient closeness. In
        the prologue the children are changed, not exactly as Mr.
        Clemens chose to do it, but quite as well. In the first act
        Tom and Chambers are shown as young men, and the villagers
        are talking about the mysterious thefts. The Italian twins
        appear and take lodgings in Wilson's own house. The second
        act brings the confession to Tom by Roxy that she is his
        mother. The third centres in the duel between Judge
        Driscoll and the Italian, and the wounding, not murder, of
        the former by Tom. The trial of the Count and the
        revelation of Tom's identity by the fingermarks made during
        his infancy bring the piece to a close.</p>

        <p>In the title role Mr. Mayo portrayed with a skill, which
        it would be difficult to praise too highly, the gentle
        Pudd'nhead, misjudged by all around him, and patiently
        waiting for recognition and appreciation from the ignorant
        villagers. The part is a delightfully sympathetic one, and
        Mr. Mayo played it with a simplicity and sincerity that
        enabled him to preserve all its humor, while never losing
        the dignity of an underlying seriousness.</p>

        <p>As Chambers, the "white nigger," Mr. Edgar L. Davenport
        did work quite as admirable as that of Mr. Mayo, and quite
        as difficult. Mr. Henley made a terribly realistic Tom
        Driscoll, heartless, cruel, and cowardly. Mr. Harry
        Davenport as the courtly Judge, Mr. Odell Williams as a
        comical, but not impossible, Sheriff, and Mr. Joseph
        Whiting as a lawyer, were all careful studies of character
        and harmonious elements of the pictures presented. The Roxy
        of Miss Mary Shaw was emotionally persuasive, while in the
        interpolated roles of Wilson's niece and sister, Miss
        Frances Graham and Miss Lucille La Verne both won cordial
        applause.</p>

        <p>The minor figures, jurymen, slaves, and the like,
        received more attention than is given to such accessory
        figures in many productions much more pretentious, and this
        fact had not a little to do with making the trial scene one
        of the most effective that has been put on the stage here
        for years.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Mayo appeared last night at the Herald Square
        Theatre before a small audience in the initial production
        of his dramatization of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson."
        The audience seemed to be made up largely of the friends of
        the actor, an observation which applies, in point of time,
        only to the prologue and a portion of the first act. After
        everybody in the house had become the intimate of
        Pudd'nhead, the demonstrations of approval, at first merely
        friendly, became enthusiastic. Mr. Mayo's dramatization has
        preserved the flavor of the author's humor, and a real
        character walks the stage in the person of the client and
        [case starved?] country lawyer, with his shrewd philosophy
        and his contempt for the village blockheads who have made
        him the butt of their bucolic wit.</p>

        <p>The play is sufficiently melodramatic to give Mr. Mayo
        opportunity to employ the methods with which his long
        experience has made him familiar. If anything, it suffers
        from a little too much plot, involving a little too much
        "talky" explication; yet this defect is easily susceptible
        of correction. The action hinges upon an identification by
        means of the thumbmarks of two persons, the scientific
        study of which has been Pudd'nhead's hobby. This
        identification brings his enemies to confusion and the play
        to a triumphant close. One of the most effective situations
        is that at the close of the third act, when the
        investigator believes his cherished theory exploded, its
        effectiveness being gained by its extreme simplicity.
        Wilson's forensic oratory in the last act, also, is
        excellently conceived, having neither too much nor too
        little of the spirit of the backwoods advocate. Mr. Mayo
        was supported by a competent company. Miss Mary Shaw as
        Roxy, the white slave-mother, acted with force and
        generally with good judgment. Mr. Henley was weighted down
        with the part of a very bad villain. Most of the actors
        were remarkably consistent in the use of their Southern
        accents. The play is a refreshing contrast to so much that
        has been produced upon the New York stage this season in
        that it is absolutely decent.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo was obliged to respond to repeated curtain
        calls during the progress of the play, and at its close was
        obliged to speak his acknowledgements. He read the
        following dispatch from Mark Twain: "Cable me the jury's
        verdict." The audience cried in answer: "A success!"</p>

<p>It seems that when Frank Mayo undertook to dramatize Mark Twain's "Puddin'head Wilson" he found that it lacked a love story, and he has accordingly endeavored to supply an amatory interest.</p>
<p>The main idea of the story is the changing of two children in infancy. One, Tom Driscoll, is a slave while the other, Chambers, is of aristocratic lineage. Driscoll has only the smallest trace of negro blood, and is, to all appearances, as white as the other infant. No one is aware of their nativity except the mother of the real slave child.</p>
<p>The latter is educated in keeping with his supposed station. The white child, on the other hand, is reared in utter ignorance. He can neither read nor write, and according to the book he acquires the habit, manners, speech and deportment of the slave. In fact, he is even supposed to be imbued with the meek servility of the Southern negro.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayo, however, presumably for the purpose of enhancing the dramatic quality of the plot, makes the supposed slave more attractive in order to lend probability to the love episode between him and Rowy Mason, the character that Mr. Mayo has evolved from Rowena Cooper of the book.</p>
<p>Chambers and Rowy are playmates, and he becomes her loyal companion. In return she declares her undying faith in him and champions his cause whenever he gets into trouble. Ultimately she becomes aware of his real origin as the heir of the Driscoll name and fortune, and there is no further impediment to their matrimonial union.</p>
<p>The performance was followed with great interest by the audience assembled at the Herald Square Theatre last evening, and it was certainly a successful production from the point of view of a first-night audience. It is probable, therefore, that Mr. Mayo's adroit dramatization will meet with an equally enthusiastic endorsement from succeeding audiences. The piece is at once artistic and entertaining, and there is sufficient plot to sustain the dramatic interest to the final curtain.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayo was delightfully humorous and remarkably effective in his personation of David Wilson, generally known as Puddin'head. Edgar L. Davenport was see to advantage as Chambers, and E. J. Henley offered an exceptionally clever characterization of Tom Driscoll.</p>
<p>Mary Shaw's Roxy was a delineation of great dramatic power. Her dialect and general bearing were thoroughly typical of a passionate woman who, according to Mark Twain, was "to all intents and purposes as white as anybody, but the one-sixteenth of her which was black, out-voted the other fifteen parts, and made her a negro."</p>
<p>Lucille La Verne gave a realistic portrayal of Patsy, Pudd'nhead's sister. Frances Graham was sprightly and captivating as Rowy, while Emma Brennan and Ellena Maris did good work in minor roles. Commendation should also be accorded Henry Davenport, Joseph Whiting, Ignacio Martinetti, Adolph Klauber, Odell Williams, John Ince, W. S. Gill, E. H. Stephens, and W. Hemsley for general efficiency in their respective roles.</p>
<p>The scenery was of a high order of excellence, and the rural scenes were especially admired.</p>

PUDDIN'HEAD WILSON'S WHIMS</b></center>

        <p>No doubt "Puddin'head Wilson" is the play of last week
        that will have the longest life and, in the end, the
        greatest fame. It is not a particularly good play, speaking
        according to rule, for it is absurdly ill made, and full of
        superfluous stuff. Who are the twins, anyway, and why did
        they go to Dawson? They look like a new kind of "song and
        dance team," and doubtless they have meaning and
        identity--but in order to understand them one would be
        compelled to read Mark Twain's very latest story, and that
        is expecting too much of anybody.</p>

        <p>People stopped reading Twain with zest after
        "Huckleberry Finn." That was the last flower of his genius
        in the eye of the public. Of course, to him belongs the
        credit of creating the character of Lawyer Wilson and the
        man who wanted to know what on earth Lawyer Wilson could do
        with half a dog; and what possible legal defense he could
        make after he had killed his half, in the suit for damages
        brought by the owner of the other half, which would surely
        die. Mark Twain's sense of humor is still potent. But after
        merely glancing through his stories of the hustler at the
        Court of King Arthur and the bank-note wager, the multitude
        found that he belonged to a past generation. Everybody has
        read "Trilby" [a competing play playing in New York] and
        everybody else pretends to know all about it; but
        positively nobody, except a few tens of thousands of
        voracious readers of all sorts of fiction, know Mark
        Twain's story of "Puddin'head Wilson." Wherefore an
        elliptical "dramatization" of the story, in the manner of
        John Brougham, was a mistake.</p>

        <p><a name="a">But Mr. Mayo has not</a> measurably improved upon such plays
        as Brougham's "Dombey &amp; Son." He has, to be sure,
        invented a sentimental "element"; but he has not made
        nearly enough of the emotional side of Chambers. A strong
        scene in which that supposititious [sic] darky, thirty-one
        parts Caucasian and one part Ethiopian, should boldly
        declare his passion for Roxy, human nature asserting itself
        in spite of prejudice and environment, would vastly improve
        the play. Chambers is by birth white and aristocratic.
        Following Mark Twain, Mr. Mayo has made the pseudo Thomas a
        Becket a glaring example of the influence of inherited
        traits. He is vicious, because of a training antagonistic
        to his nature, cringing and cowardly. Similarly Chambers,
        on his part, might well develop other traits than courage
        and honesty. The domineering spirit of a race of rulers
        might show itself in him.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo is sometimes too profusely explanatory; at
        others he depends too much on a general knowledge of the
        story of his play. As an after-thought it may be stated, as
        the opinion of one peculiarly gifted in the matter of
        hind-sight, that the prologue in 1836 is quite unnecessary.
        It established the fact that Roxy, an octoroon slave, had
        charge of two children, both by the same father, and of one
        of which she was the mother, and that she sent the wrong
        one to the christening. This could be explained in a few
        words. In the first act the robberies have been discovered,
        and Puddin'head Wilson has his clue, before the twins
        arrive in Dawson. He tells his sister of the darky girl who
        climbed into Tom's room, and the subsequent apparition of
        Tom's face at the window. The arrival of the Italians and
        their installation as boarders at Puddin'head's are later
        incidents of the act. Yet we are solemnly informed
        afterward that the wonderful knife, with a history, was
        stolen from the twins on the night before Puddin'head got
        his clue.</p>

        <p>There are droll moments in the first three acts, and one
        strong scene, before the ruined mill, but nearly all the
        genuine strength and vital interest of the play are
        condensed in the last act, which is admirable. The play
        will probably grow in popularity in its present shape; but
        it would have a still better chance if Mr. Mayo would
        boldly employ a practical playwright to help him make it
        over, dispensing with the prologue and the jesting scene
        about the twins before they have been seen by the
        townspeople; and making the love of Chambers for Rowy a
        stronger element.</p>

        <p>It deserves a chance, for Mr. Mayo's portrayal of
        Puddin'head, the slow-going, sagacious philosopher and
        humorist, is one of the best pieces of character acting we
        have seen in many a day, and the acting of Miss Shaw, Mr.
        Henley, Mr. Edgar Davenport, Mr. Odell Williams, Mr.
        Whiting, Miss Graham, Mr. Harry Davenport, and, for that
        matter, all the others, is uncommonly vivid and
        effective.</p>

<p>The unquestionable success of the dramatization of Mark
        Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," by Mr. Frank Mayo, may
        be credited very largely to the individual work as an actor
        of Mr. Mayo himself. That fact should not diminish in any
        way the full meed of praise due him for his work as a
        dramatist as well, for out of a book full of epigrams but
        meagre and diffuse in plot he has constructed a play of
        coherent dramatic interest.</p>

        <p>He has turned conversation into action--not accomplished
        as great a transformation as might be desired, perhaps, but
        still done wonders. It is safe to say that everybody who
        has witnessed the performance at the Herald Square Theatre
        during the past week has been agreeably surprised.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo plays the part of Pudd'n'head, a role that
        dominates the whole story. Mr. Mayo is an old actor, with
        many successes to point back at, from "Davy Crockett" on,
        but in none of them have his artistic abilities shown more
        brightly than they do in the impersonation of the long
        suffering, clear headed, sunny tempered and witty
        "Pudd'n'head Wilson." There is a certain slow smoothness
        and dry humor about his work that is delightful. Even that
        well worn story of wishing to own half of an obnoxious dog,
        so that he could kill his half, sounds fresh and new again
        as he tells it.</p>

        <p>Even the ladies in the audience laughed when he
        said:--"Circumstantial evidence is generally wrong. You see
        a woman sharpen a pencil. You know she did it with a knife.
        If you didn't see her you would</a> be willing to swear she did
        it with her teeth."</p>

        <p>The play is a novelty in that it depicts life in the
        Southwest at an era never before utilized by dramatists.
        The art of the actors and the cleverness of the costumers
        have done much toward making this a strong feature. The
        evils and characteristics of slavery days were perhaps
        never more honestly and justly set forth.</p>

<center><b>TWAIN AT THE THEATRE.</b></center>

<p>Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens) occupied a box at the Herald Square Theatre on Saturday night, when he first saw Pudd'nhead Wilson, Frank Mayo's play dramatized from his story of that name.</p>
<p>Twain was recognized by several in the audience, and demands were made for a speech. The author finally stepped to the stage and apologized for his lack of preparation, on the ground that he had been "hemmed in all day by W. D. Howells and other frivolous persons."</p>
<p>"I will only say," he added, "that I congratulate Mr. Mayo. He has certainly made a beautiful play out of my rubbish. His is a charming gift. Confidentially, I have always had an idea that I was well equipped to write plays, but I have never encountered a manager who agreed with me."</p>
<p>Mr. Mayo was called before the curtain, but with the words, "I am too wise to make a speech," he darted from view.</p>
