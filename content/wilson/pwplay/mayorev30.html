<center><b>GRAND OPERA HOUSE.<br />
"Pudd'nhead Wilson" Draws and Pleases a Large Audience.</b></center>
<p>Patrons of the theater who visited the Grand opera house Thursday evening had the pleasure of seeing "Pudd'nhead Wilson," one of the very best things of the present season.  The play is a dramatization of Mark Twain's famous story.  The work of the dramatist, Mr. Frank Mayo, now deceased, is wonderfully well done.  Mr. Theo Hamilton's presentation of David Wilson, the central figure in the drama, was well performed.  He is an actor of the old school.  Humorous without being undignified and rising to the importance of grave situations with force and intelligence.  He was especially fine in the scene where he discovers the identity of the would-be murderer.  His denunciation of the culprit in the closing scene was thrilling in the extreme and productive of prolonged applause.  Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., assumed the character of Chambers, the white boy, whose manhood, gallantry and courage, could not be dimmed by the degrading surroundings and associations of the slavery to which the machinations of an enemy had consigned him.  Joseph, Jr., is the son and namesake of the illustrious Jefferson, who as Rip Van Winkle has made his name a household word in two continents.  The young man gives promise of being a chip off the old block.</p>

<p>The New Orleans Times-Democrat says this is perhaps the only play that has been presented which in dealing with the question of negro character has not done more or less violence to the traditions and sentiments of Southern people.  As a matter of fact, while an interesting story has been made to hinge upon the question of a taint of negro blood, this slight taint is made to cause the heir to a rich estate, who has had all the advantages of costly education and luxurious surroundings, to become a thief, a would-be murderer, and to kidnap and sell his free mother into slavery to pay a heavy gambling debt which he had contracted, while his foster brother, of pure white origin, grows up to be a brave, gallant and noble man, despite the fact that he has been brought up a slave.</p>

<p>Hoyt's "A Trip to Chinatown," will be the next attraction on January 27th.</p>
