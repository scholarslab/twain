<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" invaded the Lyceum Theater last night fresh from former triumphs wherever the play has been presented, and so exceptionally large was the attendance at this playhouse that long prior to the rising of the curtain on the first act the manager was justified in instituting a search for the S. R. O. sign.  In these days of cynicism, patrons of theaters are fastidious to a remarkable degree, greatly owing to the diversity of opinion rather than to the merits of a play.  Seldom is it recorded that judgment is universal anent the merits of any play, for styles that suit some do not suit others, and vice versa.  Probably in no city in the United States will a play be accorded closer attention and judged more strictly on its merits as a production than in Memphis, and it is an indisputable fact that the consensus of opinion of intelligent Memphians who attended the Lyceum last night accords "Pudd'nhead Wilson" a top notch in the roll of the plays seen here this season.  Theodore Hamilton is cast in the title role, and the play is presented in a prologue and four acts by a carefully selected company of players.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is produced with all the elaborate setting and investures as at the Herald Square Theater, New York.  As David Wilson, or "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which sobriquet he acquired but did not appreciate, Theodore Hamilton has a role peculiarly adapted to his ability.  His intontation of voice renders the droll, quaint utterances characteristic of the part he enacts most effective, and his delineation is in every respect remarkably drawn.  Previous to the trial scene in the last act, up to which time the banterings and jokes of his fellow townspeople find in him a target, the character is one of repression.  However, when opportunity offers itself, Mr. Hamilton demonstrated the fact that fire, force and vigor could be portrayed by him equally as well as the lawyer whose career was not suffused with brilliant achievements and who consequently felt under restraint.  E. A. Locke shared the honors of the evening with Mr. Hamilton.  His personation of the country sheriff provoked laughter and applause during his entire presence before the audience, and especially in the courtroom scene.  Miss Margaret Hayward was easily adequate to her assignment, although she was afforded no flattering opportunities wherein to demonstrate her true work.  Joseph Jefferson, Jr., as the slave, gave a commendable interpretation of that individual, his accent and dialect being especially good.  John Tucker, who was assigned the unenviable part of the villain, was very effective.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" closes its engagement in Memphis Wednesday night, and the usual Wednesday matinee will be given.</p>

<p>Another crowded house greeted "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the Lyceum Theater last night, and thoroughly enjoyed the excellent performance given by the company presenting it.  The engagement will be brought to a close with two performances today.  The splendid acting of Pudd'nhead and the work of the sheriff are gems of good acting.</p>
