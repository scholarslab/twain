<p>It seems that when Frank Mayo undertook to dramatize Mark Twain's "Puddin'head Wilson" he found that it lacked a love story, and he has accordingly endeavored to supply an amatory interest.</p>
<p>The main idea of the story is the changing of two children in infancy. One, Tom Driscoll, is a slave while the other, Chambers, is of aristocratic lineage. Driscoll has only the smallest trace of negro blood, and is, to all appearances, as white as the other infant. No one is aware of their nativity except the mother of the real slave child.</p>
<p>The latter is educated in keeping with his supposed station. The white child, on the other hand, is reared in utter ignorance. He can neither read nor write, and according to the book he acquires the habit, manners, speech and deportment of the slave. In fact, he is even supposed to be imbued with the meek servility of the Southern negro.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayo, however, presumably for the purpose of enhancing the dramatic quality of the plot, makes the supposed slave more attractive in order to lend probability to the love episode between him and Rowy Mason, the character that Mr. Mayo has evolved from Rowena Cooper of the book.</p>
<p>Chambers and Rowy are playmates, and he becomes her loyal companion. In return she declares her undying faith in him and champions his cause whenever he gets into trouble. Ultimately she becomes aware of his real origin as the heir of the Driscoll name and fortune, and there is no further impediment to their matrimonial union.</p>
<p>The performance was followed with great interest by the audience assembled at the Herald Square Theatre last evening, and it was certainly a successful production from the point of view of a first-night audience. It is probable, therefore, that Mr. Mayo's adroit dramatization will meet with an equally enthusiastic endorsement from succeeding audiences. The piece is at once artistic and entertaining, and there is sufficient plot to sustain the dramatic interest to the final curtain.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayo was delightfully humorous and remarkably effective in his personation of David Wilson, generally known as Puddin'head. Edgar L. Davenport was see to advantage as Chambers, and E. J. Henley offered an exceptionally clever characterization of Tom Driscoll.</p>
<p>Mary Shaw's Roxy was a delineation of great dramatic power. Her dialect and general bearing were thoroughly typical of a passionate woman who, according to Mark Twain, was "to all intents and purposes as white as anybody, but the one-sixteenth of her which was black, out-voted the other fifteen parts, and made her a negro."</p>
<p>Lucille La Verne gave a realistic portrayal of Patsy, Pudd'nhead's sister. Frances Graham was sprightly and captivating as Rowy, while Emma Brennan and Ellena Maris did good work in minor roles. Commendation should also be accorded Henry Davenport, Joseph Whiting, Ignacio Martinetti, Adolph Klauber, Odell Williams, John Ince, W. S. Gill, E. H. Stephens, and W. Hemsley for general efficiency in their respective roles.</p>
<p>The scenery was of a high order of excellence, and the rural scenes were especially admired.</p>
