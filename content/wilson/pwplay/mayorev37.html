"Pudd'nhead Wilson" Plays to a Packed House at the Marquam.</b></center>

<p>In "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which was presented at the Marquam last night to an audience which packed the theater in every part, the central figure is Roxey, the slave.  Like many other dramatized stories, this work of Mark Twain lacks continuity.  There are too many characters in it who have too little to do.  The plot unfolds slowly, and at times when the situations demand strong, quick movement, elaboration of theme is introduced involving quietness almost akin to silence.  It is an uneven play, but one of intense human interest; hence its charm and its strong hold on the people.</p>

<p>Edwin Mayo played the title role.  He is a good actor; handsome, with very expressive eyes, which he uses with fine effect, easy and graceful.  All the quiet scenes give him opportunity for light and shade, which he employs with admirable delicacy.  In the court scene, one looks for more force than Mr. Mayo gives to the country lawyer winning his first case.  The audience took kindly to the new star, gave him abundant applause, and called him several times to the footlights.  Comparison of the son with his father, who created the role of Pudd'nhead WIlson, is omitted for the reason that the writer never saw the elder Mayo in Twain's play.</p>
<p>Miss Ada Dwyer played Roxey very well indeed.  She needs only to acquire more of the soft Southern accent to make hers a star part.  All the supporting company are excellent.  There isn't a weak spot in the cast.  Ralph Dean, who played Chambers, has much force, and establishes himself a favorite.  Frank Campau's Tom Driscoll was a clean-cut, consistent, strong bit of work.  The sheriff, the three wise man of Dawson, the twins, Rowey, and Aunt Patsy were all that could be desired.</p>
<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" will be given tonight for the last time.  "Standing room only" was hung out early yesterday afternoon.  The sign will probably be employed again tonight.</p>
