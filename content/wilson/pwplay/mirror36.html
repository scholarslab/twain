<p>If appearances went for anything the death of Frank Mayo has not destroyed the commercial value of Mark Twain's play as a theatrical property. Theodore Hamilton's enactment of the title-role, while necessarily more or less like Mr. Mayo's original portrayal of it, is by no means a slavish copy, but decidedly on new lines in various places, and frequently not without some betterment according to the impressions of many. Business at the Park has been excellent throughout the week, and there is no question but that a return engagement could be played to a profit. Roland Reed, who counts hosts of friends among theatregoers, will follow in The Wrong Mr. Wright.</p>
