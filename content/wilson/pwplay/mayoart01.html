<font size="-1">Veteran Actor Talks Interestingly of His Life in the South Before the War.</font></b></center>

<p>Mr. Theodore Hamilton, who closed his season last night with the "Pudd'nhead Wilson" company, which has been at the Lyceum for the past two days, is well acquainted with Atlanta as it was before the war.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton is a veteran actor with a wide reputation, which has been considerably added to since his present tour with the "Pudd'nhead Wilson" company.  Mr. Hamilton is a southerner, and is a gentleman of the old school.  The play in which he now takes the leading role, very naturally appeals strongly to him, since he remembers the situation in the south at the period of the play.</p>
<p>The scene and characters are also familiar, and the fact that he takes the part of Pudd'nhead Wilson is such an inimitable manner is because, in addition to his natural genius, he has been thrown in contact with just such characters and thoroughly understands them.</p>
<p>Many years ago, before the famous march of Sherman had been thought of, Mr. Hamilton was an actor.  In his tours he often passed through Atlanta, and he became well acquainted with this city.  He has many friends here and they, like himself, are those who knew and lived in the old south.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton played at the old theater which was located about where the Imperial now stands.  The people who applauded him were quite different from the audiences who now greet him in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Off the stage Mr. Hamilton is a jolly southern gentleman.  He is an unusually pleasant man to meet, and his reminiscences are interesting.  On the stage he is still Theodore Hamilton; there is no other like him.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hamilton says he always liked to visit Atlanta.  He has a fondness for it, he says, and has been pleased at its great and wonderful growth.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Thompson was well acquainted with Mr. Hamilton when they were both young men.  He says Mr. Hamilton was at that time one of the handsomest men he ever saw.  This remains one of the most notable features.</p>

<p>Colonel George W. Adair, who saw Mr. Hamilton play in Atlanta before and just after the war, was at the matinee yesterday.  The play brought back to him the scenes with which he was familiar in his younger days.  It reminded him of the old south he had known.</p>

<p>When the war came Mr. Hamilton shouldered his musket with the rest of the confederates, and went to the front.  He was in the Eighth Virginia regiment infantry, and did four years' service for his country.  During his engagement in Atlanta a number of confederate veterans were present to see one of their comrades act.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton, together with the company which supports him, will leave today at noon for Washington, where they will join Mr. Jefferson.</p>

<p>The company playing "Pudd'nhead Wilson," in which Theodore Hamilton was playing the part of David Wilson, has been disbanded and Mr. Hamilton, generally regarded as the finest looking old man on stage today, is to go with Joseph Jefferson on his spring tour, which soon opens in Buffalo (where the man in the song desired so much to be put off).</p>
