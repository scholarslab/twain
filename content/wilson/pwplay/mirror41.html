        <p>Managers May and Jefferson, at McVicker's, have had prepared a supply of glasses such as are used in Mark Twain's play, which they will cause to be distributed as "Pudd'nhead" souvenirs to the women who are in attendance at the Christmas matin&eacute;e on Friday.  On these thumb glasses any one who is curious to become familiar with the beautiful pattern nature has place upon the ball of the thumb of every human being can be satisfied, and they will find that "Pudd'nhead" tells the truth when he says, "And the wonder of it is there are no two in the world alike.</p>

        <p>Mr. Sothern will be with us in "An Enemy to the King," which is doing excellent business at Hooley's, while Mr. Hamilton will play "Pudd'nhead Wilson" for another week at McVicker's.  It would be hard to praise too highly Mr. Hamilton's beautiful acting as the much-laughed-at but finally victorious lawyer, though it must be confessed that the play has little else to recommend it except this one fine character.  The plot rests upon the flimsiest kind of device, the story is of the sickly, sentimental order which may pass in a book, but jars terribly on the stage, and, finally, the dialogue is entirely wanting in that humor which we have always associated with the name of Mark Twain.  Still, if the plot is almost impossible, it is admirably constructed, and the interest is kept up until the very end; besides, it is worth while sitting through the play, if only to see Mr. Hamilton act the part of Pudd'nhead.</p>

<p>Theodore Hamilton has scored a decided success in Frank Mayo's part in Pudd'nhead Wilson, which enters upon its second and last week at McVicker's to-night. On the opening Sunday night Mr. Jefferson occupied a box, and he wrote Mr. Hamilton one of the most genuine letters of congratulation I have ever read. It would take a large sum of money to purchase that letter from Mr. Hamilton. On the whole, the performance is an excellent one.</p>
