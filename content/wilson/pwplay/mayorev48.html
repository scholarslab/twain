"Pudd'nhead Wilson" Well Presented by Mr. Davenport and His Associates.</b></center>

<p>Last evening's production of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" was a distinct triumph.  We trust the patrons of the theatre duly appreciate the enterprise which opeated to secure this high-class novelty for their entertainment.  It was given with a cast, including several members of the original company, which was admirably well-balanced and capable, and the resultant performance moved with scarcely a hitch, the quaint atmosphere, one of the greatest charms of the play, being preserved all through.  Each character stood out clearly in its assigned place, a painstaking effort being displayed at all times upon the part of all to conform to the true meaning of the author, and contribute to a successful tout ensemble.  All of us have either read the book or seen Frank Mayo's adaptation of it for the stage.  The latter is a masterpiece.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayo's son, Edwin F. Mayo, assumed the title role last evening.  For a faithful impersonation of the character made dear to theatre-goers by his father, Mr. Mayo deserves high praise and hearty congratulation.  No reasonable fault could be found with his performance last evening, except that on two occasions he was forced to accept the services of a prompter--a defect which will disappear after he has brushed up a bit on his lines.  For the rest, both his reading and his acting breathed that quaintness and quiet strength of Twain's character, which will make it one of the immortals of the stage.  The cast of the play is a long one, and it is impossible to give extended credit to all the capable performers, but it is necessary that the vigorous work of Miss Mary Shaw as Roxy be appreciatively noticed, as well as Harry Davenport's delightful Judge Driscoll, Mr. Edgar Davenport's Chambers and Miss Frances Graham's Rowy.  The three latter artists assumed these roles in the original production.  Mr. Davenport's Driscoll shows him at his best in elderly roles, and his talented brother's Chambers is remarkable for the vigor and spirit which he infuses into a part which offers little to any actor.  Miss Graham's Rowy is a most delicious piece of work--a gem given a setting which exhibits all its beauty to perfection.  Mr. Holt's Sheriff Blake likewise merits praise for faithful and broadly humorous characterization, and Mr. Balfour's Pembroke deserves a line of credit.  Mr. Barbier as Tom Driscoll, Mr. Everham as Major Swain, Messrs. Middleton and Hummel as the Italian twins, and Miss Maddern as Patsy. complete the group of essential characters, whose efforts all contributed in no small part to the success of the performance.  The play was beautifully staged, and a very appreciative audience was alternately amused and touched by the succession of striking scenes with which it abounds.</p>
