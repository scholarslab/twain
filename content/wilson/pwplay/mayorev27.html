"Pudd'nhead Wilson" a Success</b></center>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson."--Several years ago there was a theory that the thumb print is a mark of individuality more decided than an autograph.  Now, this is a well established fact, but before the public in general were convinced, Samuel L. Clemens wrote a story which he called "Pudd'nhead Wilson."  The foundation on which this story was built was the fact above mentioned.</p>

<p>The story has since been dramatized but the tone and color of it has been left intact, so that "Pudd'nhead Wilson" as a play is as convincing, as entertaining, as clever as when it left the pen of Mark Twain.  It deals of the mixing up of babies, one by law and custom a negro, being but thirty-one parts white, and the other being all Anglo-Saxon, at a christening and the final arighting of the error because of the hobby of Wilson with reference to the distinguishing characteristics of the thumb marks of the babies at different stages of their life.</p>

<p>The play was presented at the Academy last night to an appreciative audience.  Mr. Theo Hamilton assumed the name-role and proved himself to be an artist in every sense of the word.  This character was created by the late lamented Frank Mayo, but notwithstanding the reputation made by the dead actor in the creation, Mr. Hamilton need not fear comparison.  Supporting the star are principally Jos. Jefferson, Jr., and Margaret Hayward, who do clever work.  The other characters are fairly well taken with the exception of Tom Driscoll.  In this role Mr. Lucker does not fulfill the requirements and this is noticeably true to theatre-goers who have seen "Ted" Henley in the same.

<p>"PUDD'N'HEAD WILSON."--Perhaps no more interesting story has ever been told over the footlights than that of "Pudd'n'head Wilson," and the quaint manner in which it was done at the Academy of Music last evening was full of interest.  The play is a prologue and four acts, and the company which presented it is made up of exceedingly clever people, at the head of which is Theodore Hamilton, who appeared in the title role.  The story is one of Mark Twain's best and it would seem that the author had Mr. Hamilton in his mind's eye when he drew the character of "Pudd'n'head," so well does he fill the bill.  But then there were others who helped along the performance, viz. Miss Margaret Haywood as Roxy; Miss Belle Stokes as Rowy, and Joseph Jefferson, Jr., as Chambers, John Lockler as Tom Driscoll, and E. A. Locke as the sheriff.  In fact the entire company was well cast and gave a most successful performance.</p>
