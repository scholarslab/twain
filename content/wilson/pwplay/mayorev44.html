        <center><b>"PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."<br />
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY MATINEE.</b></center>

<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson which will be presented at the Academy tonight by Mr. Theodore Hamilton and a strong company, has held its own as one of the best plays made from contemporary novels.  A large proportion of the theatre goers of this city are also readers of magazines, and no doubt are familiar with Mark Twain's clever novel, and there should be a strong desire to witness the dramatization of his work.  The play follows the outline of the story and condenses it into a prologue and four acts. Mr. Hamilton, who assumes the title role in Pudd'nhead Wilson is better known in the Southern than in the Northern states, although he has been associated nearly all his life with the most prominent actors.  The following notice is from the New Orleans Picayune of January 10, 1898:</p>

<p>Frank Mayo's excellent dramatization of Mark Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," was presented last night at the Grand Opera House.  Mr. Theo. Hamilton, a player of the old school, appeared in the title role.  A good audience was present, and followed with interest the interesting incidents of the piece.  It is a pleasing study of a lovable personality and contains much simple wisdom, especially about thumb-marks and their value as evidence in law.  The plot follows very closely that of the novel, and while this is advantageous in the main, there are places where it conflicts with the requirements of first-rate stage craft.  Mr. Hamilton's assumption of this part was in every respect satisfactory.  He has the advantage of a physique especially well suited to the part.  His deep, rich voice drops easily and naturally into the low tone of Wilson's self-communings, as [sic], as in the trial scene, peals forth with electrifying sonorousness.  Mr. Hamilton was especially fine in the scene where he discovers the identity of the would-be murderer.  For several minutes he does not speak, but his expressive face, bending over the tell-tale pieces of glass, with their precious markings, fully informs the audience what ideas were passing in his mind.  His speech in the last act was really thrilling, and the final denunciation of the real culprit elicited loud applause.  Mr. Hamilton's support is good.  Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr.'s, rendition of the part of Chambers being especially worthy of mention.</p>

        <center><b>THE MOBILE THEATRE.<br />
"PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."</b></center>

<p>The dramatization of Mark Twain's story of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" was presented at the Mobile Theatre last night before an audience of fair size.  The theme of the story is not a pleasant one, but it was presented so well that the audience gave marked evidence of its approval, as the situations, humorous at times and at others almost tragic, developed one after another.  As "Pudd'nhead" Mr. Theodore Hamilton left an impression so pleasing that none who saw him last night could but wish to see him again in a comedy more acceptable to Southern ears.  His manner at all times is most genial and his bearing is that of an actor who is well versed in legitimate comedy work.</p>

<p>The company is a large one and contains quite a number of people who show their capability of arousing the audience to a pitch of good humor.  The scenes are laid in a Southern country village, the leading characters of which are introduced to the audience.  There is no apparent effort on the part of the author to caricature Southern social life, consequently there is no good reason why "Sheriff Blake" should remain in a country lady's best parlor and in the presence of the ladies of the house, with his hat on; nor is there any excuse for "Chambers," the supposed octoroon boy slave, to demean himself in the presence of his young mistress as if he were her social equal.  These are criticisms of minor matters perhaps, but small faults such as these detract and mar some of the best features of the play.</p>

<p>The entire performance was well presented with the company's own scenery, which was much enjoyed.  The comedy itself grows as it proceeds, until the audience anxiously awaits to see the curtain go up on the last acts.  It is in these that all of the characters are seen at their best and the last curtain goes down upon a scene which leaves every one in the best of humor with the comedy and with the people who presented it.</p>

<p>The company will reappear to-day at a matinee performance and again to-night, giving "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at each performance.</p>
