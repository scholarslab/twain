        <p>Frank Mayo's clever adaptation of Mark Twain's story entitled "Puddin'head Wilson" seems to have hit the fancy of the public. It attracted large audiences to the Broad Street Theatre all last week, and promises to be no less successful during the remainder of the engagement, which closes on Saturday evening. It is a good, wholesome, interesting play, containing much that is original and nothing that is objectionable, and it has the great advantage of being particularly well done. Mr. Mayo's impersonation of the pudd'n-headed person is extremely vital, humorous and sympathetic, and all the members of the supporting company do excellent work.</p>

<p>The opening night of last week promised well for the attractions playing here, but the hot spell that followed greatly reduced receipts, and some of our theatres played to empty benches. All our theatres are open, but our fashionable element is still out of town, and the season will not be fairly opened until Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Frank Mayo and his excellent company are in their second and last week at the Broad Street Theatre, and Pudd'nhead Wilson has made an emphatic success in this city. . . .</p>
<p>In Old Kentucky opened to night at the Chestnut Street Theatre for a two weeks' term, with prospects of large patronage. Creston Clarke follows Sept. 30.</p>
