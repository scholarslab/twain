<p>A house completely filled saw "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the Theatre last night, and one might say that it was an Ada Dwyer night. A prolonged reception greeted her first appearance, and gorgeous floral offerings went over the footlights all during the performance.</p>
<p>As the play progressed, what was at first the demonstration of her friends, grew to be a recognition of her art. One can understand that she stood for Frank Mayo's conception of the part, for she is Roxy--the living, breathing Roxy, not a counterfeit or an assumption for the hour.</p>
<p>Miss Dwyer's performance can stand with the best creations in this country, for it is a true one, to the smallest detail, and a scrutiny of details is the severest test.</p>
<p>When Edwin Mayo makes his entrance as Pudd'nhead, one wonders for a moment whether it is not a dream that Frank Mayo is dead. The son is so amazingly like his father in appearance as to seem perfectly natural to those who saw his father in the part. And in the acting Mr. Mayo is also wonderfully close to his father's delineation--he can receive no higher compliment, I take it. It is to be regretted that Mr. Mayo is at present suffering from a cold, which has somewhat impaired his voice. In his portrayal of the character he is completely satisfying.</p>
<p>Frank Campeau, who originated the part of Tom Driscoll, gives a representation of the cowardly Tom which has been perfected to the smallest detail--his walk, his gestures, are all studied to express the perfect villain.</p>
<p>This tale of endless good may begin to seem monotonous, but it was, in truth, a performance of rare excellence which we saw at the Theatre last night. Miss Delero as Patsy looked like a picture, and did well, and Miss Seymour was an acceptable Rowy, although a trifle sober.</p>
<p>A word should be said for the sheriff Blake of Mr. W. R. McKey--a delightful bit of character acting, with a make-up like a picture from the book.</p>
<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" remains with us tonight and tomorrow night, and is one of the season's treats.</p>

The performance is an ideal one, and held the audiences spellbound until an unusually late hour.  Ada Dwyer Russell received almost an ovation, and was deluged with flowers.</p>
