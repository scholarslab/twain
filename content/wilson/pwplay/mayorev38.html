<p>When "Pudd'nhead Wilson," Mark Twain's story dramatized by Frank Mayo, was given in Bangor early in the season we had occasion, in the criticism the following morning, to tap our store of laudatory adjectives in referring to the excellence of the play and the iron-clad strength of the company.  After attending the performance of the second engagement of the season at the Opera House last night we assert without fear of contradiction that it was even better than the first, in that more attention  was given to the scenic adjuncts.  The audience was a large one and that it was enthusiastic as well will be readily understood from the fact that each act, except the last, ended with a double curtain call.</p>

<p>The dramatic strength of the plot, unique and unchanged in its conception, the dry mannerisms, crisp humor and delicate wit were interpreted by the same company which was here at the first of the season in a remarkably forceful and strikingly realistic manner by a well balanced and most  effective company, from the star to the most minor role.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwin Mayo gave to the role of "David," "Pudd'nhead Wilson," the same delightful sympathy that marked his former portrayal and the previous pronounced success of every member of the cast were repeated last night.</p>

<p>The concluding performance tonight deserves another large audience.</p>
