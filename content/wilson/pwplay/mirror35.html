Park.--Pudd'nhead Wilson</b></center>

<p>A large and discriminating audience was gathered here last night, on the qui vive to note the difference of conception and enactment, if any, between the late Mr. Mayo's portrayal of the title-role and its present illustration by Theodore Hamilton. When it is stated that the latter acquitted himself with credit and received earnest and prolonged applause, in many instances from lamented Frank Mayo's most faithful and loyal admirers, the verdict may safely be considered as satisfactory and conclusive. The play is one of such sterling worth, that interest in its telling is not dependent upon the especial merit to be found in any particular character, and when it is known that the cast as a body is practically the same as seen in Mr. Mayo's lifetime, and still includes Frank Campeau, Eleanor Morretti, Newton Chisnell, Lucille La Verne, Frank E. Aiken and Frances Grahame, the performance as a whole may be classed as quite perfect. Roland Reed as The Wrong Mr. Wright is Messrs. Palmer and Knowles's Thanksgiving week attraction.</p>

<p>If appearances went for anything the death of Frank Mayo has not destroyed the commercial value of Mark Twain's play as a theatrical property. Theodore Hamilton's enactment of the title-role, while necessarily more or less like Mr. Mayo's original portrayal of it, is by no means a slavish copy, but decidedly on new lines in various places, and frequently not without some betterment according to the impressions of many. Business at the Park has been excellent throughout the week, and there is no question but that a return engagement could be played to a profit. Roland Reed, who counts hosts of friends among theatregoers, will follow in The Wrong Mr. Wright.</p>
