<p>Frank Mayo's dramatization of Mark Twain's well-known story, which was originally produced at this house last Spring, returned to the scene of its former success for a two weeks' engagement last evening.</p>
<p>Frank Mayo's work in the title-role is as careful and studied as his work as adapter. His Pudd'nhead realizes perfectly the character so amusingly sketched by Mark Twain--quiet, droll, and convincing.</p>
<p>There have been several changes in the cast since the play was first seen here.</p>
<p>Eleanor Moretti was picturesque and dramatic but affected as Roxy. Frank Campeau was fairly good as Tom Driscoll; Arnold Daly played Chambers acceptably. Adolph Klauber and George Hallton were amusing as the twins. Lucille La Verne played Patsy with intelligence and charm. Frances Grahame was a beautiful Roxy. Others in the cast were competent. The scenery was excellent and the audience was large. Heart of Maryland Oct. 21.</p>
