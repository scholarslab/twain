<p>PUDD'NHEAD WILSON TO BE SOLD</p>

<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson, the play which the late Frank Mayo adapted from Mark Twain's story, is to be sold at auction on Sept. 1. After Mayo's death, his son, Edwin F. Mayo, informed Charles E. Evans, who owns a half interest in the play, that he was desirous of succeeding his father in the title role. Mr. Evans, on the contrary, wished to send the play out with Odell Williams in the part. Negotiations then came to a stand-still and the company engaged to support Mr. Williams were released. All the original scenery, as well as the right to produce the play will be sold on Sept. 1.</p>
