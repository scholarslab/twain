<p>Frank Shipman, for many years the business manager of Mr. Joseph Jefferson, is directing the tour of Mr. Theodore Hamilton in Mark Twain's dramatized story, "Pudd'nhead Wilson."  Mr. Hamilton, too, has been with Mr. Jefferson for several seasons, but as that veteran of the stage only plays ten weeks in the early fall and a few weeks in the late spring, Mr. Hamilton secured Twain's idylic story of the quaint and quiet Missourian and is making his first tour of the south with it.  In the company supporting Mr. Hamilton is Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., a real "chip of the old block," who for the first time assumes his own name, having always played under that of Joseph Warren, his middle name.  Young Joe, familiarly called so by his associates, will, if all signs fail not, create a stir in the annals of the stage in his time as does the distinguished father now.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" will hold the boards here Thursday night, and all who have read Twain's story should go and renew their acquaintance with the philosophic Dave, and those who have not can do no better than secure an introduction and sit down to listen to a reading of extracts from "Pudd'nhead's" diary.</p>

<p>That eminent character-actor Theodore Hamilton will play an engagement here Friday night in Frank Mayo's dramatization of Mark Twain's remarkable and successful characterization of this interesting play of American life, "Pudd'nhead Wilson."  To witness a production of this interest play [sic] can hardly fail to be productive of much good.  It is something more than a night's entertainment, something more than a mere series of stage pictures set forth by a master in stage art for the public's pleasure.  It is really a living inspiration of one of the many phases of character that help to make this country great.  In this ideal the author has embodied many ideas whereupon many future plays will be founded and has succeeded in giving to the American stage a play that for its wholesomeness and purity cannot be excelled, a play that shows every manifestation of growing in strength, by its simple theme and harmonious acting, and we are told, is remarkable for its finish, its fineness, its repressed and suggested feelings than for its whirlwind of passionate emotions.  Mr. Hamilton has staged the play with a completeness of detail that aids materially in enhancing its production, and has selected the cast from among the best artists on the boards, chief among his associates being young Joseph Jefferson, son of America's most celebrated comedian.</p>

<p>Of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which comes to the Capital Friday night, the New Orleans Daily Item says: An admirable play, well acted, is "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which was repeated again to an appreciative audience at the Grand Opera House last night, with Theodore Hamilton in the title role.  The attention to detail, the excellent cast, and the appropriate scenery and costumes make this a notable production.  It is a treat to see so many legitimate, old time actors--real actors--as are in the cast of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," aside from Theodore Hamilton, the star, who has played in New Orleans many times before, and who was actor and manager here during the season that John E. Owens directed the fortunes of the Grand Opera House for La Varietie Association.  John E. Ince, of the cast, was a popular "Our Boarding School" star here years ago, and has played Chinamen here with as much favor as was ever granted to Chas. T. Parsloe, for similar work.  Mr. Ed. A. Locke, in the cast, brings back memories of the days when he was a dashing young comedian for Lotta, in the long ago.  There is in the cast also a chip of the old block which is sound yet, young Joseph Jefferson, Jr.  The company is a good one.  It is managed by Master Frank Chapman, whose ancestors brought the English drama to river towns in the south, when they traveled by flatboats before steam turned paddle-wheels in this part of the country.</p>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" will be the attraction at the Capital Theater tomorrow night.</p>

<p>The master of stage craft, Frank Mayo, in dramatizing Mark Twain's quaint and humorous story of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" gave to the reading public a new and a better interpretation of the quiet pettifogging Missourians [sic] than Twain in his most enthusiastic moments ever dreamed that character capable of.  Yet it remains for the actor who plays the part to so impress it upon the mind and heart of his auditors that they upon leaving the play house stamp his delineation with the verdict of greatness.  Such high praise does not befall every artist; but if all that has been said about Theodore Hamilton's rendition of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" be true, then that scholarly southerner has attained a position near the topmost rung on the ladder of fame.  Competent critics proclaim Mr. Hamilton's work to be simple, natural and unexaggerated, surrounding his utterances with the poetry of nature so soothing in its well mellowed shades that it sets the heart aflame with love and makes his hearers declare that Pudd'nhead Wilson is one of the most beautiful and idylic characterizations ever seen upon the stage.  Mr. Hamilton will be ably supported by Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., son of Joseph Jefferson the eminent comedian, and an excellent company.</p>

<p>Faith that is shown by works is aptly illustrated by the business management under which Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" comes to this city in its initial tour through this section.  It will be recalled that upon his last trip south Joseph Jefferson took occasion to pay a very flattering compliment to "Pudd'nhead Wilson" and its author.  Mr. Jefferson said that in his estimation Frank Mayo in dramatizing Mark Twain's story had produced one of the best of our native dramas; that he had just seen a performance of it and that it was one of the most delightful entertainments he has ever witnessed.  It was Mr. Jefferson, too, who advised the engaging of Mr. Theodore Hamilton to play the part left vacant by the death of Frank Mayo, and that Mr. Jefferson's judgment was not at fault is evinced by the many and high encomiums that are justly bestowed upon Mr. Hamilton for his protrayal of the quaint old Missouri lawyer.  Mr. Hamilton will present this quiet yet effective story of southern life with all that attention to detail that made its presentation in its long run in New York so successful, and he has surrounded himself with a cast culled from among the artists of the stage who will aid him in giving Mark Twain's characters their true interpretation.  This beautiful symphony of the southeast comes to us tonight and should receive the attention of all who love the pure in dramatic art.</p>
