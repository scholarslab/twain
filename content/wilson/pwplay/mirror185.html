<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson opened at the Academy 11 to very fair business.  The performance was an excellent one.  Edwin Mayo appeared to advantage in the title role, though evidently suffering from a cold.  Ada Dwyer gave a really splendid performance of Roxy, and the rest of the parts were in thoroughly capable hands.</p>
