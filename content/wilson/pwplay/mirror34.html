<p>THE PUDD'NHEAD WILSON DECISION</p>

<p>In last week's MIRROR brief note was made of Justice Pryor's decision in the Mayo Evans case respecting the rights of both parties to the play of Pudd'nhead Wilson. As published, Justice Pryor decided that the manuscript of the play reverted legally to the Mayo estate. The technical basis for this decision will be found in the subjoined copy of Justice Pryor's opinion:</p>

<p>"Upon the terms and intent of the copartnership arrangement it is clear that the play was not to become the property of the partnership. The right conveyed by Mayo to the copartnership was the right to produce the play during the four years of the copartnership existence, and on termination that right would, of course, revert to Mayo. Meanwhile, should Evans exercise his option to dissolve the copartnership, the manuscript&ndash;possessed by the copartnership only for the purposes of production&ndash;is, by express provision of the agreement, to be returned to Mayo. The copartnership is ended by an event not contemplated by the parties, namely, by the death of Mayo; and in the absence of any provision for that contingency, the question is: Does the property in the play survive the remaining partner, or vest in Mayo's personal representative? As the agreement did not impart the ownership of the play to the copartnership, no right to it could pass to the surviving partner. But the agreement did communicate to the copartnership the right to produce the play during the four years of the copartnership existence; and then the question is: Does that right survive to Evans? Manifestly not.</p>

<p>"By the agreement between the parties Mayo engaged to 'render his services as an actor in the said play.' In his brief the learned counsel for the defendant says: 'It must be noted that Mr. Mayo was a well-known actor, a man of great ability in his profession, and well adapted to perform the peculiar character and leading part in the play, and Mr. Evans was not only induced to go into the enterprise by his approval of the manuscript as a play, but also from his confidence in Mr. Mayo's ability to perform the part.' By the death of Mayo, therefore, the contract between the parties becomes impossible of performance, and in legal effect is dissolved (Lacy v. Getman, 119 N. Y., 109, 115; Greenburg v. Early, 4 Misc. 99, 102; Johnson v. Hartshorne, 52 N. Y., 173, 176). The inevitable conclusion is that the play passes to Mayo's representative. SInce, from the nature of the case, irreparable injury will ensue to the plaintiff from the sale or production of the play, an interim injunction is the allowable and appropriate relief (Grill v. Wiswall, 82 Hun, 281) Motion granted, with costs; order to be settled on notice."</p>

<p>Messrs. Atchison and Bower were Mr. Mayo's attorneys; Charles Henry Butler represented Mr. Evans.</p>
