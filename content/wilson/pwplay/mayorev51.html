<p>Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson," of which we have heard so much, will be presented at the opera house on Saturday evening of this week by Mr. Edwin Mayo and the same supporting company that played in this production during its long run at the Herald Square Theatre, New York city.</p>

<p>The Rochester (N.Y.) Post Express has the following to say of the attraction as it was seen at the Lyceum Theatre in that city only two weeks ago:</p>

<p>The large audience at the Lyceum last evening was not disappointed in Edwin Mayo's interpretation of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," a play that seems destined to live as long as "The Old Homestead" and "Shore Acres."  To those familiar with Frank Mayo's interpretation of the character of Dave Wilson, the son's performance was surprising.  He met every requirement of the difficult role with ease and dignity and grace, and in every way he proved a worthy successor of his father.  In this, the third production in this city of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," its presentation was the scenic and artistic equal of the first production, and for this Mr. Mayo deserves great praise.</p>

<p>The company supporting Mr. Mayo is excellent.  A criticism of the work of each member of the cast, would be little less than cavil.  Tom Driscoll, Chambers, and Roxy, most difficult roles, did not suffer in the hands of their interpreters.  In all, it was what may be called a harmonious performance, and the audience attested its appreciation by several curtain calls, two at the conclusion of the performance.</p>

<p>The sale of seats will open Thursday morning.</p>
