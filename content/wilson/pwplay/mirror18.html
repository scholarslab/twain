<p>I don't know when I have enjoyed a performance as I did that of Pudd'nhead Wilson at McVicker's, where it is doing a large business. The second week opened last night. I have always taken off my hat to Mr. Mayo for what he has done, and I now make to him a sweeping obeisance for what he is doing. He is a great artist. As we left the theatre Mrs. Hall paid two actors what I think was a great compliment to both. She Said: "Mr. Mayo is as thoroughly artistic as E. M. Holland." Good work is done in the company by Frank E. Aiken, another old timer. Once in a while a man longs for "the palmy days."</p>
