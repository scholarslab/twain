<p>Edwin Mayo appeared at the Broadway 1-6 to fair business in that intensely interesting play, Pudd'nhead Wilson.  Edwin Mayo gives a careful, well balanced portrayal of Pudd'nhead, the difference being that while the elder Mayo was the character the younger one merely acts it, but does so mighty well, nevertheless.  Mrs. Mayo's Roxy had much merit to it, but at times lacked dramatic fervor.  Frank Campeau's Tom Driscoll was a fair performance, and William R. McKey's Sheriff Blake was one of the best drawn character studies I have ever seen.  Edwin Malod, Belle Stoddard, Colin Campbell, and Tess Maguire all played well.  The play was well staged and mounted.</p>
