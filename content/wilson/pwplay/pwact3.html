&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Goes to desk R.)</font><br />
Not yet back and this his tenth day away.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Now why couldn't he tell me where he was going.<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Enter Rowy L.U.E.)</font><br />
<br />
<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Has he returned yet? Has Uncle Dave come back?<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C.)</font><br />
How should I know?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(As if about to cry)</font><br />
Does he ever tell me anything?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(X R. Going to window R.)</font><br />
Said he'd be back this morning sure.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Coming C.L.)</font><br />
Oh! I suppose he told you not to tell me, humph, but I want him to come just to see the mess he has made with his meddling.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
What mess, Maw?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Comes C.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Hasn't Judge Driscoll gone and challenged the Count?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Rowy</center>
Oh! that's because he kicked Tom Driscoll.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
And all brought about by your uncle's meddling in the affairs of that old robber Roxy. And now that Chambers has gone and run away with her &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Rowy laughs aside, crosses C., picks up book at table C.)</font><br />
Sheriff Blake says he's in it just as deep as his mother.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Then Sheriff Blake and every one in Dawson is a &ndash; don't know what they're talking about. Why don't they suspect me, they might as well.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Crossing to Cabinet L.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Hold your tongue. What do you know about it?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Turns L.C. near cabinet)</font><br />
I know this, that that boy Chambers would sooner cut off his arm than do a dishonest action. And I'm going to defend him against these slanders. As he defended me against the insults of Tom Driscoll.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
Hey? What's that? What's Tom Driscoll been saying to you?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Well, you ask my uncle.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
You reckon I'd waste my breath asking him anything? Tell me this minute what Tom Driscoll said to you or I'll march right over and ask him myself.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Going to D.R.3.E.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(X up L.)</font><br />
Can't Maw.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up R.C.)</font><br />
Why?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.)</font><br />
Tom's gone to St. Louis.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
Oh! I wonder if he really has gone there this time.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Coming C.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Crossing to her C.)</font><br />
What do you mean, Maw?<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
Ask your uncle.<br />

<br />
<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Morning ladies. Aunt Patsy &ndash; where's Dave?<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up L.)</font><br />
Ask your uncle.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Exits L.U.E. in rage)</font><br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Hey? What's the matter with your Maw, Rowy?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
Only cross, cause Judge Driscoll's challenged the count.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Oh! yes, powerful bad feeling set in agin them twins. I suppose you know that yarn they been telling about that knife they pretended to have lost.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
Pretend &ndash; why they did lose it. It was stolen from their boxes in my uncle's office.<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C. Mysteriously)</font><br />
Did you ever see the knife?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
No, I never saw it.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Did any one else ever see it?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
What do you mean?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Don't believe there ever was such a knife.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
What?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
You see &ndash; Tom Driscoll, he gave the whole thing away. One of them twins, the oldest I believe, once killed a man and with a knife. Ever since he has been brooding over his crime and that is why they go about from place to place &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Touches his forehead.)</font><br />
&ndash; always hunting for a knife &ndash; a lost knife.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Crosses R.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R. Crosses C.)</font><br />
Oh! that's the way of it, is it?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
Well, that's the way I heard it.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
That's the way you heard &ndash; Well you better get things straight before you tell them again, and I'd just like to know what put it into your head to suspect that boy Chambers.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C.)</font><br />
What in thunder did he run away for?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Enter Wilson L. Passes window.)</font><br />
<br />
<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.)</font><br />
Didn't run away, mor'n my uncle did.<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Enter Wilson R.U.E. X C.)</font><br />
<br />
<center>Blake</center>
Hello, Dave.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Runs to him and kisses him. Up C.)</font><br />
Oh! Uncle Dave I'm so glad you've come back.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Enter Patsy L.U.E. She stands rigidly at door.)</font><br />
Oh, Maw, here's Uncle Dave.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
How do, Patsy?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up R.C.)</font><br />
You said you wanted to see me, Dave.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up L. sternly)</font><br />
Dave Wilson.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Hey?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(All look at her)</font><br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up L.)</font><br />
Have you had any breakfast this morning?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Almost weeping)</font><br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
No I've been so busy I forgot it.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
Thank you for that much confidence at least.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Going L.U.E.)</font><br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Running over to her L.)</font><br />
Want me to help you maw?<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
Ask your uncle.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Exit L.U.E.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Smothered laugh aside to Dave)</font><br />
Oh you just wait till she gets you alone.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Comes down L.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.L.     Bus[iness]: with papers &ndash; takes them from pocket.)</font><br />
Sheriff, I've got to see Judge Driscoll before I can say what I wanted to.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C.)</font><br />
Anything about Roxy and her boy?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Yes.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Boys will make it mightly hot for him if he gets ketched. You know he laid violent hands on Tom Driscoll<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Rowy starts to speak and is stopped by a look from Wilson)</font><br />
<br />
<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.L. Looking at Rowy.)</font><br />
How was that, Sheriff?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
Why Miss Rowy, you ought to know about that. Tom said it was all about you. Says the niggar was sassy to you.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Cross R.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Crossing as if to go to Blake)</font><br />
Now, I'm mad.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Putting out her hand, Wilson takes her hand.)</font><br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Count four)</font><br />
Sheriff, I may want you to go to St. Louis, &ndash; officially of course.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Pleased)</font><br />
Ain't been in St. Louis for mor'n a year now.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Wilson looks at him)</font><br />
Oh! I can get ready. Got to see the Judge first though about ketching that boy.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Working up R.)</font><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Wilson sits L. at table)</font><br />
No he ain't offered no reward yet. I advised him about it. Judge mighty cranky about it yesterday though.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Going R.U.E.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(X up C. Enjoying it)</font><br />
What did he say Sheriff?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R. Both up stage)</font><br />
Who, Judge?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C. Laughing)</font><br />
Yes.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Working up to door R.)</font><br />
Well he wasn't over polite about it, I must say.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(In door R.U.E.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
What did he say?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Well, I suppose he knows he's Judge. Said &ndash; I could go to &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Exit R.3.E.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Did Chambers come back with you?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Seated L. at table.)</font><br />
No, I left him in St. Louis to watch Tom.<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Back of his chair)</font><br />
Watch Tom!<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Yes.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Cross C. Just L. of C. table)</font><br />
I've shown all the consideration for that young man I intend to. His offensive language to you has turned the natural current of my usually gentle dispositions into a riotous torrent and nothing shall assuage it until I have landed that young man in prison.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Takes bill from pocket.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Tom Driscoll in prison?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Thomas &Agrave; Becket Driscoll is altogether useless on top of ground. He ought to be under it inspiring the cabbages. Here is something I intend to call his uncle's attention to. When, if he fails to make a complaint, I shall. And that is what will take Sheriff Blake to St. Louis.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(He hands her the circular.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
What's that?<?speech>

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Sit L. of table C.)</font><br />
A circular, offering a reward of one hundred dollars for the capture of a runaway nigger.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Doesn't mean Chambers, does it?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
This is a woman, the property of John Moorehead.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Who's he?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L. of table)</font><br />
A down river planter.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Over to him &ndash; over his shoulder.)</font><br />
Who's the woman?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Roxy.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Roxy!  Why I thought she was free.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Go L. a little)</font><br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
So did I. Seems different here though.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Looking at hand bill)</font><br />
Oh! Can't be the same Uncle Dave. Must be some mistake.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
No there isn't. I've been making some inquiries in St. Louis where I found that Tom owed this man Moorehead a gambling debt of $650.00.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Oh! Uncle Dave, you don't believe &ndash;<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Yes, I do, I believe that Tom Driscoll kidnapped Roxy and sold her to John Moorehead to pay that debt.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Oh! What makes you think that?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
This &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Reads)</font><br />
The above reward will be paid by applying to Thomas A. Driscoll, and see, this is his address in St. Louis.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Oh, my, did you know the Judge had driven him from his home?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Twins pass C. window from L.)</font><br />
<br />
<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Rise)</font><br />
Yes, and I'll bet he's torn up another will. That has been the Judge's pasttime for years, but he'll be fattening the calf presently for the prodigal's return.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Rises and crosses R. go up C.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Following Wilson up L.C.)</font><br />
I don't know about that. I don't reckon Judge was ever so angry before.<br />

<blockquote><font color="#FF0000">(Enter Luiji and Angelo R. 3 E. They are very excited and come down R. C.)</font></blockquote>

<center>Wilson</center>
Good morning gentlemen. Rowy didn't I hear your maw say something about breakfast? And I'm just beginning to remember that I'm hungry.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up L.)</font><br />
I'll hurry it. Excuse me gentlemen.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Exits L.U.E.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Everything is arranged. The meeting it to take place at four P.M.<br /><br />

<center>Luiji</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C.)</font><br />
The sooner the better. The affair once over we shall leave Dawson.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
I don't believe I would allow myself to be driven out of town by such a fellow as Tom Driscoll<br /><br />

<center>Angelo</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
We give no thought to him &ndash; but his uncle &ndash; <br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Wilson</center>
Nor his uncle either. Oh, the Judge is a nice man, but he isn't infallible, and I propose to lift my voice against this crowding out process. They started in once on me, that way, some years ago, but I haven't gone yet and I still live in the hopes of making my presence felt in this self-satisfied community. I have counted a little on your aid in this missionary work.<br /><br />

<center>Angelo</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
We cannot walk the streets without insults.<br /><br />

<center>Luiji</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C.)</font><br />
Even the possession of the knife such as we have lost is questioned.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Oh yes, I know the source of that tale.<br /><br />

<center>Angelo</center>
Ah! you know?<br /><br />

<center>Luiji</center>
Who dares?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
No use seeking redress from that quarter though. A fellow who won't fight for being kicked isn't going to let a little matter like this stimulate his courage.<br /><br />

<center>Angelo</center>
It was he?<br /><br />

<center>Luiji</center>
Young Mr. Driscoll?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Hit it both, first time gentlemen.<br /><br />

<center>Luiji</center>
But his uncle, can he believe &ndash;<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Wilson</center>
The Judge's insane admiration for that calf is a prejudice too deep for my plumbing.<br /><br />

Breakfast, uncle.<br />

Good morning, Rowy. Sheriff Blake said your uncle wanted to see me.<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
He has just sat down to breakfast.<br /><br />

Well, don't disturb him &ndash; I'll &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(As if to go &ndash; returns.)</font><br />
Rowy, what do you think now of that ingrate, Chambers, to scamper off in that way? Is it true that he was impudent to you?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Now who told you that?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up C.R.)</font><br />
Blake, not five minutes ago.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Oh! But that Sheriff Blake is a fool. Chambers was never impudent to anyone, much less to me.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C. Taking her hands)</font><br />
Well, I'm mighty glad to know that. I reckon, Rowy, that boy always belonged more to you than to anybody else.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Yes I know. And to think that Tom missed a chance like this and what do you think? The scoundrel has dared to write to me.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Going R.3.E.)</font><br />
York, you must not face the Count with this on your mind. I'll wait for you over the way. I would read Tom's letter.<br />

What is it, Tom's letter?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(X C. front of table.)</font><br />
Yes, and it's all right. Embrace me, my friend, embrace me. I have wronged him. He is not [the] poltroon we thought him. It is a heart  of gold. He has acted like a Cavalier. Like a Knight of old. He has acted like a Driscoll, sah. He is my nephew, sah.<br />

He will, I dare say, tell you why York Driscoll cannot meet Count Luiji on the field of honor.<br /><br />

Good morning, Judge.<br />

If you don't object &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(To Howard)</font><br />
I would like to see the Judge alone.<br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.)</font><br />
One moment, Mr. Wilson. Do you know of a reason why York Driscoll should refuse to meet the Count?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Hey &ndash; well the Count's an orphan &ndash;<br /><br />

I see, I see, that will do.<br />

You shall not be urged. I see &ndash; Tom's views are yours.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C. going R.U. and returns.)</font><br />
Not another word. You know there are reasons why no gentleman can afford to meet the Count Luiji on the field of honor.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(To Howard, not heeding Wilson.)</font><br />
I shall re-write my will tonight.<br />

Dave Wilson, you have risen in my estimation one hundred per cent.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C. up)</font><br />
Well, you haven't in mine.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up R. Crossing R.C.)</font><br />
Do you gather anything from this?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Down C.)</font><br />
Yes, Tom has been lying again.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C.)</font><br />
Sir, you should be more guarded in your remarks.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
No I shouldn't either. My arraignment of Tom Driscoll's veracity is altogether a premeditated matter. He is a liar from the foundation of his nature.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Hush! sh &ndash; sh &ndash; sh.<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Wilson</center>
I'm not going to hush sh &ndash; sh either. I have lived long enough now in this community to speak my mind freely.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
Really, your defense of the Count &ndash;<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
I'm not defending the Count. He's quite capable of doing his own talking. This is a matter personal to me and to my family, and one for which Tom Driscoll must atone. Not as a gentleman either, for I reckon his recent conduct has placed him beyond the pale of that consideration.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Are you aware that you are speaking to his friend, sir? To the friend of his family?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
That is why I do not speak in an undertone.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
You wish me to convey your words to Judge Driscoll?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
If you don't object.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Back of table C.)</font><br />
Something that will interest you Rowy. These are the thumb marks of Tom and Chambers when they were babies. I got them the morning Tom was christened. Look.<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R. of him.)</font><br />

May 19th, 1836. Oh! that's a long time ago. Have you kept these all this time?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Yes. Can you distinguish a difference?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Plainly. How funny. Not a bit alike, are they?<br /><br />

I'm sure I could. Oh! my, do all thumbs make marks like that?<br /><br />

I'm afraid you are an incorrigible little heathen, Rowy.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Takes the two glasses and holds them up.)</font><br />
Well! by the great constitution of these United States! You're right. Now what does this mean. I never mislabelled one of those plates in all my life. Wait a minute. I have them here again when they were twelve years of age.<br />
