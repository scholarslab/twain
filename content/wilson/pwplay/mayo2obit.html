        <center><b>DEATH OF EDWIN F. MAYO.</b></center>

<p>Edwin F. Mayo died suddenly on Sunday night of heart failure at the Chateau Frontenac, Quebec, in which city he was to have opened a two nights' engagement in Pudd'nhead Wilson yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayo was the son of Frank Mayo, famous in Davy Crockett and other plays.  He was brought up in the theatre, having been carried on the stage as an infant and grown to adult parts.  His boyhood days were spent in Rochester, where Frank Mayo for a time managed the old Opera House.  His first role of any prominence was that of the boy in Davy Crockett in his father's company.  He also appeared with his father in The Streets of New York at the Grand Opera House, in this city, Feb. 26, 1883; in Nordeck at the Union Square Theatre, May 20, 1885, and in the same play at the Lyceum theatre later in the season.</p>

<p>On June 13, 1887, Mr. Mayo took the title role in Davy Crockett in a production of the play at the Grand Opera House, this city, and won success in the part.  He starred in the play the following season and was seen in it at the People's Theatre, New York, week of April 23, 1888.  He next produced The Silver Age, that had its New York presentation at the Thalia Theatre in January, 1889, and at the People's Theatre in April of the same year.  Subsequently Mr. Mayo rejoined his father and acted with him in Nordeck at the People's Theatre in May, 1890, and as Bishopriggs in The Athlete at Niblo's, Dec. 15, 1891.  In the production of After Twenty Years at Niblo's Dec. 20, 1892, Mr. Mayo took the dual leading role of Aaron Abraham and Major Douglas.  In January, 1894, he supported Mrs. John Drew in The Road to Ruin at the Star Theatre.</p>

<p>After his father's death, in 1896, Mr. Mayo succeeded as the star of Pudd'nhead Wilson.  Since that time he had continued to tour in the play, and had won much success in the title role.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayo's first wife was Jennie Bartine, from whom he was divorced Sept. 2, 1886.  On Sept. 12, 1888, he married Frances Graham, who has appeared with him in Pudd'nhead Wilson.  Mr. Mayo's sister, Eleanor, once well known on the operatic stage, is now the wife of James Elverson, of Philadelphia, and has retired from the profession.  He had also a younger sister, Deronda.</p>
