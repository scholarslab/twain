          <b>MRS. FRANK MAYO<br />
In Mark Twin's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the Tremont</b></center>


        <p>At the Tremont Theatre last night a good company of
        spectators witnessed the first performance in this city of
        Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson," in a dramatic form. The
        version presented was the work of Mr. Frank Mayo, who also
        impersonated the philosophical, astute, and unappreciated
        hero of the tale.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo was received with a friendly warmth, which
        testified in behalf of many in his audience, not only to
        their recollections of Tom Badger and Davy Crockett, but,
        perhaps, to their remembrance of the actor's remarkable
        performance of parts as difficult as Shakespeare's "King
        Henry VIII."</p>

        <p>Opinions differ as to the degree of exactness with which
        Mr. Mayo's work as a playwright has reproduced the
        personality of Mr. Clemens's chief figure. But the great
        majority of theatre goers will probably be willing to
        sacrifice much of the huge mass of the novel and will be
        quite satisfied with the substance of the plot and with the
        faithfully reproduced outlines of Wilson and his confreres
        of Dawson's Landing in Missouri.</p>

        <p>The story is certainly told in a succinct and
        interesting way. The basis idea -- the substitution of one
        infant for another much resembling it -- is old and has
        been made the theme of tragedy, melodrama and comic opera;
        but in "Pudd'nhead Wilson" the introduction of slavery and
        the "one thirty-second portion" of Ethopian blood, whose
        supposed possession dooms one of the children to a life of
        bondage gives a singular poignancy and pathos to the
        situation. No other contrast in conditions can be like
        that, for no difference between rich and poor, between high
        and low, between the well-reputed and the ill, is to be
        compared to the difference between the freeman and the
        slave. The added race prejudice completes the force of the
        situation.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo has been more than fairly successful in
        catching the life, spirit and quality of Mr. Clemens's
        sketches. The simplicity and provinciality of a rural
        village in a border slave state before the war, are
        admirably well reproduced. The peculiar high-bred Southern
        solemnity and that elaborate dignity so ludicrously close
        to pomposity, the Southern gallantry towards women, the
        Southern combination of gentleness and combativeness, the
        impenetrable Southern prejudice on the subject of race, and
        the Southern suavity and charm are all so well and so
        picturesquely suggested, that occasional extravagances and
        excesses may be excused.</p>

        <p>The performances must be pronounced to be, on the whole,
        admirably good. We are afraid that Mr. Mayo's impersonation
        of Wilson can hardly be regarded as quite convincing. But
        for that deficiency author rather than actor may be
        chargeable. Pudd'nhead Wilson is after all a grotesque and
        eccentric personage rather than a representative. He stands
        as a sort of humorous ideal of the shrewd, observing,
        deep-thinking man, whose superior wisdom passes for
        foolishness among his shallow associates. And Mr. Mayo
        makes him a striking, entertaining and very interesting
        figure. His large, simple style, his loping walk, his mild
        serenity and imperturbability, his slow, deliberate speech,
        his bashfulness of manner under excitement, his combination
        of long-suffering patience with deep-seated pride and
        conviction of his own superiority, are striking in Mr.
        Mayo's performance. His violent contortions of mouth, nose
        and face to express dissent, or doubt, or the entrance of a
        new idea into his head are less interesting, but cannot be
        rejected as mere absurdities, since they befit a character
        whose eccentricities were developed under conditions which
        developed eccentricity and encouraged it into a free and
        flaunting life.</p>

        <p>The only feature of Mr. Mayo's performance to which
        definite exception could be taken was the gross
        farcicalness of his pantomime at the beginning of his
        address to the jury. That was in an old and exploded vein.
        But for the most part, his playing was large in humor,
        dislayed native power and was easily and dramatically
        effective. Good acting abounded in the support. Mr. Arnold
        Daly's assumption of Chambers, the real white boy, was
        really exquisite in its delicacy, grace and sweetness, with
        a fine suggestion of interior underlying power. Mr.
        Campeau's performance of Tom Driscoll was a masterpiece of
        savage, cowardly blackguardism. Miss Eleanor Moretti, as
        Roxby, the slave mother, showed remarkable mastery of
        histrionic processes, and at times great force and fire,
        with contrasting cleverness in hitting the Ethiopian
        carelessness and levity. Her mode was sometimes too
        theatrical, but her picturesqueness and power were
        undeniable. Mr. Aiken's assumption of the serious judge who
        came from Virginia, Miss Grahame's of the warm-hearted
        Rowy, Mr. Klauber's and Mr. Hallton's of the Italian twins,
        Mr. Chisnell's of the sheriff, and indeed nearly every
        performer deserves favorable mention. The evening with
        Pudd'nhead Wilson is, on the whole, unique, and abounds in
        delightful experiences.</p>

        <p>Mr. Frank Mayo has long been favorably known as an
        actor, and he now demands attention as a dramatist. He
        appeared in both capacities at the Tremont theater last
        evening and won cordial applause from a well pleased
        audience. There were plenty of plaudits throughout the
        performance and after the third act the actor-dramatist was
        called before the curtain half a dozen times.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo has developed a very entertaining play from
        Mark Twain's story about the man who devoted most of his
        life to studying the lines on people's thumbs, and who
        consequently came to be regarded as a "pudd'nhead." It is
        not a particularly well-constructed play, technically
        considered, but it is brimful of bright lines, quaint
        character sketches and contrasted bits of humor and pathos
        which appeal very strongly to the sympathies of an
        audience.</p>

        <p>He has used excellent judgment in selecting material
        from the book, but he has tried to use too much. It is a
        common fault in dramatization of popular books, this effort
        to introduce a multitude of incidents, many of which are
        not sufficiently close in their relations to permit of
        intelligible presentation in the limited confines of a
        play.</p>

        <p>There were moments last evening when one who had not
        read the book might have found it difficult to understand
        certain happenings. Another fault is the excessive amount
        of explanatory dialogue about what has happened and about
        what is likely to happen. A properly-constructed play tells
        its story by action, rather than by dialogue.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo has however given us a play which almost
        everyone will enjoy, and it is a good wholesome play on an
        American subject. It is for the most part a comedy, but
        there are some stirring scenes of a melodramatic order.
        Pathos is not lacking, but it is not so real as the fun,
        which is always spontaneous and irresistible in compelling
        laughter. Many of the character sketches are extremely
        amusing, and although some of them are rather overdrawn,
        they all possess a suggestion of genuineness and seem
        thoroughly appropriate to the delightful southern
        atmosphere of their surroundings.</p>

        <p>The story is told in a prologue and four acts, and
        follows the book closely, so far as plot is concerned, but
        numerous changes have been made in minor incidents and
        character development. In the prologue the two babies are
        changed and the slave's son is accepted as the heir of the
        house. The first act begins when the children have grown to
        manhood. The rightful white son has been reared as a slave
        and the negro, with only a slight taint in his blood, lives
        as his half-brother's master. They are the sons of the same
        father.</p>

        <p>To pay a gambling debt, the negro, disguised as a woman,
        robs various houses, and his mother, who has returned to
        her old home to see him, is suspected of the crime and
        accused by her son.</p>

        <p>The suspicion falls afterward on the white slave, when
        Pudd'nhead Wilson's discovery of the unmistakable thumb
        mark convicts the guilty man.</p>

        <p>One of the best scenes is the play is act the close of
        the third act, when the gentle Pudd'nhead is made to
        believe that his cherished theory regarding the
        infallibility of thumb marks has been exploded. It is quiet
        and simple, but extremely effective. There is also a strong
        melodramatic scene between the slave mother and her son,
        and this awakened much applause last evening.</p>

        <p>But the best act from a dramatic point of view is the
        last. This is constantly interesting, and is developed with
        splendid dramatic skill until the very last moment, when an
        ill-timed joke from one of the characters mars the artistic
        effect of an otherwise impressive ending.</p>

        <p>The success of the play depends very much upon the title
        character. This is a deliciously quaint and humorous
        creation, and Mr. Mayo presents it with wonderous fidelity
        to life. It is vastly different from the heroic roles with
        which Mr. Mayo has heretofore been associated, and that he
        played it so delightfully was a pleasant surprise to his
        friends. It is a characterization sure to live and long be
        associated with the actor's name.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mayo is supported by a capable company. Miss Eleanor
        Moretti made an excellent impression as the slave mother,
        and in appearance fully realized the character. Her acting
        in the more impassioned scenes was very effective. There
        was a good deal of intense realism in Mr. Frank Campeau's
        impersonation of a cowardly and cruel rascal, and Mr.
        Arnold Daly gave an admirable portrayal of the rightful
        heir. There are several others in the cast who give careful
        and picturesque character sketches, and the scenery and
        stage accessories are beautiful and appropriate.</p>

<p>There was a large house at the Tremont this evening when Frank Mayo gave Bostonians their first chance to see Pudd'nhead Wilson. Mr. Wilson had not played here for a number of years, and the interest in the new play was unusual. As the star has always been a great favorite and the company contains many who are equal favorites here, a banner engagement is to be expected, judging from the enthusiasm which was manifested this evening.</p>
