<p>The above cast, presenting "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the Lyceum, may truthfully be said to be the best attraction offered by an Atlanta theater this year.  This may sound a bit strong, for Atlanta has had some very good attractions this year, but nothing like "Pudd'nhead Wilson" or the excellent company presenting it.  There is no more finished an actor on the stage than Theodore Hamilton, who takes the part of "Pudd'nhead."  This old veteran of the stage is one of the old school of actors and the actors that are made nowadays have not reached the perfection of Mr. Hamilton.  It is hard to imagine how any one could be better in the part.  As an actor he is almost perfection.  Young Joe Jefferson shows remarkable ability in his part.  In the intensely dramatic climaxes he could not be excelled.  John Lucker as Tom Driscoll has a very hard and thankless part that he acts in a most artistic manner.  He has some of the hardest acting in the play and he does it in a most capable manner.  E. A. Locke as the county sheriff is life-like in his part.  He made a decided hit with the audience and deserved the applause accorded him.  Belle Stokes is a very charming little actress and is excellent in her part.  But to give sufficient praise to the company would be to take each one individually and dwell upon their merits.  Suffice it to say that the entire cast is excellent and it would be hard to improve on it.  As for the play of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," it is exactly like the book.  Mark Twain is in part of it almost.  His humor, his pathos make it a great play.  The story is too well known to repeat, but it is even more charming on the stage than it is in the book.  There is so much life in it, so much humor, so much that is good, ennobling and enjoyable in it that it may be classed among the best plays on the stage.  It is a play that lingers with you and as soon as the performance is concluded there is immediately a desire to see it again.  Those who miss it will miss the treat of the season.  The audience last night was thoroughly pleased.</p>
<p>The matinee today, the last performance, for the company leaves before night in order to make other engagements, will commence at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" was presented at the Lyceum last night and was, without doubt, one of the rarest dramatic treats of the season.</p>

<p>The play is a vivid and truthful picture of Southern life, the plot deeply interesting and skillfully worked out, and the characters true to life.  It is, in fact, an ideal play.  It was interpreted by a first class company, in which there were no weak spots.</p>

<p>Theodore Hamilton, an actor of the old school, and one of the best now on the boards, protrayed the quaint character of the title role in the most artistic manner.  He won the sympathy of the audience early in the evening and made every heart thrill with every motion as the play progressed.  The role could have been entrusted to no better hands.  The other parts were all played by capable actors.</p>

<p>There is some talk of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" coming back for a return engagement.  It is to be hoped that this will be done.  If so, it is safe to say a much larger audience will see it than witnessed last night's performance.</p>
