<p>What a pity there are not more plays like Pudd'nhead Wilson, with its splendid plot, well drawn characters, quaint sayings, homely philosophy, and effective situations.  Few plays combine a literary and dramatic value, and are so appealing in their entirety, as is this finished work of Mark Twain and Frank Mayo.  In the production, at the Broadway Jan. 29-4, I did not see Edwin Mayo's impersonation of the main part, as, after the opening performance, he was unable to play, his part being taken the remainder of the week by William S. Gill, who deserves much credit for his intelligent reading of the lines and carefully worked out conception of the character.  Mr. Gill has a good voice and admirable repose, and, while his portrayal was lacking in the detail and facial expression which made famous Frank Mayo's conception, as was to be expected, nevertheless, he did remarkably well.  Frank Campeau's Tom Driscoll was splendidly acted, and Ada Dwyer's Roxy could not have been improved upon.  W. R. McKey made a pronounced hit as the Sheriff.  Ralph Dean, Charles J. Edmonds, and Maribel Seymour deserve favorable mention. . . .</p>
