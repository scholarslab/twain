<p>Frank Mayo at the Broad&ndash;Little Christopher at the Chestnut&ndash;Other Houses</p>

<p>The opening night of last week promised well for the attractions playing here, but the hot spell that followed greatly reduced receipts, and some of our theatres played to empty benches. All our theatres are open, but our fashionable element is still out of town, and the season will not be fairly opened until Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Frank Mayo and his excellent company are in their second and last week at the Broad Street Theatre, and Pudd'nhead Wilson has made an emphatic success in this city.</p>
<p>. . . In Old Kentucky opened to night at the Chestnut Street Theatre for a two weeks' term, with prospects of large patronage. Creston Clarke follows Sept. 30.</p>
