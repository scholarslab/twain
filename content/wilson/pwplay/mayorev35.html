<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" will be presented at the Lyceum tomorrow night, Tuesday matinee and night.  This will be the second appearance of the play in Atlanta this season.</p>
<p>It was well received when it was here before, and was considered one of the treats of the season.  Large audiences marked its stay, and it became very popular with Atlanta theatergoers.</p>
<p>The company, headed by Theodore Hamilton, is a strong and evenly balanced one.  In every part there is a chance for good work, and the opportunities are not lost by the members of the company, who seem to strive for perfection.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night the play will be even better than it was when presented here before.  The tour made by the company has given it a chance to better study their parts.  The company carries its own scenery, which truthfully depicts the locale of the story.</p>
<p>The management of the Lyceum has made arrangements with the organization to place the price of admission for the choicest seats in the house at &#36;1 for this engagement.</p>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson," one of the most interesting comedy dramas on the American stage, will be at the Lyceum tonight with Mr. Theo Hamilton in the title role.</p>
<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" was written by Mark Twain and dramatized by Frank Mayo.  Two such men could not make a failure when their efforts were combined.  Mr. Hamilton is an actor of much more than ordinary gifts.  He is finished in his manner, natural in his acting and is Pudd'nhead Wilson from the moment he appears on the stage.</p>
<p>His support is worthy of him, and the entire production is acted and staged in a manner worthy of it.  As a matter of fact, the company is the same that has supported Mr. Joseph Jefferson during his tour this season.</p>
<p>The engagement is for tonight, a matinee tomorrow afternoon, with a final performance tomorrow night.</p>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson," with Theodore Hamilton as the inimitable Pudd'nhead, was presented at the Lyceum theater last night for the second time this season.  A large and appreciative audience was present and, if such is possible, the play was even better than when here before.</p>
<p>Besides being a veteran actor Mr. Hamilton is a southern gentleman of the old school.  He takes his part as well as it could be played and his interpretation of Mark Twain's unique character "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is most pleasing.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton is supported by a strong company.  John Tucker, as Tom Driscoll, plays a hard part well.  He does some artistic work and displays marked ability.</p>
<p>As county sheriff, E. A. Locke contributes much humor and made a decided hit with the audience.  Miss Belle Stokes and Miss Margaret Hayward are both good in their respective parts.  In fact, the whole company deserves praise for its work.  The show is one of the best that has visited Atlanta this season.</p>
<p>Mr. Theodore Hamilton is a confederate veteran and served in the First battalion, Eighth Virginia cavalry.  He requests that all members of his old regiment who may reside in Atlanta come to the Lyceum tonight and be his guests.</p>
<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" will be seen at matinees today and tonight.</p>

<p>. . . Pudd'nhead Wilson was the bill 7, 8.  This co., headed by Theodore Hamilton and Joseph Jefferson, Jr., drew three large houses at the Lyceum, although it had been here once before this season.  It is one of the best on the road and pleases everybody.</p>
