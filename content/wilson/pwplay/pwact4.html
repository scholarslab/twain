This is mighty kind of you, Aunt Patsy, but I reckon I will be able to attend at the Court House today.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>
In no way.<br /><br />

Yes, Dave?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
Tell Rowy to fetch me my breakfast. I'll be down in a minute.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy.</center>
All right, Dave. What do you think, that booby sat up here all night playing with those thumb things.<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(X down back of table C.)</font><br /> I came down here broad day light &ndash; and &ndash; bless me there's that lamp still burning.<br />

Brushing up his law, I reckon. He is conducting the Count's defence. Say to him that I wish to express my thanks for his kindness, and trust he will do himself credit in this his first case.<br />

<center>Patsy.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Back of table C.)</font><br />
Case, and such a case as he's made of it. The laughing stock of the court room, judge, jury and all, with his everlasting reference to them thumb things.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(At table picking up papers. Enter Dave Wilson L.U.E. to<br />

Now, Patsy, don't set things to rights. Was that York talking to you just now?<br /><br />

 <!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Patsy.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Cross R. with lamp)</font><br />
Yes. Looks mighty bad for the Count.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Bus[iness]: at table. Examining plate of glass etc.)</font><br />

<center>Patsy.</center>

Say, Dave, do you think that Count had that knife all along?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Well I was inclined to, when I listened to the testimony at the trial yeaterday. But my investigations here last night have settled that. For the blood stain marks on the handle of the that knife &ndash;<br /><br />

<center>Patsy.</center>
Now for Heaven's sake, do leave that out. You just make yourself the biggest fool &ndash; everybody in town's laughing at you.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
Well, I've gotten used to that. I reckon I can stand it a little longer. Tell Rowy to fetch me my coffee, Patsy.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(X up L.C.)</font><br />
Yes, Dave. Now Dave, do listen to sense. You were doing so nicely at the trial yesterday until you dragged in those thumb things, and then &ndash; my sakes alive! Now for goodness sakes don't do that again today. Or we'll just have to pack up and leave Dawson through sheer mortification.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Exit L.3.E. with lamp.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Back of table C. looking at enlarged thumb marks as<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he speaks)</font><br />
If we have to emigrate Patsy, it won't be for that. Now one of two persons made that attack on Judge Driscoll five days ago, yet as far as I can learn neither of them were in or near Dawson at the time, but that the blow was struck by Tom or Chambers, that I swear. But which? There's where I am stuck &ndash; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Taking up two glasses from small rack on table, C.)</font><br />
and all by my own carelessmess in mislabelling those plates. But to accuse those twins, no more like their marks than my signature is like that of the illustrious autograph of John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence.<br />

 <!-- <page></page> -->

If I could but imagine a motive. Surely the Judge's death could not have advantaged Tom for the will was destroyed and Tom knew it. And he returned as soon as he heard of the attack, while Chambers has disappeared from St Louis and gone no one knows where.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Shakes his head walks to R. window.)</font><br />
I am irretrievable damned if I lose this my first case.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Enter Rowy L.3.E. to back of table C. with coffee on<br />

<center>Rowy.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Back of table, L. end of it)</font><br />
It's just a mean, wicked, nasty suspicious world, that's what it is.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
Well, we are promised a better one by and by, but when I reflect on the number of disagreeable people who have gone there I am often moved to lead a different life.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Rowy crosses C. He sits back of table.)</font><br />
What has happened?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy.</center>
That horrid Sheriff Blake has arrested Chambers in St Louis.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
And brought him here?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy.</center>
Yes, and he said you told him to do it.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
Now, Rowy, like a good girl don't let the grass grow under your feet until you run over to Sheriff Blake's and tell him to bring his prisoner here.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Wilson has seated himself at table L.C. and commenced<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to eat breakfast.)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Rowy going R.3.E. suddenly stops, returns down R.C.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exit R.C.)</font><br />
I'm not sure Patsy, but we might as well pack up our effects at once. This looks more serious than I had thought.<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Enter Tom R.3.E.)</font><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C. Examining glasses)</font><br />
Yes. Must do something.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Tom cross L.)</font><br />
Tom, why don't you give me your thumb mark again.<br /><br />

<center>Tom.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.)</font><br />
Don't like the company. Niggers and whites too promiscuous. However, they say about here, you don't mind that.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Sit on L. corner of table, C.)</font><br />
Well, I do. Hear Blake has arrested that nigger Chambers?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
Yes, Tom I heard that.<br /><br />

<center>Tom.</center>
They say now, he did all that stealing.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
They say? Why don't they come forward?<br /><br />

<center>Tom.</center>
What good? Niggers can't testify.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Drinking coffee)</font><br />
Oh, niggers eh? They don't believe it was a woman, eh?<br /><br />

<center>Tom.</center>
Don't always follow that a woman's dress has got a woman in it.<br />

What, Tom?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Well, who cares what you are?<br /><br />

<center>Blake.</center>
What would your paw have said?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy.</center>
My father would have said as I say, that you are all a set of cowards and I just want you to understand me, this is some trumped up story. A wicked lie invented by some enemy of Chambers and I know who, but I'm not going to be scared off by him or any of you.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Driscoll appears in D.R.3.E.)</font><br />
I've been a lonely child with but one play fellow all my life, Chambers, no brother could have been kinder, and if I did not stand by him how, I'd be the most ungrateful girl alive.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Advancing R.C.)</font><br />
And you're right Rowy. This is some conspiracy to ruin my boy.<br /><br />

<center>Rowy.</center>
That's just what it is, Judge Driscoll, but it shan't succeed if I can help it, and if they think it unnatural in me to be loyal and grateful for a whole life of devotion, who protected, defended me always, who took by the throat the man who insulted me, as you have just done, Mr. Sheriff Blake, and made him get on his knees and ask my pardon. If this is unnatural then I am unnatural. There, now you know the exact state of my mind, all of you.<br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Sits R. at desk.)</font><br />
This is most distressing. Tom just told me of his arrest. Chambers, come here, sir.<br />

Only maybe jus' in fun, like dat.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
Then answer now. Did you know anything of those robberies?<br /><br />

<center>Chambers.</center>

Your Honor, and gentlemen of the jury. I do not wonder at the amazement I see depicted on your faces. Does the council feel that his case is so lame, so halt and his conduct of it so imbecile, so brainless that he must regard no such evasions? But it will not avail. Does he imagine that without one witness he can come whining and whimpering into this court to beg in advance a merciful consideration at the hands of this intelligent jury? I say it will not avail. Is not this a pitiable spectacle, your Honor, but it is his first case &ndash; and alas, alas, has our poor friend who all these years has hung out his sign attorney at law, not read the lesson of neglect, that has attended his call for clients? Then let him read it now. In this feeble, senile, driveling admission, "we have no witnesses" &ndash; For I challenge your Honor's memory to recall the like in this or in any other court in all the land, but your Honor and gentlemen of the jury, let us be merciful, and with that feeling of sweet kindness we all feel and acknowledge towards this simple minded gentleman, for it must be said his nature is harmless. Yet would I council him to husband that remnant of reason yet left. I would entreat him to cling to his toys of glass, and leave the law for others to interpret.<br /><br />

No sir, my will. It was about mid-night, and I had fallen asleep.<br /><br />

When I had finished writing my will and signed it, I inadvertantly made a remark aloud to myself, as a man will at times, when I thought I heard a footstep on the hall stair. Thinking it might be one of my servants I called, getting no reply I took my lamp and ascended the stair, but found no one.<br /><br />

<center>Howard.</center>
You returned to your desk?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>
Yes sir.<br /><br />

<center>Howard.</center>
You say you were alseep at the time of the attack?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>
Dosing, I was aroused by the quick and heavy breathing of some one at my back. I started to my feet when the lamp was extinguished.<br /><br />

<center>Howard.</center>
By the intruder?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>
That I cannot say, my own action might have done that. I had hardly risen when I felt the knife pierce by arm.<br /><br />

<center>Howard.</center>
And when the lamp was re-lighted where was that knife found?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll.</center>

Your honor, and gentlemen of the jury. Even the most perfect circumstantial evidence is likely to be at fault, and ought therefore to be received with great caution. We will take for example the sharpening of a pencil by a woman. If you have witnesses [to] this you will find she did it with a knife, and if you take the simple aspect of the pencil you will say she did it with her teeth.<br />

Now, what in thunder has that got to do with the case, I'd like to know.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
One of the advantages of the halting lameness of this defense lies in the fact that no court in Dawson in my time &ndash; and I have heard every case in twenty years &ndash; ever got off with so little of my friend's frothy flow of talk. His vigorous mouthing &ndash; his vituperative compliment &ndash; his pitiful stabs and his admiring sneers &ndash; but his sympathy for my feeble mentality is at once like him and the marvelous breadth of his own reasoning machine "windy nothing." I ought not to refer to the welcome brevity of his opening address, for I fear a charge of tediousness may be brought against me, for the stream of my eloquence has been so long dammed up, its flow may not be so readily stayed as you or I, or he could wish. Now, your Honor and gentlemen of the jury, the single feature of this case, that is worthy of consideration as evidence, is, the blood stained marks upon the handle of that knife. And it has been claimed by the prosecution that those marks were made by the hand that dealt the blow &ndash; Well, we grant that &ndash;<br /><br />

<center>Swan.</center>
Mighty!<br />

<center>Wilson.</center>
But whose was the hand? Is this to be determined by mere conjecture, or by the indisputable evidence of facts. Now what are the facts? I propose to show you. Every human being carries with him from the cradle to the grave certain physical marks, which never change, and by which he can always be identified. These marks are his signature, with its lines, its curves, and its flourishes. But where is it? You ask. There where nature has placed it. And forever unchangeable. It is there on the ball of the thumb.<br /><br />
