<center><b>CHICAGO.</b></center>

<p>Good Entertainment Well Patronized, but Poor Shows Play to Red Plush&ndash;Hall's Chat.</p>

<p>[<i>Special to The Mirror</i>]</p>

<p>The report appears to have gone abroad that this city has lost its reputation as a good "show town," and outsiders seem to imagine that there is not a dollar here for attractions. Kindly allow me to correct this erroneous impression. Good Shows are taking more money here than ever before, and bad shows (which appear to be more numerous this season than ever) are playing to red plush. Chicagoians will dig down deeper than ever to pay for a meritorious attraction, but will have none of the cheap and nasty at high prices. Mr. Southern has taken nearly fifty thousand dollars at Hooley's with his splendid performance of the Prisoner of Zenda in five weeks; Sol Smith Russell played to about ten thousand dollars at the Grand on New Year's week with The Rivals, and filled the theatre last week with An Every Day Man and Mr. Valentine's Christmas; while at half the regular prices The Passing Show took over eight thousand dollars at the Chicago Opera House. The Olympic stands people up all day long with continuous variety, and Colonel Hopkins does likewise at his South-Side house. Nearly one hundred thousand people paid fifty cents each to see the Bicycle Show at Tattersall's last week, and the two Jacobs' houses have never done so well since they were first opened. Give us a good show and we will pay for it, but Chicago will not accept the "confederate money" so frequently offered in exchange for good theatrical simoleons. Chicago is all right!</p>

<p>Over at McVicker's last night Frank Mayo scored an artistic triumph in Mark Twain's play Pudd'nhead Wilson. His company is an excellent one. </p>
<p>With Frank Mayo, Frank E. Aiken, Mary Meyers, and Roland Reed in town, the old stock days of Chicago are vividly recalled.</p>
