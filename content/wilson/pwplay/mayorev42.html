<p>We are told that Mr. Hamilton's Pudd'nhead is the crowning glory of his more than a quarter of a century of honest, ceaseless toil as a player, and that it may be set down as one of the greatest character delineations on the stage of to-day.  Those who are familiar with Twain's charming story know that Pudd'nhead Wilson is founded upon a deep knowledge of human nature, so deep in fact, that every actor who takes part in the presentation of the play must be an artiste, and each a student of the same.  With such players as thoroughly understand the exacting requirements of their respective roles, we are informed Mr. Hamilton has surrounded himself, chief among whom are noted the name of Joseph Jefferson, Jr., a son of America's most eminent comedian.  The production will be presented upon the same grand scale and with all the splendid scenic environments that made its long run at the Herald Square Theatre in New York a notable one in theatrical annals.  This attraction appears at the Grand Opera house to-morrow night.</p>
