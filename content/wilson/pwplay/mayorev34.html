        <center><b>THE SHOW LAST NIGHT.<br />
The "Pudd'nhead Wilson" Company Gives An Enjoyable Performance.</b></center>

<p>A large and well pleased audience gathered at Springer opera house last night to witness Mark Twain's popular play, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," with Mr. Theo. Hamilton in the title role.</p>
<p>The play is an excellent one, the plot being strong and clearly developed as the play progresses.  In the leading character of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" the work of Mr. Hamilton is much cleverer than is usually found in stock companies.  Mr. Hamilton is an actor of considerable ability and his interpretation of Mark Twain's character testifies to his genius and talent.  Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., appeared in the character of "Chambers," and his work was very good indeed.  The other members of the company, including "Sheriff" Blake and "the jury," were well up in their respective parts.  Columbus theater-goers will always be pleased to welcome Mr. Hamilton and his company.</p>
