<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
I tell you, York Driscoll, it's the only way. Dawson's Landing had a similar experience you may remember some years ago, and the remedy applied then was effectual. It must be tried again.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
It seems mighty hard to make the innocent suffer for the guilty. There's not a servant of mine but I believe to be perfectly honest.<br /><br />

<center>Jasper &amp; Others.</center>
God bless you, Marse Judge! We die for you!<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
My house servants are here, you can question them.<br />

All 'cept Chambers, Marse Howard.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Quickly to Howard)</font><br />
No &ndash; no &ndash; you needn't include him, I won't have him suspected.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(To Jasper and others)</font><br />
I reckon you understand we are searching for a thief, who for a long time has been most persistently robbing the houses of our citizens. Now we know the culprit is right here in our midst.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Turning to Jasper)</font><br />
Now Deacon Jasper, we hear from you first.<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
I clar to de Lord, whose servant I is, and for dis &ndash;<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Here! Here! don't give us a sermon, just tell us what you know.<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Crushed)</font><br />
I don't know nothin'.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Jasper, you have always had your liberty to go and come after dark. <br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
Yes Marse, I go pray wid the poor and de sinner.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
On such occasions have you seen no one prowling about?<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
Yes Marse, I done see dat sure.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Startled turns to Jasper)</font><br />
Ha! Ha! We are coming at it.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Who?<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
Roxy!<br />

<blockquote><font color="#FF0000">(Judge and Howard rise and show astonishment.<br />
Driscoll comes C.  Howard below table)</font></blockquote>

<center>Driscoll</center>
 Roxy? What Roxy?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Jasper</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Chambers' mother.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Why she's not here. Hasn't been these fifteen years.<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
She's hyar now, Marse Judge.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(To Driscoll)</font><br />
Did Chambers tell you she was here?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Turns to Howard)</font><br />
No, never.<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
Chambers don't know she's hyar yet, sir.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
How is that? Is she here surreptitiously?<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Puzzled)</font><br />
She hyar how? Marse how?<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
In hiding.<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
Yes, I can't deny that.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(To Driscoll)</font><br />
Sure enough some at the meeting said it was a woman.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Yes, that was Wilson.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Oh! Pudd'nhead, hey?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Where is Roxy hiding?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Jasper</center>
In de ole Wilson mill sir.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Go there, tell her I want to see her at once.<br /><br />

<center>Jasper</center>
Yes, Marse.<br />

<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Driscoll going L. to women and men)</font><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(As he sends them off he walks about C. troubled)</font><br />
You can return to your duties.<br />

God bless Marse.<br />

<br />
<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C.)</font><br />
Now this looks like business. And York you must allow no sentiment for that boy Chambers to interfere with your duty as a citizen.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
I shall not sir.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
But it will do no harm to threaten her. You can draw up the papers and those who have suffered by these thefts will only be too glad to sign. Now let's see, there's Swan, Campbell, Blake, you and I &ndash; that's five, now who's another.<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Enter Wilson R.U.E.  Comes down C.)</font><br />
<br />
<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.  Seeing him)</font><br />
What's the matter with Wilson?<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Xes to R. of table)</font><br />
That's so, I never thought of him. Say Pudd'nhead, did you say you knew Roxy was back here at the landing?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
No, I didn't say so, but I did know it though.<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Sits R. of table.  Driscoll sits L. bench.)</font><br />
Well now, why in thunder didn't you mention it at the meeting?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.  Takes drink at pump L.C.)</font><br />
Because I wasn't asked. Do I understand you to say, that you believe Roxy is the thief you're after?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Reluctantly)</font><br />
I am afraid circumstances justify it, yes.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
What are the circumstances, Judge?<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Angrily)</font><br />
Now, was there ever such a &ndash; a &ndash; I don't know what to call you Pudd'nhead.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
I wouldn't try to improve on the Pudd'nhead.<a href="javascript:Start('pwplayfn1.html')"><font size="+1"><b>*</b></font></a>  That has worn pretty well.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Haven't you said all along that you thought the thief was a woman?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Yes, but I didn't say I thought it was Roxy, though. In fact I don't believe it was.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Banteringly)</font><br />
By the eternal, York, if I don't believe Pudd'nhead is smelling out a case. Do you propose to defend her, Dave?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
No, 'taint that Pembroke. I am not even vouching for Roxy's honesty, that is altogether, not as a general thing. To tell the truth I know her to be rather a light fingered party, at least was some years ago. But I reckon the whole thing's outlawed now.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Well, well what was it?<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Take chair L. of table sit sideways C.)</font><br />
Oh! a trifling matter, when one comes to consider it at this distance. It was just after you gave her her freedom Judge, about fifteen or sixteen years ago now, I reckon wasn't it? She lingered about here for a spell doing odd chores for the boys. I was one of her customers. She did my washing. Best washerwoman I ever had too, by the way, only she was wasteful. I got to notice that my bosoms and dickeys and such became fewer and fewer the longer she had the handling of them, until one day I was compelled to remonstrate.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Oh, ho, she had been appropriating them had she?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Well I intimated as much, but she denied that on the ground that she had just experienced religion at a revival meeting. And she 'lowed she couldn't steal under such circumstances.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>

<stage(Laughing in derision)</font><br />
And you were fool enough to believe that?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
I just had to, Pembroke. A man's got to find something to pin his faith to, if he hopes to get any real enjoment out of this life.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Don't you know that the truth isn't in one of them?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
That may be, but to my mind there is something a mighty sight more entertaining than truth at times. That is I mean ordinary, every day truth.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Better than truth sir?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Rises)</font><br />
I didn't say better, I said more entertaining Judge.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Impatiently)</font><br />
More entertaining then.<br /><br />

<!-- <page></page> -->

<center>Wilson</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Put back chair)</font><br />
I reckon it's all a matter of disposition and taste, but for my part I like a lie. That is an unusual lie. One that has a flavor. One of proportion and dignity. Just such a lie as Roxy's. A kind of tell the truth or trump; but get the trick.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Did you accuse her?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
No, I apologized.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Ha, ha, and you let her fool you like that.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
I just had to Pembroke. I haven't the heart to blight the genius like that. It was too beautiful. I was fascinated, paralyzed as I stood there looking at her with my effects all over her, bosoms, dickeys and all, and a couple of my handkerchiefs turbaned about her head.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Howard laughs)</font><br />
<br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(As defending Roxy)</font><br />
Were you sure they were yours?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
On that's what made it picturesque Judge. My name stood out on the various articles as plainly as a circus poster on a dead-wall.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Ha, ha, ha. And you stood there and did nothing?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
No I didn't. I gave her another full set for a change.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Judge and Howard laugh)</font><br />
<br />

<center>Howard</center>
Well, you are a Pudd'nhead, however, that's just what might be expected of you.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Well, I like to be consistent, Pembroke.<br />

<center>Patsy</center>
Oh! You've got back, Dave. Good morning Howard. Good morning Judge. Dear me, I'm just up to my eyes fixing and arranging for our new lodgers. You know they are coming down from St. Louis on this boat.<br /><br />

Who, Tom?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.)</font><br />
Yes, got a letter from him last night.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
From St Louis?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Yes, why?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Go up C.L.)</font><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Nothing &ndash; only that's mighty strange.<br /><br />

Hey, what's mighty strange.<br />
<br />
<center>Wilson</center>
How the branch of that tree got broken.<br />

<center>Patsy</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Up C.L.)</font><br />

You mean Tom's room?<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Yes. See that broken limb just underneath the window?<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
Yes.<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
Well the morning after the last night robbery the snapping of that limb woke me up. It was just before daybreak. Jumping out of bed I ran to the window, pulled the curtains aside and right here I witnessed some very strange movements.<br /><br />

<center>Patsy</center>
What?<br /><br />

<center>Wilson</center>
First a nigger gal in a peculiarly flashy garment was climbing into Tom's room by that tree, another woman stood out here in the road.<br /><br />

Come here and I'll tell you a heap. I stood at my window watching Roxy as she went about moaning and clawing the air with her hands, so; and muttering as if she had lost her hold on something. Presently she went away. I stood watching for the other to appear. After a little I saw the blinds move, then slowly open, when a face appeared at that window that startled me.<br /><br />
