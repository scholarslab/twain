<p>An admirable play, well acted, is "Pudd'nhead Wilson," with Theodore Hamilton in the title role.  The attention to detail, the excellent cast, and the appropriate scenery and costumes make this a notable production.  It is a treat to see so many legitimate, old-time actors--real actors--as are in the cast of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," aside from Theodore Hamilton, the star.  John E. Ince of the cast was a popular "Our Boarding School" star, and has played Chinaman [sic] with as much favor as was ever granted to Chas. T. Parsloe, for similar work.  Mr. Ed. A. Locke, in the cast, brings back memories of the days when he was a dashing young comedian for Lotta, in the long ago.  There is in the cast also a chip of the old block which is sound yet, young Joseph Jefferson, Jr.  The company is a good one.  It is managed by Master Frank Chapman, whose ancestors brought the English drama to river towns in the south, when the traveled by flatboats before steam turned the paddle-wheels in this part of the country.  Theodore Hamilton, besides being the actor and the artist, is a genial, scholarly southern gentleman of the old school.  He was betimes a gallant and meritorious solider--one of the immortal paladins of the immortal Lee.</p>

<p>Monday and Tuesday night and at matinee Tuesday, Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" will be here.</p>
<p>The play deals with the folk of a little Missouri village, to which has come a lawyer named Dave Wilson, who by his quaint sayings and eccentricities has long been looked upon as a simpleton and dubbed "Pudd'nhead."  He is that kind of a lawyer to whom nobody will trust a case, but by his great fad of taking thumb impressions of different persons he is at least [sic] able to demonstrate his talents and win the greatest case the region has ever known.  The role of Pudd'nhead will be assumed by Mr. Theodore Hamilton.  Joseph Jefferson, Jr., son of the older Jefferson of "Rip Van Winkle" fame, supports Mr. Hamilton.  The Atlanta Constitution says:</p>

<p>The play "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the Lyceum may truthfully be said to be the best attraction offered by an Atlanta theater this year.  This may sound a bit strong, for Atlanta has had some very good attractions this year, but nothing like "Pudd'nhead Wilson" or the excellent company presenting it.  There is no more finished an actor on the stage than Theodore Hamilton, who takes the part of "Pudd'nhead."  This old veteran of the stage is one of the old school of actors and the actors that are made nowadays have not reached the perfection of Mr. Hamilton.  It is hard to imagine how any one could be better in the part.  Young Joe Jefferson shows remarkable ability in his part.  In the intensely dramatic climaxes he could not be excelled.  John Tucker, as Tom Driscoll, has a very hard and thankless part that he acts in a most artistic manner.  He has some of the hardest acting in the play and he does it in a most capable manner.  E. A. Locke, as the county sheriff, is life-like in his part.  He made a decided hit with the audience and deserved the applause accorded him.  Belle Stokes is a very charming little actress and is excellent in her part.  But to give sufficient praise to the company would be to take each one individually and dwell upon their merits.  Suffice it to say that the entire cast is excellent and it would be hard to improve on it.  As for the play of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," it is exactly like the book.  Mark Twain is in part of it almost.  His humor, his pathos make it a great play.  The story is too well known to repeat, but it is even more charming on the stage than it is in the book.  There is so much life in it, so much humor, so much that is good, ennobling and enjoyable in it that it may be classed among the best plays on the stage.  It is a play that lingers with you and as soon as the performance is concluded there is immediately a desire to see it again.</p>

<center><b>Dallas Opera-House.</b></center>

<p>Of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which is to be at the opera-house to-night, to-morrow matinee and to-morrow night, the New Orleans Times-Democrat says:</p>
<p>"'Pudd'nhead Wilson' was very warmly welcomed by a large Sunday-night audience at the Grand opera-house last night.  As most readers are familiar with Mark Twain's famous story, the theme of which is the exemplification of the moral superiority of the white race over the colored, it is hardly necessary to give even the barest outline of the plot of the play.  The story is unique and original, and the work of the dramatist (in this instance Frank Mayo) has been wonderfully well done.  Incidents are crowded into the play so densely that the play-goer fails to realize that upward of three hours have elapsed between the rise and final fall of the curtain.  The play tells a very complete and satisfactory, and at the same time thrillingly interesting, story.  From the rise of the curtain on the prologue until its final fall on the trial scene in the last act, the interest never flags for a single instant, and what is still better, the story works all the way through toward a single climax, which is not reached until just as the curtain is ready to fall on the last act.</p>

<p>"This is perhaps the only play that has been presented which in dealing with the question of negro character has not done more or less violence to the traditions and sentiments of southern people.  As a matter of fact, while an interesting story has been made to hinge upon the question of a taint of negro blood, this slight taint is made to cause the heir to a rich estate, who has had all the advantages of a costly education and luxurious surroundings, to become a thief, a would-be murderer, and to kidnap and sell his free mother into slavery to pay a heavy gambling debt which he had contracted while his foster brother of pure white origin grows up to be a brave, gallant and noble man, despite the fact that he has been brought up as a slave.  The play abounds in that rich vein of humor which long ago won fame and fortune for Mark Twain, and some of the pictures of quaint village life, as well as the characters, are wonderfully well drawn.  All in all, this play is one that should grow constantly and rapidly upon the liking of play-goers.  Mr. Theodore Hamilton, in the title role, did work which alone should be sufficient to place him high in the light of the most distinguished character actors of his day and generation.  He was humorous without at any time detracting from the dignity of the character, and in him it was easy to recognize the gentleman of brains, culture and refinement, bullied and over-awed by a little community of ignorant and narrow-minded villagers.  Like the man of brains and force of character, he rose to the importance of a grave situation in the face of a threatened wrong, and easily triumphed over his small-souled persecutors.  Mr. Hamilton's acting was at all times forceful and intelligent, and while neither broad comedy nor light comedy, many of his scenes were strikingly mirth-provoking.  Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., as Chambers, the white boy, whose manhood and natural courage and gallantry could not be dimmed by even the degrading associations and surroundings of slavery, created an excellent impression, and won long and enthusiastic bursts of applause in some of his stronger and more effective scenes.  Miss Margaret Hayward made an effective Roxy.  Miss Belle Stokes was pretty and pleasing as Rowy, and Miss Lillian Shovelin as Patsy is deserving of especial mention.  Mr. John Tucker made the most of the thankless part of Tom Driscoll, playing the character with such realism as to win the most flattering evidences of disapprobation from the gallery.  T. A. Locke, John E. Ince and William Hemsley all furnished excellent samples of character comedy work.  Augustus Halbach and C. N. Schaffer also gave a creditable interpretation of their characters."

<center><b>"Pudd'nhead Wilson."</b></center>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" which was presented at the opera-house last night came to our theater-goers, heralded by unqualified praise of artistic construction and the successions of triumphs that have attended its career.</p>
<p>The piece is complete and far-reaching and holds the mirror perfectly up to nature.  Let it be said in preliminary that there are many delicate strokes of dramatic genius in "Pudd'nhead Wilson," an analysis of which would confer no intellectual gain.</p>

<p>In "Pudd'nhead Wilson" Mark Twain has given room and verge enough for the exercise of varied histrionic talent, and has demonstrated his appreciation of the wants of the stage for home-like surroundings.  Farce comedy is groaning under a weary life, melo-drama has seen its palmiest days, and Shakespearean drama is a success only when interpreted by artists of transcendent ability.  The current of the public taste is drifting toward the less romantic drama.  Although it has been aptly said that actual life in most of its aspects is dull and tedious; that most persons are commonplace except at rare moments, and that it is the uncommon elements that invest humanity with abiding interest, it is doubtless true that the world of art has very little room for the commonplace.  Yet, ordinary life and seemingly insipid scenes frequently become positively refreshing when created under picturesque circumstances.  This is true of "Pudd'nhead Wilson."  There is an indescribable charm in the beauties of rural life and the very realistic features which are depicted by "Pudd'nhead Wilson."  It transports one from the busy, stirring, jostling scenes of ordinary practical life to a realm of quiet thought.  The element of human nature is freely wrought into the texture of the play, and it is to this that "Pudd'nhead" is considerably indebted for its essential charm and chief victory as a play attempting to naturally depict country village life and the exemplification of the moral superiority of the white race over the colored.  Mark Twain made no attempt to idealize human nature, nor did he strive for literary tinsel.  It was his purpose to tell a quiet, interesting story and show the triumph of good.  As most theater-goers are familiar with the famous story it is hardly necessary to give the barest essence of the outline of the plot.  It is simple and homely, yet absorbingly interesting, effective from commingled humor and pathos and wonderfully well drawn quaint characters.</p>

<p>In the rendition of the role of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," Mr. Theodore Hamilton, it would seem, gave to the eccentric character all the beautiful coloring that it required.  In it he is ungainly, green, unsophisticated, thoroughly honest, well educated, delicate, tender and lovable--a singular compound of awkward gallantry, serio-comic humor, homespun sense and refinement.  Mr. Hamilton has found in this a thoroughly congenial character, and he infuses into it a quick, sweet spirit, and treats it with a delicacy of touch, a correctness of conception that renders the character as gracious with inherent gentleness as it is droll with serio-comic humor.</p>

<p>Mr. E. A. Locke shared honors with Mr. Hamilton in the characterization of Sheriff Blake, a character that pervades the comedy and lights it up with quaint humor and good nature, absurd and ludicrous.  Mr. Locke is a master of that peculiar class of eccentric interpretation and sunny humor.</p>

<p>Joseph Jefferson, Jr., gave a remarkably clever interpretation of the character of the slave.  His conception in voice, bearing and gesture was refreshingly correct.</p>

<p>Miss Ellen Short, as Hannah, the slave; Miss Hayward, as Roxy, and Miss Schovelin, as Patsy, were very acceptable.</p>

<p>The performance altogether was an enjoyable piece of comedy.  The cast:</p>
