&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Drawing off gloves)</font><br />
Howard Pembroke, you see before you, sah, a perfectly happy man. I have been mightily perplexed for a long time, but now the last dollar is paid, and this estate is as free from encumbrance as the day my poor dead brother paid his cash for it.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Sits at table R. &ndash; L. of it)</font><br />
<br />

<center>Howard</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.)</font><br />
So I reckon now, your interest will keep you here in Missouri for a time.<br />
<br />
<center>Driscoll</center>
Yes, but my heart will always be in old Virginia.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Shakes hands    )</font><br />
The dear old dominion! Missouri is a fine state, sah, but it is not Virginia, but now you have settled here at Dawson, I shall not feel so quite alone.<br />
<br />
<center>Howard</center>
I reckon it will help us both bear our exile, York.<br />
<br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
And that project we have so often discussed, I reckon we can see our way clear to now.<br />
<br />
<center>Howard</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Settling and stretching out legs)</font><br />
You mean the establishment of a law practice here at Dawson?<br />
<br />



<center>Driscoll</center>

I beg your pardon, Pembroke. If you think I am too sanguine &ndash;<br />
<br />
<center>Howard</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Rises)</font><br />
No! I assure you I was not laughing at that &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Offers seat to York)</font><br /> 
&ndash; but while you were speaking I could not help but thinking of our neighbor, Wilson, "Pudd'nhead," as the boys about hyar call him. Ha, ha, ha!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Both laugh and sit)</font><br />
<br />
<center>Driscoll</center>
Now what brought him to your mind? I trust, sah, nothing I have said, for it is my impression that young man is not altogether right in his mind, hey?<br />
<br />
<center>Howard</center>
I reckon there's a crack somewhere. No, I was recalling his experience. He came hyar from York State, two years ago to practice law, says he hasn't had a case yet.<br />
<br />
<center>Driscoll</center>
Well &ndash; now &ndash; I don't reckon we class ourselves with Dave Wilson! And I don't apprehend his failure will influence you.<br />
<br />
<center>Howard</center>
Oh, not in the least &ndash; but &ndash;<br />

<center>Roxy</center>
Morning, Marse Pembroke.<br />

<br />
<center>Howard</center>
And when are you going to name your boy Roxy?<br />
<br />
<center>Roxy</center>
Don do dat a'ready, sah. Marse Wilson he done chris'n him.<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Oh, Wilson's his god-father, eh?<br />
<br />
<center>Howard</center>
What's his name?<br />
<br />

<center>Roxy</center>

<center>Roxy</center>
He don call him Valet de Chambers.<br /><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Howard and Driscoll laugh heartily &ndash; she saunters down C.)</font><br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
Not altogether inappropriate, if, as you say, York, he is to grow up to attend on his young master. Both born on the same day, I believe?<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
Yes, and a sad day it was; for it pleased Heaven at that time to take away my poor dear sister-in-law.<br /><br />

<center>Howard</center>
So Roxy, you have had the care of him as well as your own boy hey?<br /><br />

<center>Roxy</center>
Yes, Marse Pembroke.<br /><br />

A mighty fine pair of boys they are too.<br /><br />

I don't reckon you done see 'em more'n once or free time &ndash; ha, ha, ha!<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>
That's so! And do you know, Howard, I can't tell the youngsters apart, scarcely &ndash; except by their clothes &ndash; ha, ha, ha!<br /><br />

<center>Driscoll</center>

<center>Roxy</center>
No, not troublesome 'exactly, jes' kin'er discontented like, jes' if he wanted to have his own way &ndash; now, while he kin &ndash; may 'blong to some 'un else bime-by, don't done make so much noise den.<br /><br />

But t'ings are mighty unsartin' in this world. I 'member dose times two years ago when most of owners 'bout here lose all de niggers. Dar was ole Squire Blake, he lose everything, nigger, plantation and all. You 'member his yaller girl Susan, his only chile too &ndash; they say she was. He thought a heap of dat gal, but she sold, and sold down the river. Den deer was ole Squire Swan. Everyone of his hands go. You 'member what happened to his girl Caroline, and her two children. Dey was too young to be took from the mother, so they all sell in a lump, and on de way down de river she took her two children in her arms and made their grave and hers in the Mississippi. Dis fam'ly mighty near gwine dat time. Would I reckon if it hadn't been for you, Marse York. I don't reckon your brother ever die if hadn't been for does troubles. I don't reckon Marse Swan or Marse Blake ever count on den things happening.<br /><br />

Character. I dare say you have heard even here in your benighted midst that there are no two things precisely alike in this world. Well, the same truth applies to thumb marks. Every man, woman and child carries his individual mark from the cradle to the grave and that mark is there on the bowl of the thumb.<br /><br />
