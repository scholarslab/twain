<center><b>Grand Opera House.</b></center>

<p>An attraction which Manager Henry Greenwall is not ashamed to invite his friends to see, comes to the Grand Opera House to-night in the shape of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which proved a success in the metropolitan cities north last season, and is now on its initial tour through the south.  It will be presented by that excellent character actor, Theodore Hamilton, and a thoroughly competent company, and will be staged with the same attention to detail that made its production at the Herald Square Theatre, in New York, so noteworthy.  The story, as all those who have read Mark Twain's book know, is very entertaining, and the living pictures of a little corner of the south throw new light upon a people who have their being in Mayo's arrangement of Twain's odd conceit.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is just the sort of play to catch the fancy of the regular theatre goers, for it is far enough away from the conventional to be novel, and it is of the kind, too, to attract the occasional seat buyer for its suggestion of fiber makes him feel that the stage is not going to the dogs after all.  But as the players make this play, it is well to speak of the man who dominates the title role--Theodore Hamilton.  This artist, the boyhood friend of Edwin Booth, the playmate of John Sleeper Clarke, Maggie Mitchell and John E. Owens, the comrade in arms of many of the world's bravest soldiers--General Longstreet, Albert Sidney Johnston, Fitzhugh Lee, and others equally great, delineates Mark Twain's hero as only a true southerner can, giving to that character all those deft touches that makes its impersonation so positively effective.  The play will run throughout the week, with the usual matinees.</p>

<p>Frank Mayo's excellent dramatization of Mark Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," was presented last night at the Grand Opera House.  Mr. Theo. Hamilton, a player of the old school, appeared in the title role.  A good audience was present, and followed with interest the interesting incidents of the piece.  It is a pleasing study of a lovable personality and contains much simple wisdom, especially about thumb-marks and their value as evidence in law.  The plot follows very closely that of the novel, and while this is advantageous in the main, there are places where it conflicts with the requirements of first-rate stage craft.  For example, the two Italian noblemen are admirably contrasted in the book with the simple and rustic population of the small Missouri town in which the action is supposed to pass.  But on the stage they are not altogether congruous, and might just as well have given way to Americans.  It will be readily remembered that the story is, in brief, that of the successful effort of a country lawyer to detect the perpetrator of an attempted assassination.  In tracing the criminal he uses thumb-marks, and in the event, discovers incidentally that the man who has for years been supposed to be the son of the county judge is really a negro, while an alleged quadroon is actually a white man, entitled to the other's place.  Mr. Hamilton's assumption of this part was in every respect satisfactory.  He has the advantage of a physique especially well suited to the part.  His deep, rich voice drops easily and naturally into the low tone of Wilson's self-communings, or, as in the trial scene, peals forth with electrifying sonorousness.  Mr. Hamilton was especially fine in the scene where he discovers the identity of the would-be murderer.  For several minutes he does not speak, but his expressive face, bending over the tell-tale pieces of glass, with their precious markings, fully informs the audience what ideas were passing in his mind.  His speech in the last act was really thrilling, and the final denunciation of the real culprit elicited loud applause.  Mr. Hamilton's support is good.  Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr.'s, rendition of the part of Chambers being especially worthy of mention.  He played the part of the quadroon boy with much skill, never letting the dialect grow too marked, and in such scenes as that at the ruined mill, putting a good deal of fire into his acting.  Mr. Hilbach [sic] made a dignified York Driscoll.  The part of Tom Driscoll was very well taken by Mr. Tucker, who made the most of an unsympathetic role.  Miss Shovelin, as Aunt Patsy, and Miss Hayward as Roxy were good, and Miss Stokes, who gave a pretty and effective rendition of the role, was Rowy.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" will continue at the Grand Opera House during the balance of the week.</p>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" was very warmly welcomed by a large Sunday-night audience at the Grand opera-house last night.  As most readers are familiar with Mark Twain's famous story, the theme of which is the exemplification of the moral superiority of the white race over the colored, it is hardly necessary to give even the barest outline of the plot of the play.  The story is unique and original, and the work of the dramatist (in this instance Frank Mayo) has been wonderfully well done.  Incidents are crowded into the play so densely that the play-goer fails to realize that upward of three hours have elapsed between the rise and final fall of the curtain.  The play tells a very complete and satisfactory, and at the same time thrillingly interesting, story.  From the rise of the curtain on the prologue until its final fall on the trial scene in the last act, the interest never flags for a single instant, and what is still better, the story works all the way through toward a single climax, which is not reached until just as the curtain is ready to fall on the last act.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the only play that has been presented which in dealing with the question of negro character has not done more or less violence to the traditions and sentiments of southern people.  As a matter of fact, while an interesting story has been made to hinge upon the question of a taint of negro blood, this slight taint is made to cause the heir to a rich estate, who has had all the advantages of a costly education and luxurious surroundings, to become a thief, a would-be murderer, and to kidnap and sell his free mother into slavery to pay a heavy gambling debt which he had contracted while his foster brother of pure white origin grows up to be a brave, gallant and noble man, despite the fact that he has been brought up as a slave.  The play abounds in that rich vein of humor which long ago won fame and fortune for Mark Twain, and some of the pictures of quaint village life, as well as the characters, are wonderfully well drawn.  All in all, this play is one that should grow constantly and rapidly upon the liking of play-goers.  Mr. Theodore Hamilton, in the title role, did work which alone should be sufficient to place him high in the light of the most distinguished character actors of his day and generation.  He was humorous without at any time detracting from the dignity of the character, and in him it was easy to recognize the gentleman of brains, culture and refinement, bullied and over-awed by a little community of ignorant and narrow-minded villagers.  Like the man of brains and force of character, he rose to the importance of a grave situation in the face of a threatened wrong, and easily triumphed over his small-souled persecutors.  Mr. Hamilton's acting was at all times forceful and intelligent, and while neither broad comedy nor light comedy, many of his scenes were strikingly mirth-provoking.  Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., as Chambers, the white boy, whose manhood and natural courage and gallantry could not be dimmed by even the degrading associations and surroundings of slavery, created an excellent impression, and won long and enthusiastic bursts of applause in some of his stronger and more effective scenes.  Miss Margaret Hayward made an effective Roxy.  Miss Belle Stokes was pretty and pleasing as Rowy, and Miss Lillian Shovelin as Patsy is deserving of especial mention.  Mr. John Tucker made the most of the thankless part of Tom Driscoll, playing the character with such realism as to win the most flattering evidences of disapprobation from the gallery.  T. A. Locke, John E. Ince and William Hemsley all furnished excellent samples of character comedy work.  Augustus Halbach and C. N. Schaffer also gave a creditable interpretation of their characters.</p>

<p>An admirable play, well acted, is "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which was repeated again to an appreciative audience at the Grand Opera House last night, with Theodore Hamilton in the title role.  The attention to detail, the excellent cast, and the appropriate scenery and costumes make this a notable production.  It is a treat to see so many legitimate, old time actors--real actors--as are in the cast of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," aside from Theodore Hamilton, the star, who has played in New Orleans many times before, and who was actor and manager here during the season that John E. Owens directed the fortunes of the Grand Opera House for La Varietie Association.  John E. Ince, of the cast, was a popular "Our Boarding School" star here years ago, and has played Chinamen here with as much favor as was ever granted to Chas. T. Parsloe, for similar work.  Mr. Ed. A. Locke, in the cast, brings back memories of the days when he was a dashing young comedian for Lotta, in the long ago.  There is in the cast also a chip of the old block which is sound yet, young Joseph Jefferson, Jr.  The company is a good one.  It is managed by Master Frank Chapman, whose ancestors brought the English drama to river towns in the south, when they traveled by flatboats before steam turned paddle-wheels in this part of the country.</p>

<p>Theodore Hamilton, besides being the actor and the artist, is a genial, scholarly southern gentleman of the old school.  He was betimes a gallant and meritorious soldier--one of the immortal paladins of the immortal Lee.  His cordial invitation to his old comrades to visit him at his rooms at the Commercial Hotel, the Item knows will be warmly responded to, and the old soldiers of the Southern Cross will enjoy a chat with one who has served faithfully a cause that called to battle a host of the brightest and best of the southland--and among them no truer heart than that of Theodore Hamilton, of the Eighth Virginia Cavalry.</p>

<p>Theodore Hamilton and a co. of distinguished actors were seen at the Grand Opera House 9-16 in Pudd'nhead Wilson.  Aside from the merits of this play of the Southland, which has been received favorably everywhere, the co. consists of fine actors whose fame is a guarantee for a first-class performance.  Theodore Hamilton, the star, is well acquainted here, and is remembered as an actor, and manager of the Grand Opera House some twenty years ago.  John E. Ince, another old-timer, is in the co., as is also Ed A. Locke, at one time leading comedian with Lotta.</p>
