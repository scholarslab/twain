        <center><b><font size="+1">THEODORE HAMILTON</font><br />
AND HIS COMPANY GIVE A SPENDID PRESENTATION OF "PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."</b></center>

<p>Certainly the theatre goers of Lexington were last night treated to the most excellent character acting ever witnessed on the local stage.  Theodore Hamilton and his very proficient company's production of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" was humorous in the extreme.  The scene, laid in a little Missouri village, gave great scope for such a talented character actor as Hamilton, and to say that he did the part full justice would be putting it mildly.  As the genial, kind hearted Missouri country lawyer, considered by his townsmen and friends too much of an idiot to be entrusted with a case in their local court, and somewhat of a crank on the study of thumb impressions, which, by the way, he puts to good advantage in his first case, and for which he was nicknamed "Pudd'nhead" by his associates, he was pronounced a success.</p>

<p>Mr. Jos. Jefferson, Jr., was seen for the first time in Lexington, in the character of Chambers, the nephew of York Driscoll, but for a number of years supposed to be the illegitimate son of the negress Roxy, and made a very favorable impression.</p>

<p>The audience was, during the fourth act, convulsed with laughter at the droll character of Sheriff Blake, portrayed by E. A. Lock, and the typical country jury.  Mr. Hamilton is to be congratulated on his selection of people to take the parts of the leading jurors.  A more motley array of country jurymen could not easily be gotten together, and Mr. Lock's rendition of the country sheriff was simply perfect.  He has surely at some past day filled this important appearing office in real life to be able to render the part as perfectly as he does.</p>

<p>Those who fail to see tonight's performance will be the losers, and it is to be hoped that the Lexington public will show its appreciation of good acting by packing the opera house to its capacity.  For those who attend a treat is in store.</p>
