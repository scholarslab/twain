<p>Theodore Hamilton and a co. of distinguished actors were seen at the Grand Opera House 9-16 in Pudd'nhead Wilson.  Aside from the merits of this play of the Southland, which has been received favorably everywhere, the co. consists of fine actors whose fame is a guarantee for a first-class performance.  Theodore Hamilton, the star, is well acquainted here, and is remembered as an actor, and manager of the Grand Opera House some twenty years ago.  John E. Ince, another old-timer, is in the co., as is also Ed A. Locke, at one time leading comedian with Lotta.</p>
