<p>THE VENDOME.--The story of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," from the facile pen of Mark Twain, has lost much of its interest to those who have read it, by a dramatic version from even so talented a man as Mr. Frank Mayo.  Some parts of the story are improved by the dramatist, and decidedly so when embodied in the person of a finished actor.  This is true of the comedy parts.  In the original story there produced only a smile, seldom a laugh, from an intelligent reader.  Rightfully and faithfully presented, more perfect humor cannot be found to titillate the nearly always dormant risibilities of humanity.  For the rest of the story only a consummate actor could approximately reproduce the effect which the reading of the story has.</p>

<p>The story itself and drama are not true to life.  Mark Twain has attempted to depict Southern life as it was before the war.  In this he has shot wide of his mark and has given us a story that, with all of its simplicity and perfect delineation of certain characters--namely, Pudd'nhead and Sheriff Blake--is revolting to a cavalier.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is well known to the reading public, and a sketch of its plot would, perhaps, be superfluous here, but there are certain features of the story that have received unusual prominence at the hands of the dramatist, which made but little impression on the minds of the general reader.  It is these in the drama that make it unsavory.  What are they?  It is the giving to the slave a position that he did not hold, and the elevation of the "white nigger" to the degradation of his master and mistress.</p>

<p>In slave times the young ladies of the South were not in the habit, nor did they ever, make a companion of a man slave.  Mark Twain has it that way, and Mr. Mayo adds to the insult by giving us a young lady who is not only the companion of a "white nigger," but shows that she has an affection for him, as if he were her equal.  Rowy did not know that Chambers was not a slave, and it frequently develops that her associations with him had caused the rustics to suspect a scandal.</p>

<p>Roxy, the slave girl-mother, with only one-sixteenth negro blood, on whose act of changing the babies on the morning of the christening the denouement rests, and is finally unveiled by the thumb marks, is an over-drawn character, both in the story and in the drama.  She is given entirely too prominent a position, one that she nor any other slave woman ever held.  Her child is the child of her master, consequently, by illegitimacy, the cousin of her master's nephew, who is the scoundrel of the story.</p>

<p>A limited audience greeted Mr. Theodore Hamilton and company last night.  This company met with great success in the West, and one would have thought its reception here would have taken a more cordial turn.  The drama was well presented, and, barring its unrealities, was as pleasant a performance as has been seen here this year.  Mr. Hamilton, as Pudd'nhead, gave an intelligent rendition of that character.  His droll ways, quaint humor and simple abandon were very pleasing to the audience.  Mr. E. A. Locke, as Sheriff Blake, was what Artemus Ward would call an "amoosin' cuss."  Whenever he moved, whenever he parted his lips, whenever he looked at you, it was in a comical way.  He added no little to the merits of the performance.</p>

<p>Beyond these two the other members of the cast deserve praise for faithful, creditable and intelligent work.  There were times when more capable actors would have added to the intensity of the scene, especially was this true at the climax, which detracts much from the play as a whole.  There will be a matinee and a night performance to-day.</p>
