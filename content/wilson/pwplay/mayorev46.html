        <center><b>MAYO IN "PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."<br />
Coming to Olympia Tuesday Evening Next.</b></center>
<p>The announcement that Mark Twain's famous play "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is to be presented at the Olympia theater on Tuesday evening, December 6, will awaken the interest of our best amusement lovers.  This is one of the very finest companies on the road.  It numbers twenty three people and is headed by that admirable actor, Edwin Mayo, the lifelike son of the late Frank Mayo.  It is the same cast that played for months at the Herald's Square theater, New York City, and it is safe to say that they will bring out the largest and most refined audience of the season.  Seats will be placed on sale at O'Connor's on Saturday at 9 a.m., and it is a foregone conclusion that they will be in big demand.</p>

        <center><b>MAYO IN "PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."<br />
Remarkable Success Attained by This Clever Actor.</b></center>
<p>When Frank Mayo took his departure from this earth nearly three years ago it was thought at the time that "Pudd'nhead Wilson" had died with him, but such was not the case, for his son Edwin took up the work he had laid down, and from all accounts, has been equally successful in his portrayal of the loveable old character "Pudd'nhead," which will no doubt live and be popular with the people for years to come.  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" is a grand play and like "Rip Van Winkle," "The Old Homestead" and "Shore Acres" is bound to be long-lived.  This season, so far, we are told, has been even more successful in the history of the play.</p>

        <center><b>A SCIENTIFIC STUDY.<br />
What "Pudd'nhead Wilson" as Staged Amounts To.</b></center>
<p>Probably no American play ever created more interest among scientists than has "Pudd'nhead Wilson," and yet even the most careless thinker cannot fail to be impressed with the logical and interesting developments of the theory of "thumb marks" as a means of personal identification as depicted in the last two acts of Mark Twain's great story.  It is seldom that a purely scientific subject has been so interestingly and coherently treated.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the most extensive study of the theory of "thumb marks," has been made by Francis Galton, F.R.S., the English scientist.  Chiefly on the testimony of his investigation the "thumb mark" theory has lately been adopted as a means of criminal identification in England.  He claims that there are no two in the world alike.  It is upon this that Mark Twain has founded the remarkable story of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," and which has been so skillfully dramatized by the late Frank Mayo, that it has taken its place among the classics.</p>

        <center><b>"PUDD'NHEAD WILSON" TONIGHT<br />
A Great Production at Olympia Theater This Evening.</b></center>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson," Mark Twain's great story as dramatized by Frank Mayo will be seen tonight at Olympia theater.  The company producing the play is one of those high-salaried organizations such as we find only in productions of this kind.  With two or three exceptions the cast is the same that played the piece during its long run at the Herald Square theater, New York, and the coming engagement here of this high class entertainment will no doubt bring out one of the largest and most representative audiences of the season.</p>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson"  is one of the most quaintly costumed plays that we have ever seen.  The play in itself is a classic.  The story, which is founded upon the theory that there are no two "thumb marks" in the world alike, dates back to the early part of the present century and brings to view the old fashioned hoop-skirts, stove-pipe hats, cutaway coats, tight trousers, ruffled shirts and other fashions that appear strange enough to people whose memories do not go back to that period.  To make sure that there should be nothing modern connected with the production, to mar the consistency of this beautiful picture, Mr. Mayo carries all his own effects, even to as small a thing as a newspaper which was published in St. Louis in 1836.</p>
