<p>Probably one of the most interesting announcements of the season is that Frank Mayo will open to-night (6th) at the Detroit Opera House for a three nights' engagement in his much-talked-of and much-lauded Pudd'nhead Wilson. We anticipate a genuine treat if accounts from the East are to be relied upon.</p>
