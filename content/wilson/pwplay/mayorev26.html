        <center><b>Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson" at the New National Theater.</b></center>

<p>Mark Twain is certainly a remarkable man. Time was when we regarded him as only a humorist--the king of his kind, to be sure, but still "only a humorist," with that half patronizing expression with which every one speaks of a man who makes us laugh, be he a comedian of the stage or of the world of letters. True this same comedian may be our superior mentally; most likely he is, for the gift of humor is one of the rarest. Any fool may draw a long face, and by keeping quiet or uttering only axioms and commonplaces in profound style, may pass for a wise man; but only a wise man may play the fool with impunity.</p>
<p>When the genial author of "Innocents Abroad," "Roughing It," "Tom Sawyer," &amp;c., essayed to be serious, he made us smile more than ever. It was like Nat Goodwin playing "Richard III"--not that Nat could not play Richard if he had a chance, but we simply would not have him in a serious role. But since Mark Twain wrote anonymously the memoirs of Jean d'Arc, we begin to appreciate the inherent strength of his writings. Still more do we appreciate the dramatic possibilities of "Pudd'nhead Wilson," that droll sketch from life in the Southwest, which Frank Mayo made into a real American drama. Most people have smiled over the quaint character sketches of the story, and appreciated its pointed satire on slavery, but to realize its dramatic power they should see the play.</p>
<p>Dear old Frank Mayo has passed away, but "Pudd'nhead Wilson," his latest creation, was welcomed at the National last evening by a large and enthusiastic audience, including such distinguished people as President Cleveland, Secretaries Olney, Lamont, Morton, and Postmaster General Wilson. All seemed to enjoy the play to the utmost, and even those who had seen it before, with Mr. Mayo in the title role, said that, although they missed him, the performance was as good or better than ever. Most of the favorites of the former cast have been retained, save him whom death took away, and his part is acceptably filled by  that sterling actor of the same school as Mr. Mayo, Theodore Hamilton.</p>
<p>Indeed, it may be said that, had Frank Mayo not originated the role, Mr. Hamilton's Pudd'nhead Wilson would be a creation. As it is, his impersonation accentuates and brings out some points of the character more clearly than Mr. Mayo's. While we miss that genial humor of Mayo in the comedy scenes, in the dramatic scenes, especially the trial, Mr. Hamilton is superb. At any rate the play is worth seeing for its own sake, and the cast throughout is good.</p>
<p>Frank Aiken is seen in his old role of York Driscoll; Arnold Daly is Chambers again, and Newton Chisnell is still seen in his amusing creation of Blake, the county sheriff. Frank Campeau plays the bogus Tom Driscoll in good style; Frank Currier is the pompous country lawyer, while Messrs. Edward Lee and Macey Harlam realize the twins, Luigi and Angelo. William Gill and J. P. Tucker play the low comedy parts of Swan and Campbell.</p>
<p>The ladies of the cast remain the same, and could scarcely be improved upon. They are Eleanor Moretti as Roxy, Lucille La Verne as Aunt Patsy, and Frances Graham Mayo as Rowy. "Pudd'nhead" will play all week, with usual matinees.</p>

<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson, in the title-role of which Theodore Hamilton makes a conspicuous success, opened to a very excellent house at Rapley's New National Theatre. Many of the original cast were seen in the presentation, including Eleanor Morrett, Frances Graham, Lucille La Verne, Frank B. Aiken, Newton Chisnell, Frank currier, Frank Champeau, Arnold Daly, W. S. Gill, and J. P. Tucker. Francis Wilson in Half a King comes comes next.</p>
