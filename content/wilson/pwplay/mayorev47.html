        <center><b>"PUDD'NHEAD WILSON."</b></center>

<p>Since the death of Frank Mayo nearly three years ago, the character  "Pudd'nhead Wilson" which comes to the Tacoma theater on Wednesday night has been in the hands of his talented son, Edwin, and according to the Eastern newspapers, the son's success in the part has been fully as great as that of his noble sire, whom we all loved and respected, both as a man and an artist, while of the play we can honestly say that it is one of the best (thanks to the late elder Mayo) that this country has ever turned out and so long as it is kept in the hands of the present company, which by the way is composed mostly of the original supporting cast, it is bound to live and succeed for years to come.</p>

<p>In passing criticism on Mr. Mayo's performance the Minneapolis Daily Times of Oct. 31st, 1898, has the following to say:</p>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson," whom many of us have known as we know hundreds of other creations of an author's fancy, stepped out of the covers of the book and appeared on the stage of the Metropolitan theater last evening, a living being and an old friend.  It is adequate praise for the play to say that the book has lost nothing in its dramatization.  Frank Mayo has done his work well, and the large audience present could find no words with which to express their appreciation.  It is a decidedly unusual circumstance to see a company appearing at the Metropolitan tendered triple curtain calls at the close of every act, and yet that was the reception accorded Edwin Mayo and his company.  Seldom has a play made a more favorable first impression, and not since the presentation of the "Sign of the Cross," last season, has the Metropolitan contained so thoroughly delighted an audience.</p>

<p>The coming to this city next Wednesday evening at the Tacoma theater of Edwin Mayo in Mark Twain's remarkable play, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," which has been so skillfully dramatized by Frank Mayo, will no doubt bring out the largest audience of the season.</p>
