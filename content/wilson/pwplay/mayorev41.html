<p>That master of stage craft--Frank Mayo--in dramatizing Mark Twain's quaint and humorous story of Pudd'nhead Wilson, gave to the reading public a new and a better interpretation of the quiet pettifogging Missourian than Twain in his most enthusiastic moments, ever dreamed that character capable of.  Yet it remains for the actor who plays the part to so impress it upon the mind and heart of his auditors that they upon leaving the play house stamp his delineation with the verdict of greatness.  Such high praise does not befall every artist; but if all that has been said about Theodore Hamilton's rendition of Pudd'nhead Wilson be true, then that scholarly Southerner has attained a position near the topmost rung on the ladder of fame.  Competent critics proclaim Mr. Hamilton's work to be simple, natural and unexaggerated, surrounding his utterances with the poetry of nature so soothing in its well mellowed shades that it sets the hearts aflame with love and makes his hearers declare that Pudd'nhead Wilson, is one of the most beautiful and idylic characterizations ever seen upon the stage.  This charming play will be presented here with the same elaborate production that made its run in New York so successful.  Mr. Hamilton will be ably supported by Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., son of Joseph Jefferson the eminent comedian, and an excellent company.</p>

<p>On Thursday next there will be presented upon our local play board for the first time in this city Frank Mayo's dramatization of Mark Twain's quaint and humorous work Pudd'nhead Wilson, with that eminent Southern character actor Theodore Hamilton in the title role.  Of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" the Metropolitan press have written the highest ecomiums comparing it to "Shore Acres," and "The Old Homestead," stating that it is an idyl of the South where they are an epitome of New England life.  There is said to be much heart interest in "Pudd'nhead Wilson" and a quaint and quiet humor that permeates its entire being; comedy and pathos being said to so richly blend, laughter chasing away tears so rapidly that the beholder often wonders why his eyes are moist.  Mr. Hamilton will play Pudd'nhead, a role for which nature seems to have eminently fitted him.  His interpretation of that quaint kind hearted Missourian is said to reach right into the inmost tendrils of your heart and hold you in sympathetic touch with his life's work--that of righting a great wrong.  Mr. Hamilton will have as an able second, Mr. Joseph Jefferson, Jr., (son of the greatest comedian of this age) and other actors of note.</p>

<p>There is coming to this city next Thursday an attraction that will surely hold the rapt attention of our theatre goers both from a literary and a dramatic standpoint.  The play in question is Pudd'nhead Wilson, Frank Mayo's dramatization of Mark Twain's novel of that name and its enactment is in the hands of Theodore Hamilton, Joseph Jefferson, Jr., (son of the dash of the American stage) and other artists of equal note.  The story of the piece, as all who have read Twain's work know, is laid in a sleepy, drowsy corner of Missouri where ignorance is bliss and a self satisfied air with everything in general reigns.  The theme hinges upon the substitution of a one-thirty-second part negro child for a white boy, but through the preservation of the thumb marks of both children by a quaint kind hearted Pudd'nhead lawyer.</p>
<p>The wrongs of the concession are eventually righted and the white boy now at man's estate comes to his inheritance.  This play affords considerable character studies in it shows the very life depictations of scenes that have actually happened.</p>

<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson which will be presented at the Academy tonight by Mr. Theodore Hamilton and a strong company, has held its own as one of the best plays made from contemporary novels.  A large proportion of the theatre goers of this city are also readers of magazines, and no doubt are familiar with Mark Twain's clever novel, and there should be a strong desire to witness the dramatization of his work.  The play follows the outline of the story and condenses it into a prologue and four acts.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton, who assumes the title role in Pudd'nhead Wilson is better known in the Southern than in the Northern states, although he has been associated nearly all his life with the most prominent actors.</p>

        <center><b>AN ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION.<br />
Full House Delighted With Pudd'nhead Wilson.</b></center>

<p>The "Pudd'nhead Wilson" company played to one of the best houses of the season last night and it is not too high praise to say the company redeemed the promises made in the advance notices.  The play, to begin with, has some body to it, is a very good dramatization of Mark Twain's story, and can boast the unusual luxury of a plot.  It is in an entirely different class from those plays where the minister suddenly bursts out in comic song and capers to his own music.  There were no cheap or dirty "specialities."  The get up of the characters was excellent and the parts were well sustained throughout.</p>

<p>With one exception it was far and away the best play of the season.</p>

<p>Hamilton as "Pudd'nhead" captured the audience and the other leading characters were almost equally well received.</p>

<p>Music by the Greensboro orchestra.</p>
