<p>For the present week the house is presenting Pudd'nhead Wilson by a very fine co., with Frank Mayo at the head. The play is one of the best that has been given by the Coates management this season, and Mr. Mayo's conception of the part of Wilson is very natural to life. Miss Moretti, who plays the part of Roxy, gives an extremely good version of the slave girl. Frank Campeau as Tom Driscoll, Arnold Daly as Chambers, Frank Aiken as Judge Driscoll, Miss Laverne as Patsy, and Frances Grahame as Rowy all rendered their parts very acceptably. In fact, the whole co has a make-up that produces a very finished play. Fanny Davenport in Giamonda Follows.</p>
