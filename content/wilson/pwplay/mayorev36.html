        <center><b>Edwin Mayo in 'Pudd'nhead Wilson.'</b></center>

<p>The delicate task of transplanting the quaint humor and the absorbing human interest of Mark Twain's narrative to the stage has been admirably accomplished by Frank Mayo in the drama of "Pudd'nhead Wilson."  It is no simple matter, as many an adapter has found, to pluck the heart out of even the most dramatic story and set it palpitating anew on the stage--so different is the machinery used by the novelist from that of the dramatist.  The latter must compress the story rigorously within the narrow limits of four or five acts, until from the powerful compression to which it was been subjected it crystalizes like a gem in the crucible of nature.  Frank Mayo, himself an actor of wide experience, brought to his task the technical ability necessary for success and produced on the basis of Mark Twain's great story a great play.  And while it deals with the race problem as it existed in the south in ante-bellum days, it is in no sense a "problem play"--the rights and wrongs of the mixed blood are not discussed, but rather accepted as they were then accepted, and used to furnish the motif for an absorbing story.  But perhaps the most wonderful thing about the play is the fidelity with which Twain's characters are taken from the book and made to live and breathe as if real.  One feels that one has really met "Pudd'nhead" and Sheriff Blake and Major Swan and all the other deliciously quaint old fellows of Lawson's Landing.</p>
<p>This brings us to the consideration that not a whit less than the adapter are the actors in this really fine production responsible for the fidelity of the characterization.  Never were a set of play people better suited by nature and by education for the parts they are called on to play.  One looks in vain for a weak spot and finds it difficult to realize, for instance, that "Pudd'nhead" Wilson is really Edwin Mayo.  This character naturally stands out most clearly, though by no means the only one that is carefully and naturally limned.  The lazy, good-natured drawl of the lovable old fellow  has served as a mask for many years to conceal his keen wit and his remarkable penetration from the simple folk of Lawson.  His thumb mark hobby which has caused them to smile with pitying derision for many years finally proves to be the key that unlocks the mystery.  In such a trying moment as that in which the great discovery slowly dawns on him, Mr. Mayo demonstrates his power and truth.  His performance is a wonderfully finished and satisfying one, perfect in small details, powerful in general effect.</p>

<p>Quite as forceful and faithful in its way is the Roxy of Miss Ada Dwyer, whose wide-mouthed, musically-rippling laugh is so characteristically negroid and whose every gesture and word give evidence of deep and absorptive study of the mulatto character.  Ralph Dean as Chambers, her supposed son, is fully equal to a most difficult role which he handles with unexaggerated simplicity.  Frank Campeau does equally well with the opposite role of the real son, who has been palmed off as all white.  He is really an original villain with methods as effective as they are unstereotyped.  The audience narrowly escaped hysteria every time Sheriff Blake (W. R. McKey) opened his mouth or indulged in that inimitable, bucolic strut.  They were in almost as great danger when Swan (Wm. R. Gill) and Campbell (Wm. Arthur) indulged in their perspicuous and gesticulatory arguments.  These characters were admirable.  So, too, were the Italian twins (Willard Curtis and Louis Wasself) who seem so strangely out of place in the old Missouri river town.  Charles J. Edmunds as Judge Driscoll, and Augustus Balfour as Lawyer Pembroke were doubtless true to life, but the characters lack the interest attaching to the less cultured and more natural sons of the soil.  Little Miss Maribel Seymour was dainty and convincing as Rowey and Miss D. Delaro as "Pudd'nhead's" widowed sister was entirely adequate.  In short, without further particularising, it is sufficient to repeat that the company is fitted to the play like a glove to the hand.  More could not be said. &nbsp; &nbsp; --W. B. C.</p>

<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson," whom many of us have known as we know hundreds of other creations of an author's fancy, stepped out of the covers of the book and appeared on the stage of the Metropolitan theater last evening, a living being and an old friend.  It is adequate praise for the play to say that the book has lost nothing in its dramatization.  Frank Mayo has done his work well, and the large audience present could find no words with which to express their appreciation.  It is a decidedly unusual circumstance to see a company appearing at the Metropolitan tendered triple curtain calls at the close of every act, and yet that was the reception accorded Edwin Mayo and his company.  Seldom has a play made a more favorable first impression, and not since the presentation of the "Sign of the Cross," last season, has the Metropolitan contained so thoroughly delighted an audience.</p>

<p>At the Metropolitan Theatre Pudd'nhead Wilson was presented for the first time in this city Oct. 30 to a fair-sized and delighted audience.  Rarely, if ever, has the first performance of any play upon the local stage been received with such marked demonstrations of approval.  Triple curtain calls marked the close of every act.  Edwin Mayo, Frank Campeau, Ralph Dean, Charles J. Edmunds, Augustus Balfour, and Ada Dwyer contributed largely to the enjoyment of the performance.</p>

<p> . . . The annual benefit of the Minneapolis Press Club was given at the Lyceum Theatre afternoon of 27, before a large and brilliant audience.  The programme, which was replete with clever specialties, included a brief address by Red Blanket and Kay-Gway-ge-Way-be-Nung, representatives from the Chippewa tribe of Indians at Leech Lake, Minn., the scene of the recent disturbance.  Volunteers assisted from the Pudd'nhead Wilson, What Happened to Jones, Muldoon's Picnic, and Dorothy Morton opera companies.  The performance concluded with a series of artistic living pictures.</p>
