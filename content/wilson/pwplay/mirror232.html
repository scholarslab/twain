<p>Owing probably to the big counter attraction of the championship hockey match, the audience on the opening night of Pudd'nhead Wilson was slim; this is to be regretted, as the performance is one of the best that has been seen in the Academy this season.  Edwin Mayo again gives his clever portrayal of the title role.  Frances G. Mayo is as charming as ever as Rowey, and Frank Campeau repeats his success as the villainous Tom Driscoll.  Nina Morris essayed the role of Roxy for the first time 12, and scored an emphatic hit, it was hard to believe that she had not been playing the part for the whole season.  The other characters were in capable hands.</p>
