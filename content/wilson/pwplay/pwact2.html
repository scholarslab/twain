&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
Is that not a singular term to apply to one of your most prominent citizens? How did he acquire it?<br /><br />

A dog?<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Swan and Campbell begin listening to the conversation)</font><br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Yes. You see the first day he arrived here, Wilson's from York State, we &ndash; that is some of the choice spirits of the place &ndash; were giving him a kind of welcome at the tavern. Our conversation was seriously disturbed by the unearthly barking of a dog. Many objections were made to the nuisance, but without effect. Until finally Pudd'nhead remarked that he 'lowed he'd like to own half that dog.<br /><br />

<center>Luiji and Angelo</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Laugh)</font><br />
Half the dog?<br />

There.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Campbell and Swan come down R.L. Blake C.)</font><br />
That's it. You've said it. Just like we did more than 20 years ago. Didn't we?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Campbell and Swan smile and nod)</font><br /><br />


<center>Angelo</center>
Said what?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Half a dog.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Swan and Campbell laugh)</font><br />
Now gentlemen &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(To twins)</font><br />
&ndash; can you understand any reason for a perfectly sane man wanting to own half a dog? Can you?<br /><br />

<center>Luiji</center>
Was it a valuable dog?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
Valuable? No, the durndest meanest low down cur in the country, sir. Wasn't he?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Swan and Campbell nod)</font><br /><br />


<center>Luiji</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.C.)</font><br />
What reason did Mr. Wilson give for wanting to own half of it?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Because he 'lowed he'd like to kill his half.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Luiji and Angelo laugh heartily. The others laugh with sort of triumph and appeal to one another with great satisfaction)</font><br />

<center>Blake</center>
What if it had been a valuable dog? Would that have made any difference? What did the durn fool reckon would become of the other half? Did he reckon it would live?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Angelo and Luiji laugh heartily)</font><br />
<br />

<center>Swan</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(R.C. &ndash; earnestly)</font><br />
Must 'o reckon so. Else why didn't he want to own the entire dog? Cos, don't you see, if he killed his half and the other half did die he would be responsible wouldn't he?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Course he would. Any court would allow damages.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(To twins)</font><br />
Don't it appear like that way to you gentlemen?<br /><br />

<center>Luiji</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L. C.)</font><br />
It is certainly a very perplexing question.<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(C.)</font><br />
Been a matter of debate here for most a quarter of a century sir.<br /><br />

<center>Angelo</center>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(L.)</font><br />
And does Mr. Wilson still maintain his side of the question?<br /><br />

<center>Blake</center>
As a religion, sir. Good afternoon gentlemen.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Looks at watch and goes toward R.U.E.)</font><br />

Well it's allus been clear enough to me &ndash; 'cos, don't you see &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Blake stops in the door R.U.E.)</font><br />
&ndash; if it had been a gineral dog&ndash; and he owned half &ndash; it would be just the same, wouldn't it?   &ndash; and particularly in the first
 case &ndash; 'cos &ndash; don't you see &ndash; if you kill one end of a gineral dog there ain't no man can tell whose end it were &ndash;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Pause)</font><br />

No he couldn't, and not be responsible if the other end died &ndash; which of course it would, wouldn't it gentlemen?<br />

Well, one day Chambers and I were playing down on the end of the pier, when all of a sudden, way up
 on the levee, we heard Tom calling for help.  Tom was in a fight, you know he always made Chambers do his fighting.  Well Chambers had left his hat and coat in the little shed at the end of the pier &ndash; when he heard Tom call &ndash; gimminy &ndash; you should have seen him jump.<br /><br />

Who, Chambers?<br /><br />

<center>Rowy</center>
Yes. Well he made for the shed to get his hat and coat. First I thought I would like to see the fight. Then I changed my mind. I grabbed Chambers' hat and coat, pushed him back into the shed and locked the door. Then I put them on and sat out on the end of the pier pretending I was fishing. When down comes Tom, tearing and cussing like sin. I sat there laughing fit to kill. Tom taking me for Chambers cussed more, and standing right behind me shouted, You infernal white nigger you, why didn't you come when I called you! Then all at once he up and kicked me into the river.<br />

If you had felt Tom's boot, as I did, you wouldn't think so. I could swim a little, but Chambers coat got so heavy &ndash; I caught hold of one of the logs and held on &ndash; I felt my strength going and that it was the last of me &ndash; but I remembered a splash and then an arm around me and I was gone. I never knew what happened after that until I found myself on the floor back of the shed and Chambers weeping over me like a baby, and he told me to tell the Judge that Tom had saved me.<br /><br />

A valuable knife had been presented to my brother by an Italian Prince. A native servant whom we employed becoming aware of its value one night slipped into our room. A dim light was burning. Angelo was asleep, but fortunately I was awake. I saw the vague figure creeping towards our bed. I slipped by hand under the pillow and drew the knife from its sheath. I was not a minute too soon for the figure of the man arose at my brother's side, bent over him with an uplifted dagger, aimed at his throat. Quicker than it takes to tell I was upon him and my knife was in his heart. That is the whole story and just as it was foretold by the palmist.<br /><br />
