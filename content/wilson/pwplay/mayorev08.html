Puddin'head Wilson Makes a Hit at the Wheeler</b>
       </center>


<p>Puddin'head Wilson as portrayed by Frank Mayo at the Wheeler opera house last evening won the hearts of the largest audience of the season. There is humor and pathos intermixed in the play that is indescribable, but it is of that pleasant sort that grows with acquaintance. The story of Puddin'head deals with life along the banks of the big river in Missouri as it existed years ago. Interesting Puddin'head will always be and could the people of Aspen become acquainted with it they would fill the theater night after night to enjoy its many and varied beauties. It is a story of antebellum days and a beautiful story too. The company with Mr. Mayo is a strong one in every respect.</p>
