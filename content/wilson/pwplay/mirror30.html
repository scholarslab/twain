<p>[from] THE USHER.</p>

<p>The press and personal tributes to Frank Mayo, whose death has inspired sincere expressions of regret on all sides, have illustrated the esteem in which that admired actor was held professionally and as a man.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayo was not alone an artist. He was large-hearted, sentimental and ingenuous even under the shadow of misfortune; and what is better still, while disaster did not discourage him nor make him pessimistic, good fortune's tide never modified the traits that under normal professional conditions impulsed those who came in close contact with him to affectionate regard.</p>

<p>The Mirror has received many tokens of professional appreciation of Mr. Mayo, and epitomizes them in the above statement of its own conception of the man. But one tribute, received from a clergyman, is so earnest and significant that it is here given in full: </p>

<p>LOWELL, Mass., June 9, 1896.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of The Dramatic Mirror:</i></p>

<p>SIR.&ndash;As a reader of THE MIRROR I wish to write a work in memory of Frank Mayo. I had the honor of a personal acquaintance, and when I read of his death I was filled with the deepest sorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayo won my heart many years ago, when for the first time I saw him in the role of Davy Crockett. I have always considered him one of the greatest actors of the world, and in many roles he led all others. His latest and crowning success filled the hearts of his legion of friends with joy.</p>

<p>He was a man of vast resources; he had a giant intellect; few men could equal him as a conversationalist; his character was beyond reproach.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago he wrote to me that he was suffering with acute dyspepsia, but hoped soon to be better. He promised me a visit in the Fall, D. V., when we were to talk over his play and other matters of interest. I anticipated a visit of especial pleasure, but God has ordained otherwise. Yet such men cannot die. Such men as Mr. Mayo teach us more than anything else that man can be immortal. Such genius, intellect, and pure manhood are as eternal as God Himself. The world will be poorer by his going, but richer by the influence that he has left on us. His life is worthy of emulation by all, I care not what their work in life may be. Let clergymen who could condemn, pause and think that Frank Mayo was an actor, and they, too, can take pattern from his life. The character of the man is shown in a letter, to me, after learning that I had assumed a new charge. In this letter he said: "I hope that it is a matter for congratulation&ndash;your change of base&ndash;but in your great calling, place is of a secondary consideration&ndash;for good may be done everywhere, and where the field is, there the worker belongs." May we thank god that we have had such a man in the world and in the words of Lowell say:</p>

<p>"Farewell! good man, good angel now, this hand</p>
<p>Soon, like thine own, shall lose its cunning too;</p>
<p>Soon shall this soul, like thine, bewildered stand,</p>
<p>Then leap to thread the free, unfathomed blue.</p>
<p>The laurel leaf I cast upon thy bier</p>
<p>Let worthier hands than these entwine;</p>
<p>Upon thy hearse I shed no useless tear&ndash;</p>
<p>For us weep rather thou in calm divine!"</p>

<p>May God bless the stricken family, and all who are left to mourn.      Most truly yours.</p>

<p>C. E. FISHER,</p>
<p>Pastor First Universalist Church.</p>

<p>Surely no expression from one of the dead actor's profession could be more full of feeling or appreciation than this token from one of his clerical friends and admirers.</p>
