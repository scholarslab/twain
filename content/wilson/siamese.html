          <h2>Personal Habits of the Siamese Twins</h2>
        </center><img src="twins1.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1875 ILLUSTRATION" /> I
        do not wish to write of the personal <i>habits</i> of these
        strange creatures solely, but also of certain curious
        details of various kinds concerning them, which, belonging
        only to their private life, have never crept into print.
        Knowing the Twins intimately, I feel that I am peculiarly
        well qualified for the task I have taken upon myself.

        <p>The Siamese Twins are naturally tender and affectionate
        in disposition, and have clung to each other with singular
        fidelity throughout a long and eventful life. Even as
        children they were inseparable companions; and it was
        noticed that they always seemed to prefer each other's
        society to that of any other persons. They nearly always
        played together; and, so accustomed was their mother to
        this peculiarity, that, whenever both of them chance to be
        lost, she usually only hunted for one of them--satisfied
        that when she found that one she would find his brother
        somewhere in the immediate neighborhood. And yet these
        creatures were ignorant and unlettered--barbarians
        themselves and the offspring of barbarians, who knew not
        the light of philosophy and science. What a withering
        rebuke is this to our boasted civilization, with its
        quarrelings, its wrangling, and its separations of
        brothers!</p>

        <p>As men, the Twins have not always lived in perfect
        accord; but, still, there has always been a bond between
        them which made them unwilling to go away from each other
        and dwell apart. They have even occupied the same house, as
        a general thing, and it is believed that they have never
        failed to even sleep together on any night since they were
        born. How surely do the habits of a lifetime become second
        nature to us! The Twins always go to bed at the same time;
        but Chang usually gets up about an hour before his brother.
        By an understanding between themselves, Chang does all the
        in-door work and Eng runs all the errands. This is because
        Eng likes to go out; Chang's habits are sedentary. However,
        Chang always goes along. Eng is a Baptist, but Chang is a
        Roman Catholic; still, to please his brother, Chang
        consented to be baptized at the same time that Eng was, on
        condition that it should not "count." During the War they
        were strong partisans, and both fought gallantly all
        through the great struggle--Eng on the Union side and Chang
        on the Confederate. They took each other prisoners at Seven
        Oaks, but the proofs of capture were so evenly balanced in
        favor of each that a general army court had to be assembled
        to determine which one was properly the captor and which
        the captive. The jury was unable to agree for a long time;
        but the vexed question was finally decided by agreeing to
        consider them both prisoners, and then exchanging them. At
        one time Chang was convicted of disobedience of orders, and
        sentenced to ten days in the guard house; but Eng, in spite
        of all arguments, felt obliged to share his imprisonment,
        notwithstanding he himself was entirely innocent; and so,
        to save the blameless brother from suffering, they had to
        discharge both from custody--the just reward of
        faithfulness.</p>

        <p>Upon one occasion the brothers fell out about something,
        and Chang knocked Eng down, and then tripped and fell on
        him, whereupon both clinched and began to beat and gouge
        each other without mercy. The bystanders interfered and
        tried to separate them, but they could not do it, and so
        allowed them to fight it out. In the end both were
        disabled, and were carried to the hospital on one and the
        same shutter.</p>

        <p>Their ancient habit of going always together had its
        drawbacks when they reached man's estate and entered upon
        the luxury of courting. Both fell in love with the same
        girl. Each tried to steal clandestine interviews with her,
        but at the critical moment the other would always turn up.
        By-and bye Eng saw, with distraction, that Chang had won
        the girl's affections; and, from that day forth, he had to
        bear with the agony of being a witness to all their dainty
        billing and cooing. But, with a magnanimity that did him
        infinite credit, he succumbed to his fate, and gave
        countenance and encouragement to a state of things that
        bade fair to sunder his generous heart-strings. He sat from
        seven every evening until two in the morning listening to
        the fond foolishness of the two lovers, and to the
        concussion of hundreds of squandered kisses--for the
        privilege of sharing only one of which he would have given
        his right hand. But he sat patiently, and waited, and
        gaped, and yawned, and stretched, and longed for two
        o'clock to come. And he took long walks with the lovers on
        moonlight evenings--sometimes traversing ten miles,
        notwithstanding he was usually suffering from rheumatism.
        He is an inveterate smoker; but he could not smoke on these
        occasions, because the young lady was painfully sensitive
        to the smell of tobacco. Eng cordially wanted them married,
        and done with it; but, although Chang often asked the
        momentous question, the young lady could not gather
        sufficient courage to answer it while Eng was by. However,
        on one occasion, after having walked some sixteen miles,
        and sat up till nearly daylight, Eng dropped asleep, from
        sheer exhaustion, and then the question was asked and
        answered. The lovers were married. All acquainted with the
        circumstances applauded the noble brother-in-law. His
        unwavering faithfulness was the theme of every tongue. He
        had staid by them all through their long and arduous
        courtship; and when, at last, they were married, he lifted
        his hands above their heads, and said with impressive
        unction, "Bless ye, my children, I will never desert ye!"
        and he kept his word. Magnanimity like this is all too rare
        in this cold world.</p>

        <p>By-and-bye Eng fell in love with his sister-in-law's
        sister, and married her, and since that day they have all
        lived together, night and day, in an exceeding sociability
        which is touching and beautiful to behold, and is a
        scathing rebuke to our boasted civilization.</p>

        <p><img src="twins2.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt="1875 ILLUSTRATION" /> The
        sympathy existing between these two brothers is so close
        and so refined that the feelings, the impulses, the
        emotions of the one are instantly experienced by the other.
        When one is sick, the other is sick; when one feels pain,
        the other feels it; when one is angered, the other's temper
        takes fire. We have already seen with what happy facility
        they both fell in love with the same girl. Now, Chang is
        bitterly opposed to all forms of intemperance, on
        principle; but Eng is the reverse--for, while these men's
        feelings and emotions are so closely wedded, their
        reasoning faculties are unfettered; their <i>thoughts</i>
        are free. Chang belongs to the Good Templars, and is a
        hard-working and enthusiastic supporter of all temperance
        reforms. But, to his bitter distress, every now and then
        Eng gets drunk, and, of course, that makes Chang drunk too.
        This unfortunate thing has been a great sorrow to Chang,
        for it almost destroys his usefulness in his favorite field
        of effort. As sure as he is to head a great temperance
        procession Eng ranges up alongside of him, prompt to the
        minute and drunk as a lord; but yet no more dismally and
        hopelessly drunk than his brother who has not tasted a
        drop. And so the two begin to hoot and yell, and throw mud
        and bricks at the Good Templars; and, of course, they break
        up the procession. It would be manifestly wrong to punish
        Chang for what Eng does, and, therefore, the Good Templars
        accept the untoward situation, and suffer in silence and
        sorrow. They have officially and deliberately examined into
        the matter, and find Chang blameless. They have taken the
        two brothers and filled Chang full of warm water and sugar
        and Eng full of whiskey, and in twenty-five minutes it was
        not possible to tell which was the drunkest. Both were as
        drunk as loons--and on hot whiskey punches, by the smell of
        their breath. Yet all the while Chang's moral principles
        were unsullied, his conscience clear; and so all just men
        were forced to confess that he was not morally, but only
        physically drunk. By every right and by every moral
        evidence the man was strictly sober; and, therefore, it
        caused his friends all the more anguish to see him shake
        hands with the pump and try to wind his watch with his
        night-key.</p>

        <p>There is a moral in these solemn warnings--or, at least,
        a warning in these solemn morals; one or the other. No
        matter, it is somehow. Let us heed it; let us profit by
        it.</p>

        <p>I could say more of an instructive nature about these
        interesting beings, but let what I have written
        suffice.</p>

        <p>Having forgotten to mention it sooner, I will remark, in
        conclusion, that the ages of the Siamese Twins are
        respectively fifty-one and fifty-three years.</p>
