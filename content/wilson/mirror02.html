<p>HARTFORD.&ndash;PROCTOR'S OPERA HOUSE (F. W. Lloyd Manager):</p> 

<p>The first performance of Mark Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead Wilson," dramatized by Frank Mayo, occurred 8, 9 and as chronicled in the special dispatch on the opening night, made a great sucess. On the second presentation much of the dialogue had been cut out, making the play run smoother.</p>
