<p>Amphion.&ndash;Pudd'nhead Wilson.</p>

<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson was given a good presentation here last night. The play was given in a way to insure enjoyment to the large audience. Frank Mayo as David Wilson, Mark Twain's hero, lacked nothing in simplicity of manner, humor and conscientious acting in portraying the character, and was warmly applauded. He responded to several curtain calls. Eleanor Moretti, gave a strong interpretation of Roxy and was well liked. Rowy was cleverly played by Frances Grahame. Frank E. Aiken, Newton Chisnell, Frank Compeau, Emmett C. King, Will S. Gill, and Lucile La Verne filled parts acceptably. Next week, Trilby.</p>
