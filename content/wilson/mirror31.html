<p>PUDD'NHEAD WILSON WILL GO OUT AGAIN</p>

<p>Pudd'nhead Wilson will go out again nest season under the management of C. E. Evans. The play is still regarded as very valuable property, and has not yet been seen in a large territory where it is sure to prove popular. Manager Evans is endeavoring to secure some good character actor for the title role, and though Frank Mayo's magnetic personality is sure to be sorely missed, it is probable that some one can be secured to give more than a mere perfunctory performance of the part. Mr. Evans, it is said, wanted W. H. Thompson for Pudd'nhead, but this actor is already under contract to the Miner-Brooks syndicate for next season. Mr. Evans is said to be negotiating with Odell Williams to play the part.</p>
