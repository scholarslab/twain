          <h2><i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i></h2>
        </center>The setting of this novel is again the world that
        Sam Clemens grew up in, although now MT calls the village
        Dawson's Landing, and has moved it several hundred miles
        down the Mississippi River. The book was originally
        published in America, on 28 November 1894, as <i>The
        Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson and the Comedy of Those
        Extraordinary Twins</i>. It began as a farce about Siamese
        twins -- two different temperaments inseparably linked in
        one body -- and wound up becoming an irony about two babies
        -- one slave, one free -- switched in their cradles. It was
        never very popular with MT's contemporaries, but as his
        most direct, sustained treatment of slavery it has
        attracted considerable attention in our time; there is as
        yet, however, no agreement about what it's saying. In Roxy
        the novel offers MT's most complex woman character. Despite
        the title, most commentary on the book assumes that her
        son, Tom/Valet de Chambers, is the central character. My
        own reading of it begins with the title. It is curious that
        MT should call it a <i>tragedy</i> when its ending is
        classically comic: true identities and an apparent social
        order are restored. And curiouser that he calls it
        <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson's</i> tragedy, when Wilson enacts the
        rise from obscurity to popularity and prestige that is
        usually thought of as the archetypal American success
        story.<br />
