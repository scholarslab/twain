        <p>Mark Twain's serial magazine story of Missouri life in a
        river town, in slavery days "befo'de wah," is now issued in
        handsome book form by the American Publishing Company of
        this city, who have once more the right to bring out Mr.
        Clemens's works. Reading any story in serial form, in a
        monthly magazine, is a very unsatisfactory way of getting
        hold of it; and this appearance of Mr. Clemens's latest
        work in a new volume ought to secure it for many new
        readers. The marginal vignette pictures, on every page, add
        nothing to the value or interest of the book, and might as
        well have been omitted; but the story itself is one of the
        queerest. One can well believe the author's statement, in
        <i>Those Extraordinary Twins</i>, the roaring comedy which
        follows what he considers the tragedy of the longer story,
        that he lost control, both of the characters and the
        "plot," in <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, and made of it a mixed
        mess very different from his intention at the start. It
        would be "easy work" to criticise some of the features of
        the main story, but who ever feels like criticising Mark
        Twain?</p>

        <p>Pudd'nhead Wilson is not the most prominent character in
        the book; that place is usurped by the worthless Tom
        Driscoll, whose one-thirty-second part of "nigger" blood
        proves, in spite of his octoroon mother's strong character,
        his bane and his downfall. The practice of Pudd'nhead, in
        getting everybody, from babies to old people, to imprint
        the story told in an impression made by the differing lines
        produced by the ball of the finger on slightly greased
        glass, and religiously saving every strip of glass thus
        marked, proves to be the key to the turning point of the
        story; but it is an improbable practice, for anybody.
        However, one can't criticise "Mark"--and moreover his own
        experience of the possibilities of palmistry lends a
        peculiar interest to this peculiar application of the
        alleged principle to the purposes of this queer story. As
        to Angelo and Luigi, the Italian twins and noblemen--well,
        their appearance as twins of the Siamese sort, in the
        comedy, is quite as inherently probable as it is in the
        other way as such a place as Dawson's Landing. But
        probability, inherent or extraneous, is as soon to be
        looked in Mark Twain's stories as in the <i>Arabian
        Nights</i>.</p>

        <p>The comedy, an appendix to the story, is here published
        for the first time; and the author introduces it in a frank
        and funny revelation of the way in which <i>Pudd'nhead</i>
        came to be written--or to write itself. He even explains
        how he came to introduce quotations from Pudd'nhead's
        "Calendar." As some of them are queer and funny, we quote a
        sample or two, beginning with the funniest:</p>

        <p>Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance
        of a good example.</p>

        <p>It is not the best that we should all think alike; it is
        the difference of opinion that makes horse races.</p>

        <p>Adam was but human--this explains it all. He did not
        want the apple for the apple's sake; he wanted it only
        because it was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding
        the serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent.</p>

        <p>Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even
        the undertaker will be sorry.</p>

        <p>Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a
        funeral? It is because we are not the person involved.</p>

        <p>When I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people
        who I know to have gone to a better world I am moved to
        lead a different life.</p>

        <p>Nothing needs so reforming as other people's habits.</p>

        <p>If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous,
        he will not bite you. This is the principal difference
        between a dog and a man.</p>

        <p>Thanksgiving Day. Let all give humble, hearty, and
        sincere thanks now, but the turkeys. In the island of Fiji
        they do not use turkeys; they use plumbers. It does not
        become you and me to sneer at Fiji.</p>

        <p>Even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial
        evidence is likely to be at fault after all and therefore
        ought to be received with great caution. Take the case of
        any pencil sharpened by any woman. If you have witnesses
        you will find she did it with a knife; but if you take
        simply the aspect of the pencil, you will say she did it
        with her teeth.</p>

        <p>April 1. This is the day upon which we are all reminded
        of what we are on the other three hundred and
        sixty-four.</p>

        <p>There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it
        can be destroyed by ridicule, howsoever poor and witless.
        Observe the ass, for instance: his character is about
        perfect, he is the choicest spirit among all the humble
        animals, yet see what ridicule has brought him to. Instead
        of feeling complimented when we are called an ass, we are
        left in doubt.</p>

        <p>Consider well the proportion of things. It is better to
        be a young June-bug than an old bird of paradise.</p>

        <p>Adam and Eve had many advantages, but the principal one
        was, that they escaped teething.</p>
