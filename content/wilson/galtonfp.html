        displayed his own fingerprints as part of his title page.
        His Introduction begins by calling his readers' attention
        to "the so-called papillary ridges." Wilson's introduction
        of fingerprints at the trial is MT's version of the
        following paragraph, the second in Galton's book:</i>]

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let no one despise the ridges
        on account of their smallness, for they are in some
        respects the most important of all anthropological data. We
        shall see that they form patterns, considerable in size and
        of a curious variety of shape, whose boundaries can be
        firmly outlined, and which are little worlds in themselves.
        They have the unique merit of retaining their peculiarities
        unchanged throughout life, and afford in consequence an
        incomparably surer criterion of identity than any other
        bodily feature. They may be made to throw welcome light on
        some of the most interesting biological questions of the
        day, such as heredity, symmetry, correlation, and the
        nature of genera and species. A representation of their
        lineations is easily secured in a self-recorded form, by
        inking the fingers in the way that will be explained, and
        pressing them on paper. There is no prejudice to be
        overcome in procuring these most trustworthy sign-manuals,
        no vanity to be pacified, no untruths to be guarded
        against. (Pp. 1-2)</p>

        [<i>It's not clear what Galton means by "prejudice" in the
        above. In fact throughout his book a strong connection is
        maintained between fingerprints and race. The first use of
        fingerprints for identification was by the British raj in
        India. In the paragraph below Galton connects his subject
        explicitly up with the subjects of imperialism. He is
        saying that fingerprints are especially useful in the
        colonies, where "they" all look alike and are all
        liars!</i>]

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the tenth chapter we come to
        a practical result of the inquiry, namely, its possible use
        as a means of differentiating a man from his fellows. In
        civil as well as in criminal cases, the need of some such
        system is shown to be greatly felt in many of our
        dependencies; where the features of the natives are
        distinguished with difficulty; where there is but little
        variety of surnames; where there are strong motives for
        prevarication, especially connected with land-tenure and
        pensions, and a proverbial prevalence of unveracity. (P.
        14)</p>

        <img src="galtonb.jpg" align="left" hspace=
        "7" alt= "ILLUSTRATION: GALTON'S FINGER PRINTS" />[<i>Galton's book includes a number of tables and
        illustrations, including this proof of the way a child's
        fingerprints remain the same over time (left). Later in the
        Introduction Galton indicates how his original interest in
        fingerprints was linked to an idea that they might serve to
        establish definitive racial differences.</i>]

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the twelth chapter we come
        to a branch of the subject of which I had great
        expectations, that have been falsified, namely, their use
        in indicating Race and Temperament. I thought that any
        hereditary peculiarities would almost of necessity vary in
        different races, and that so fundamental and enduring a
        feature as the finger markings must in some way be
        correlated with temperament.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The races I have chiefly
        examined are English, most of whom are of the upper and
        middle classes; the others chiefly from London board
        schools; Welsh, from the purest Welsh-speaking districts of
        South Wales; Jews from the large London schools, and
        Negroes from the territories of the Royal Niger Company. I
        have also a collection of Basque prints taken at Cambo,
        some twenty miles inland from Biarritz, which, although
        small, is large enough to warrant a provisional conclusion.
        As a first and only an approximately correct description,
        the English, Welsh, Jews, Negroes, and Basques, may all be
        spoken of as identitical in the character of their finger
        prints; the same familiar patterns appearing in all of them
        which much the same degrees of frequency, the differences
        between groups of different races being not larger than
        those that occasionally occur between groups of the same
        race. The Jews have, however, a decidedly larger proportion
        of Whorled patterns than other races, and I should have
        been tempted to make an assertion about a peculiarity in
        the Negroes, had not one of their groups differed greatly
        from the rest. The task of examination has been laborious
        thus far, but it would be much more so to arrive with
        correctness at a second and closer approximation to the
        truth. It is doubtful at present whether it is worthwhile
        to pursue the subject, except in the case of the Hill
        tribes of India and a few other peculiarly diverse races,
        for the chance of discovering some characteristic and
        perhaps a more monkey-like pattern. (Pp. 17-18)</p>
        <hr width="55%" />
        [<i>In Chapter XII, "Races and Classes," Galton develops in
        a bit more detail his expectations about the relationship
        between those categories and the innate identity encoded in
        fingerprints. Like most 19th century discussions on the
        subject, Galton's confuses nationality with race, and
        assumes his own racist predispositions are "reasonable." To
        his credit, though, he accepts the fact that there is no
        empirical basis for racial discrimination based on
        fingerprints.</i>]

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It requires considerable
        patience and caution to arrive at trustworthy conclusions,
        but it may emphatically be said that there is no
        <i>peculiar</i> pattern which characterises persons of any
        of the above races [i.e. English, pure Welsh, Hebrew, Negro
        and Basque]. There is no particular pattern that is special
        to any one of them, which when met with enables us to
        assert, or even to suspect, the nationality of the person
        on whom it appeared. The only differences so far observed
        are statistical, and cannot be determined except through
        patience and caution, and by discussing large groups.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was misled at first by some
        accidental observations, and as it seemed reasonable to
        expect to find racial differences in finger marks, the
        inquiries were continued in varied ways until hard fact had
        made hope no longer justifiable. (Pg. 192-93)</p>
        <hr width="55%" />
        [<i>As if determined to discriminate between races even in
        the face of the evidence, Galton did "find" the following
        "evidence." He does not give any illustration to support
        this finding, however.</i>]

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of instances is of
        course too small for statistical deductions, but they
        served to make it clear that no very marked characteristic
        distinguished the races. The impressions from Negroes
        betray the general clumsiness of their fingers, but their
        patterns are not, so far as I can find, different from
        those of others, they are not simpler as judged either by
        their contours or by the number of origins, embranchments,
        islands, and enclosures contained in them. Still, whether
        it be from pure fancy on my part, or from the way in which
        they were printed, or from some real peculiarity, the
        general aspect of the Negro print strikes me as
        characteristic. The width of the ridges seems more uniform,
        their intervals more regular, and their courses more
        parallel than with us. In short, they give an idea of
        greater simplicity, due to causes that I have not yet
        succeeded in submitting to the test of measurement. (Pg.
        195-96)</p>

        <p>[<i>Galton goes on briefly to admit that, although he
        compared "art-students" and "science-students" with "the
        worst idiots in the London district," he has found "no
        notable difference" in fingerprints on any "class"
        basis.</i>]</p>
