        <p>Mark Twain's <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson and Those
        Extraordinary Twins</i> which he is pleased to term a
        tragedy and a comedy respectively are published together
        with lavish marginal illustrations. These pictures are the
        most praiseworthy feature of the volume, although they vary
        considerably. The author was not at his best when he wrote
        these stories. They are funny, and now and then very funny.
        But a coarse streak comes to the surface every little while
        and is disagreeable. The book is handsomely gotten up by
        the publishers and does them credit, but we cannot commend
        the stories which compose it to our readers very
        heartily.</p>
