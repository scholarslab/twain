          <h2>Original Broadway Production</h2>
        </center>In its regular Sunday theater column, <i>The New
        York Times</i> announced the play the day before it opened
        at the Herald Square Theatre. The brief discussion of
        Mayo's interpolation of a love story apparently assumes
        that most readers would already know "the story of the
        book":<br />

        The critic who reviewed the play for the Tuesday, April
        16th, <i>Times</i> was friendly but not very impressed.
        <a name="a" id="a">This review</a> does provide the best
        summary of the drama I've found:<br />

        The reviewer from <i>The New York Tribune</i> emphasized
        Mayo's performance in the title role. <a name="b" id=

        showed in the play's reception in New York:<br />

        At the end of the play's first week in New York, the Sunday
        <i>Times</i> printed a second review of it -- probably the
        work of a different critic. Of the reviews I've seen,
        <a name="c" id="c">this is</a> the one that puts the most
        emphasis on race; it reads Chambers and Tom as determined
        by their respective Caucasian and Ethopian "natures":<br />

        </center><br />
        The Sunday <i>New York Herald</i> reviewed the play under
        an illustration of its last act. It called the play an
        "unquestioned success." It ends by referring to "the evils
        of slavery," but focuses chiefly on <a name="d" id=
        "d">Mayo's work</a> as both dramatist and actor:<br />

        </center><br />
In its brief note on the play, the humor magazine <i>Life</i> kept its focus on the "lovable" character of "Pudd'nhead" himself, and Frank Mayo's work in bringing him to life:<br />

The play ended its first New York run in the middle of June; in July Beaumont Fletcher, the drama critic for <i>Godey's Magazine</i> (which was also nearing the end of its run as one of 19th century America's most popular periodicals), wrote a long appreciative essay on Mayo's dramatization.  He is more interested in what the play reveals about the superiority of drama to fiction, but includes both a surprisingly frank acknowledgment of how the customs of slavery exposed the hypocrisy of the idea that America had always been "the land of the free" and an unexamined assertion that Tom's viciousness was proof of the "negro-taint" carried by his blood.  The essay is illustrated with seven photos of the original cast in their characters and costumes:<br />
