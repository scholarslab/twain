          New York run he attended a performance. When the audience

          Mayo's play and his novel, and a lot about his
          difficulties with twins.</i>]

        </center>Mark Twain fulfilled the promise which he made on
        the occasion of his former visit to the Herald Square
        Theatre, and was there again last night with the avowed
        purpose of discovering how Mr. Mayo had managed the twins.

        <p>He was obviously gratified by his researches, for his
        applause of the performance was frequent and hearty.
        Indeed, the presentation of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" was never
        better, the presence of Mr. Clemens seeming to give
        especial enthusiasm to artists and audience alike.</p>

        <p>At the end of the third act there were vehement clamors
        for Mark Twain, and he responded, speaking from his box, as
        follows:--</p>

        <center>
          <b><font size="-1">MR. CLEMENS' OBSERVATIONS.</font></b>
        </center>"I am sure I could say many complimentary things
        about this play which Mr. Mayo has written and about his
        portrayal of the chief character in it and keep well within
        the bounds both of fact and of good taste; but I will limit
        myself to two or three. I do not know how to utter any
        higher praise than this--that when Mayo's Pudd'nhead walks
        this stage here, clothed in the charm of his gentle
        charities of speech and acts and the sweet simplicities and
        sincerities of his gracious nature, the thought in my mind
        is:--Why, bless your heart, you couldn't be any dearer or
        lovelier or sweeter than you are without turning into that
        man whom all men love and even Satan is fond of--Joe
        Jefferson.

        <p>"I am gratified to see that Mr. Mayo has been able to
        manage those difficult twins. I tried, but in my hands they
        failed. When I was here year before last there was an
        Italan freak on exhibition in Philadelphia who was an
        exaggeration of the Siamese twins. This freak had one body,
        one pair of legs, two heads and four arms. I thought he
        would be useful in a book, so I put him in. And then the
        trouble began. I called those consolidated twins Angelo and
        Luigi, and I tried to make them nice and agreeable, but it
        was not possible. They would not do anything my way, but
        only their own. They were wholly unmanageable, and not a
        day went by that they didn't develop some new kind of
        devilishness, particularly Luigi. Angelo was of a religious
        turn of mind, and was monotonously honest and honorable and
        upright, and tediously proper; whereas Luigi had no
        principles, no morals, no religion--a perfect blatherskite,
        and an inextricable tangle theologically--infidel, atheist
        and agnostic, all mixed together. He was of a malicious
        disposition, and liked to eat things which disagreed with
        his brother.</p>

        <center>
          <b><font size="-1">ONE'S MEAT THE OTHER'S
          POISON.</font></b>
        </center>"They were so strangely organized that what one of
        them ate or drank had no effect upon himself, but only
        nourished or damaged the other one. Luigi was hearty and
        robust because Angelo ate the best and most wholesome food
        he could find for him, but Angelo himself was delicate and
        sickly, because every day Luigi filled him up with mince
        pies and salt junk, just because he knew he could not
        digest them. Luigi was very dissipated, but it didn't show
        on him, but only on his brother. His brother was a strict
        and conscientious teetotaler, but he was drunk most of the
        time on account of Luigi's habits. Angelo was president of
        the Prohibition Society, but they had to turn him out
        because every time he appeared at the head of the
        procession on parade he was a scandalous spectacle to look
        at.

        <p>"On the other hand Angelo was a trouble to Luigi the
        infidel, because he was always changing his religion,
        trying to find the best one, and he always preferred sects
        that believed in baptism by immersion, and this was a
        constant peril and discomfort to Luigi, who couldn't stand
        water, outside or in, and so every time Angelo got baptized
        Luigi got drowned, and had to be pumped out and
        resuscitated. Luigi was irascible, yet was never willing to
        stand by the consequences of his acts. He was always
        kicking somebody, and laying it on Angelo. And when the
        kicked person kicked back Luigi would say:--"What are you
        kicking me for? I haven't done anything to you." Then the
        man would be sorry and say:--"Well, I didn't mean any harm,
        I thought it was you, but you see you people have only one
        body between you, and I can't tell which of you I'm
        kicking. I don't know how to discriminate. I do not wish to
        be unfair, and so there is no way for me to do but to kick
        one of you and apologize to the other." They were a
        troublesome pair in every way. If they did any work for you
        they charged for two, but at the boardinghouse they ate and
        slept for two and only paid for one.</p>

        <center>
          <b><font size="-1">HARD ON THE THEATRES.</font></b>
        </center>"In the trains they wouldn't pay for two because
        they only occupied one seat. The same at the theatre. Luigi
        bought one ticket and deadheaded Angelo in. They couldn't
        put Angelo out because they couldn't put the deadhead out
        without putting out the twin that had paid, and scooping in
        a suit for damages.

        <p>"Luigi grew steadily more and more wicked, and I saw by
        and by that the way he was going on he was bound to land in
        the eternal tropics, and at the bottom I was glad of it;
        but I knew he would necessarily take his righteous brother
        down there with him, and that would not be fair. I did not
        object to it, but I didn't want to be responsible for it. I
        was in such a hobble that there was only one way out. To
        save the righteous brother I had to pull the consolidated
        twins apart and make two separate and distinct twins of
        them. Well, as soon as I did that, they lost all their
        energy and took no further interest in life. They were
        wholly futile and useless in the book; they became mere
        shadows and so they remain. Mr. Mayo manages them, but if
        he had taken a chance at them before I pulled them apart
        and tamed them he would have found out early that if he put
        them in his play they would take full possession and there
        wouldn't be any room for Pudd'nhead Wilson or anybody
        else.</p>

        <center>
          <b><font size="-1">TRUTH BEING VALUABLE, HE ECONOMIZES
          IT.</font></b>
        </center>"I have taken four days to prepare these
        statistics, and as far as they go you can depend upon their
        being strictly true. I have not told all the truth about
        the twins, but just barely enough of it for business
        purposes, for my motto is--and Pudd'nhead Wilson can adopt
        it if he wants to--my motto is, 'Truth is the most valuable
        thing we have; let us economize it.'"

        <p>At the close of Mr. Clemens's speech Mr. Mayo was called
        for, and responded briefly, paying a tribute of praise to
        the constant generosity of the management.</p>
