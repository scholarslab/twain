        <p>If reports from New York are to be credited Frank Mayo
        has, in the play he has made of Mark Twain's story of life
        in the southwest before the war, breathed the breath of
        life into the creation of Mark Twain's fertile brain. The
        result is a half-score of the quaintest, queerest, most
        lovable men and women ever introduced on the stage.</p>

        <p>At the head of all is Mr. Mayo's own creation of the
        eccentric, wise, witty old village lawyer, who patiently
        waits nearly a quarter of a century for his first client.
        In the meantime he interests himself in taking prints of
        the balls of the thumbs of his neighbors on bits of glass,
        filing them away that he might study the curious lines,
        curves, whorls, loops and flourishes that adorn the thumb
        of every human being. The wonder of it all is that there
        are no two among the teeming millions of this earth that
        are alike. This fad of his with his many other
        eccentricities led to David Wilson being called by his
        neighbors a "pudd'nhead."</p>

        <p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" will be presented for the first time
        in this city at the Tremont theater tomorrow evening. The
        regular matinees will be given on Wednesday and Saturday,
        and a special holiday matinee will be given Thursday. Mr.
        Mayo is surrounded by a company of sterling artists
        numbering some Boston favorites, notably Miss Eleanor
        Moretti, and the scenic embellishment of the play is said
        to be uniquely picturesque and effective.</p>
