        <p>By clicking on the picture at the right you can see a
        poster advertising the appearance of Chang and Eng, the
        Barnumesque attraction that toured America during Sam
        Clemens childhood, and then stuck in MT's imagination for
        the rest of his life. The title page below is from a
        sixteen page pamphlet that could be purchased in the
        exhibition hall where the "Siamese Twins" were on display
        in New York City in 1834. The pamphlet describes the twins
        in both physical and psychological detail. Although MT
        typically (and comically) treats his Siamese twins as
        warring personalities, the author of the pamphlet stresses
        their "most perfect equanimity." According to him, they
        felt such complete sympathy and accord with one another
        that they never spoke to each other, much less argued:
        "many who have visited them have left under the impression
        that they were actuated by only one mind."</p><br clear=
