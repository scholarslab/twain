<p>Frank Mayo, the distinguished American actor, has appeared in his last play. Death gently lowered the curtain over his busy life on the Pullman while he and his co. were journeying to Omaha to give what was intended to be the closing engagement of the season. All arrangements had been made by the local Lodge of Elks to tender Mr. Mayo and his co., together with the Roland Reed and Primrose and West cos. a special entertainment. But the flowers that were to add to the festivities of the reception served to swell the mass of like tributes of esteem that surrounded the bier. The remains were escorted to the train by the Elks in a body, and many hearts throbbed with sorrow as they paid their last testimonial of regard and esteem to this fine type of manhood.</p>
