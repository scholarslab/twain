          <p>The literary critic is often puzzled how to classify
          the intellectual phenomena that come within his ken. His
          business is of course primarily with <i>literature</i>. A
          work may be infinitely amusing, it may abound even with
          flashes and touches of genius, and yet the form in which
          it comes into the world may be so crude, so coarse, so
          erring from the ways of true classicism, so offensive to
          immemorial canons of taste, that the critic, in spite of
          his enjoyment and wonder, puts it reluctantly down in the
          category of unclassifiable literary things only to take
          it up and enjoy it again!</p>

          <p>Of such is <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, and, for that
          matter, Mark Twain in general. The author is a signal
          example of sheer genius, without training or culture in
          the university sense, setting forth to conquer the world
          with laughter whether it will or no, and to get himself
          thereby acknowledged to be the typical writer of the
          West. He is the most successful of a class of American
          humorists whose impulse to write off their rush of animal
          spirits is irresistible, and who snatch at the first pen
          within reach as the conductor of their animal
          electricity. If we look at other national humorists, like
          Aristophanes, Cervantes, Moliere or Swift, we find their
          humor expressed in an exquisite literary form, in which a
          certain polish tempers the extravagance, and annoying
          metrical (or it may be imaginative) difficulties have
          been overcome. What wonderful bird-rhythms and wasp
          melodies and cloud-architecture, so to speak, emerge from
          the marvellous choral interludes of the Greek comedian;
          what suave literary graces enclose the gaunt outlines of
          Don Quixote; in what honeyed verse are Alceste and
          Tartuffe entangled, and what new, nervous, powerful prose
          describes the adventures of Gulliver! When we turn our
          eyes westward we encounter Judge Haliburton, Hosea
          Biglow, Uncle Remus, Mark Twain -- an absolutely new
          <i>genre</i> distinct from what we had previously studied
          in the line of originalities. The one accomplished artist
          among these is Lowell, whose university traditions were
          very strong and controlled his bubbling humor. The others
          are pure "naturalists" -- men of instinctive genius, who
          have relied on their own conscious strength to produce
          delight in the reader, irrespective of classicity of
          form, literary grace or any other of the beloved
          conventions on which literature as literature has
          hitherto depended. This is true in a less degree of Uncle
          Remus than of Judge Haliburton and Mark Twain.</p>

          <p><i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> is no exception to the rule.
          It is a Missouri tale of changelings "befo' the wah,"
          admirable in atmosphere, local color and dialect, a drama
          in its way, full of powerful situations, thrilling even;
          but it cannot be called in any sense literature. In it
          Mark Twain's brightness and grotesqueness and funniness
          revel and sparkle, and in the absurd extravaganza, "Those
          Extraordinary Twins," all these comicalities reach the
          buffoon point; one is amused and laughs unrestrainedly
          but then the irksome question comes up: What <i>is</i>
          this? is it literature? is Mr. Clemens a "writer" at all?
          must he not after all be described as an admirable
          after-dinner storyteller -- humorous, imaginative,
          dramatic, like Dickens -- who in an evil moment, urged by
          admiring friends, has put pen to paper and written down
          his stories? Adapted to the stage and played by Frank
          Mayo, the thing has met with immediate success.</p>
