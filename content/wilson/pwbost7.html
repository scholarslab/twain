        <p>Mr. A.M. Sheehan, treasurer of the Tremont theater, wore
        an expression of supreme satisfaction last evening, for he
        was taking his annual benefit and the house was crowded by
        an exceptionally cultured and brilliant audience.</p>

        <p>And everybody appeared delighted with "Puddn'head
        Wilson," the popular dramatization of Mark Twain's idyl of
        southern life in the lazy, peaceful ante-bellum days.</p>

        <p>The memory of the former engagement, filled at the same
        theater, is still fresh in the public mind, and yet a year
        and a half has elapsed since that event, and the lamented
        Frank Mayo, who made one of the greatest successes of his
        life in the title role, has been dead nearly a year.</p>

        <p>It was abundantly demonstrated last night that the play
        has lost nothing of its power to charm, for, quietly as the
        story revealed itself, the audience watched its progress
        with intense and never-flagging interest, and showed a keen
        appreciation of the quiet yet unctuous humor which pervades
        most of the characters.</p>

        <p>Most conspicuous among the new members of the cast are
        Theodore Hamilton in the role of Pudd'nhead and Miss Ada
        Dwyer as Roxy, the slave girl.</p>

        <p>The piece does not suffer in the least by the changes.
        Mr. Hamilton, with his manly, impressive presence, his
        genial and remarkably mobile face wins and holds every
        heart whenever he is on the stage, and Miss Dwyer is fully
        up to the demands of her strongly melodramatic role, her
        dialect being particularly realistic.</p>

        <p>It is thoroughly refreshing to witness a good play with
        two such sterling old-time actors in the cast as Messrs
        Hamilton and Aiken, both of whom are products of the old,
        efficient school, the stock company of from 30 to 40 years
        ago.</p>

        <p>Edwin F. Mayo is admirable as the sheriff, Arnold Daly
        is strong and forceful as Chambers, the hero lover, Frank
        Campau is thoroughly efficient in the part of the villain,
        and those inimitable characters Judge Robinson, Swan and
        Campbell kept the audience in good spirits whenever they
        were visible.</p>

        <p>Lucille La Verne as the old-fashioned widow, and Miss
        Mayo as the sweet southern heroine, Rowy, were both
        charming and amusing in the quaint, antique hoopskirts and
        flounces. Indeed, no small part of the delight of the play
        is due to the picturesque costumes of 50 years ago.</p>
