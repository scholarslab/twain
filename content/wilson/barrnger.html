        [<i>Dr. Barringer, Chairman of the Faculty at the
        University of Virginia, originally presented this essay at
        the 20 February 1900 meeting of the Tri-State Medical
        Association in Charleston, S.C. According to the Preface,
        he was asked to speak on "the influence of heredity upon
        the negro" at the conference. The Association then voted
        unamimously print the lecture and send copies "to all the
        medical societies in the South." Barringer's essay
        addresses itself to what he repeatedly calls "the negro
        problem" facing the South. It deals mainly with history and
        anecdote, but creates a scientific context for its ideas by
        beginning with the "biological axiom" that "the ontogeny is
        the repetition of the phylogeny," or, as he rephrases it
        for his lay reader, "the life history of any individual . .
        . will tend to conform to the lines of ancestral
        traits."</i>]

        <p>Let us apply this biological axiom to the human race,
        taking as our example of that race, the Southern negro. In
        advance, I will here state what I hope to show. I will
        endeavor to show that the American negro is the resultant
        of a combination of forces, each one of which can be
        isolated and analysed. I will show from the study of his
        racial history (phylogeny) that his late tendency to return
        to barbarism is as natural as the return of the sow that is
        washed to her wallowing in the mire. I will show that the
        ages of degradation under which he was formed and the fifty
        centuries of historically recorded savagery with which he
        came to us can not be permanently influenced by one or two
        centuries of enforced correction if the correcting force be
        withdrawn. . . .</p>

        <p>Fortunately for us, experience (history) has shown that
        these savage traits can be held down, and we have seen that
        if held down long enough, they will be bred out. In this
        one fact lies the hope of the South.</p>

        <p>[<i>His larger argument addresses itself to the rise of
        criminality among younger blacks, and advocates a legal
        return to the system of white overseeing and discipline
        that can provide the same check on "savage" tendencies as
        slavery formerly provided. To give this argument the
        appearance of scientific objectivity, Barringer begins with
        the ancestry of the Southern "negro" -- i.e. the tribes of
        the west coast of Africa. According to him, the aboriginal
        condition of the African displays the hereditary cause of
        crime in America. It's interesting to compare MT's
        character of Tom to the type Barringer describes. It's also
        probably unnecessary to state that Barringer had never been
        to Africa, and that the "Africa" he describes exists only
        in the racist mind.</i>]</p>

        <p>A feature of west coast life, that to my mind was its
        most important feature, was the absence of all restraint
        either parental, social, or governmental. The child, the
        boy, and the man followed the basest of passions, with the
        results dishonesty and robbery, cruelty and murder, lust
        and rape. Among all men we have many that are dishonest,
        yet there are few robberies; lust is, among the depraved,
        as natural as thirst, yet there is but little rapine, and
        there is, moreover, everywhere inherent cruelty, and yet
        there is little murder. With the savage, however, there is
        no self-control, and dishonesty gives theft, anger gives
        murder, and desire rape. This state of being is
        pathognomonic of savagery; and the African fills the
        bill.</p>

        <p>[<i>Of course, readers of</i> Pudd'nhead Wilson <i>can
        argue that Tom's immorality results from his training, not
        his inherent nature, and thus that he is corrupted by
        slavery. To Barringer, however, slavery was ultimately much
        better for the "negro" than freedom.</i>]</p>

        <p>And now let us turn to the influence of this "peculiar
        institution" upon the negro. Although he came to us a
        savage, with fifty generations of unalloyed savagery behind
        him, two hundred and fifty years of close association, as
        slave and master, produced changes in the race, the like of
        which has never been seen before or since.</p>

        <p>Whatever the evils of slavery may have been, and I have
        no desire to minimize them, the general result was at the
        close of the war some 4,000,000 negroes, who were in their
        average morality and character so far ahead of any other
        4,000,000 or even 1,000,000 of that race to be found
        elsewhere on the face of the earth that they were not in
        the same class. . . . No, my friends, we can boldly declare
        the old Southern house servant, male or female, as brought
        up in the better class of families, was the flood tide
        product in negro character. It seems strange that a woman
        of Mrs. Stowe's intelligence, should not have seen the
        paradoxical side of a work written in criticism of a
        civilization which produced an "Uncle Tom" and a "Topsy"
        from savage cannibals in less than five generations.</p>

        <p>[<i>Even "field hands" (according to this very
        prejudiced but ostensibly empirical account) were
        "civilized" by slavery. Since emancipation, however, the
        "negro" was been reverting to the type Barringer described
        earlier.</i>]</p>

        <p>Thirty-five years have passed since the negro changed
        from the condition of a slave to that of a freedman. In
        every part of the South, it is the opinion of every man of
        unbiased mind, that the second generation is infinitely
        worse than the first. So patent is this that I would be
        tempted to doubt the sanity of any man having fair
        opportunities to judge, who declared the reverse to be
        true. The question for us to-day, then, and the question of
        questions for the South, is, "What is the cause of the
        change and what can be done to remedy the evil?" The first
        thing is to seek out the truth, however unpalatable it may
        be, and in my opinion the truth is very simple. The young
        negro of the South, except where descended from parents of
        exceptional character and worth, is reverting through
        hereditary forces to savagery. Fifty centuries of savagery
        in the blood cannot be held down by two centuries of forced
        good behavior if the controlling influences which held down
        his savagery are withdrawn as they have been in this case.
        The language and forms of civilization may be maintained,
        but the savage nature remains. It is the nature that makes
        the criminal and imperils a civilization, not the language,
        the skin or the clothes.</p>

        <p>[<i>If MT's reader is pre-disposed to this line of
        thought, it might seem that Tom's character and actions
        prove Barringer's point. Certainly when Roxy says that it
        is "de nigger" in Tom that explains his baseness, she
        echoes this line of thought. MT's novel gives a "negro and
        slave" (as Pudd'nhead Wilson calls Tom) "the language, the
        skin and the clothes" of the white South, but depicts him
        as a gambler, thief and murderer, and returns him to
        slavery at the end. Most modern readers see that ending as
        bitterly ironic. To Barringer, on the other hand, it would
        have been redemptive. For a good discussion of racial
        thought and theories in the 1890s, see George M.
