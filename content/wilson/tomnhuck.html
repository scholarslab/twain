        Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn aren't related, and there are
        enormous differences between them. Huck, for example,
        thinks of Tom (with his basically bourgeois background) as
        a "respectable" boy while he himself (the son of the town
        drunk) is "low-down." Perhaps the most glaring difference
        is that Huck simply hates the public attention that is
        described as "food and drink" to Tom. But there are many
        signs of how these two figures were somehow twinned in MT's
        imagination.

        <p>In <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, for example,
        Huck comes close to stealing the novel's attention away
        from Tom. Before that novel was even published, MT had
        begun <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> -- but by the
        end of that book Tom's character is moved back to the
        center of the stage. In the last section, in fact, Huck
        <i>is</i> Tom, at least to Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas.</p>

        <p>Another indication of this linkage is MT's desire to
        publish <i>Huck Finn</i> in a format designed to mirror the
        look of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. And of course Huck narrates the
        books about Tom that MT published in the 1890s -- <i>Tom
        Sawyer Abroad</i> and <i>Tom Sawyer, Detective</i>. The two
        remain linked in the public's mind as well. While it's easy
        to note this interdependency, however, it's harder to see
        what it meant to MT, or what it says about him.</p>
