        <td>          <p>The best thing in <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, by Mark
          Twain (Chatto &amp; Windus), is the picture of the negro
          slave Roxana, the cause of all the trouble which gives
          scope to Mr. Wilson's ingenious discovery about
          finger-marks. Her gusts of passion or of despair, her
          vanity, her motherly love, and the glimpses of nobler
          feelings that are occasionally seen in her elementary
          code of morals, make her very human, and create a
          sympathy for her in spite of her unscrupulous actions.
          But hers is the only character that is really striking.
          Her son is a poor creature, as he is meant to be, but he
          does not arrest the reader with the same unmistakable
          reality: his actions are what might be expected, but his
          conversations, especially with Wilson and the Twins, seem
          artificial and forced. Wilson, the nominal hero, appears
          to most advantage in the extracts from his calendar which
          head the chapters, but as a personage he is rather too
          shadowy for a hero. And what has to be said about the
          book must be chiefly about the individuals in it, for the
          story in itself is not much credit to Mark Twain's skill
          as a novelist. The idea of the change of babies is happy,
          and the final trial scene is a good piece of effect; but
          the story at times rambles on in an almost
          incomprehensible way. Why drag in, for example, all the
          business about the election, which is quite irrelevant?
          and the Twins altogether seem to have very little
          <i>raison d'etre</i> in the book. Of course there are
          some funny things in the story, it would not be by Mark
          Twain if there were not, but the humour of the preface
          might very well be spared; it is in bad taste. Still, if
          the preface be skipped the book well repays reading just
          for the really excellent picture of Roxana.</p>
