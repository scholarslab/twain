<p>The dramatization of Mark Twain's "Pudd'nhead Wilson," by Frank Mayo, furnishes an unusually striking play which was reproduced again in St. Paul last night by Edwin Mayo, supported by the same cast, with but few exceptions, which gave it its first appearance here. The famous humorist's most entertaining work has been dramatized in a way which has lost to it none of its original amusing features, and has presented a drama of the greatest power, through which runs an enticing touch of comedy.</p>
<p>Edwin Mayo carries the title role with a simplicity and sincerity that preserve all its humor without ever losing the dignity of its underlying seriousness. His work was comprehensive, strong and finished in every particular. The never failing nonchalance of one who has been all his life misunderstood, yet is conscious of superiority, and the goodness of heart and kindliness of the bachelor lawyer were effectively portrayed. Without exception the act in which, with his niece, he discovers the perfidy and deceit of Tom Driscoll, and demonstrates the innocence of a man accused of murder through the aid of the thumb marks on his bits of glass, the collection of which has been his life-long hobby, was the prettiest, most striking and entertaining of the whole production.</p>
<p>In the character of Roxy, Miss Adelaide Fitz-Allen succeeds Ada Dwyer. Her work in the prologue left a doubt of her ability to effectively portray one of the strongest characters in the play, but in her succeeding work she displayed no little power, and gave an exceedingly difficult characterization in a very satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>William R. McKey's She'f Blake is as delightful as ever with his "o'der in the c'ote."</p>
<p>Of the minor roles, Frank Campeau as Tom Driscoll, Frances Graham Mayo as Rowey [sic], and Menefree Johnstone as Chambers were the great favorites. Mr. Campeau's work as the villain was so effective that in two situations he evoked outspoken expressions of disgust from members of the audience. Mr. Johnstone's work was clever, and in several instances striking. Miss Mayo carried her role with extreme grace, and presented a delightful character in a most satisfactory manner. Louis Wassel and Norman McDonald as the twins were satisfactory. Miss Stoddard as Patsey [sic], Pudd'nhead's widowed sister, made a hit, and furnished an inexhaustible amount of amusement. Edwin Nalod as Jodge Driscoll, and Colin Campbell as Howard Pembroke, a lawyer, were also well received.</p>
<p>"Pudd'nhead Wilson" will continue through the week, with the usual matinees.</p>
