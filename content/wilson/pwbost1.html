        <p>At the Tremont Monday night Frank Mayo presents his
        dramatization of Mark Twain's story, "Pudd'nhead Wilson."
        The tale is that of a simple, great-souled Missourian whose
        neighbors think he amounts to nothing and always will, and
        who turns out to be ingenious. There is said to be much of
        pathos in the humor and quaintness with which this
        character has been transferred to the stage, and there is a
        novelty in substituting for the identifying mole the
        individuality of the thumb-lines.</p>
