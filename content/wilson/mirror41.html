<p>Theodore Hamilton has scored a decided success in Frank Mayo's part in Pudd'nhead Wilson, which enters upon its second and last week at McVicker's to-night. On the opening SUnday night Mr. Jefferson occupied a box, and he wrote Mr. Hamilton one of the most genuine letters of congratulation I have ever read. It would take a large sum of money to purchase that letter from Mr. Hamilton. On the whole, the performance is an excellent one.</p>
