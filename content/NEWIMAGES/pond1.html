[from <i>Eccentricities of Genius</i>,<br>
by Major J. B. Pond]<br><br>

<center><b>Mark Twain and George W. Cable</b></center><br><br>

<p>MARK TWAIN and GEORGE W. CABLE travelled together one season. Twain and Cable, a 
colossal attraction, a happy combination! Mark owned the show, and paid Mr. Cable $600 a week
and his travelling and hotel expenses. The manager took a percentage of the gross receipts for his 
services, and was to be sole manager. If he consulted the proprietor at all during the term of the 
agreement, said agreement became null and void. </p> 

<p>These "twins of genius," as I advertised them, were delightful company. Both were
Southerners, born on the shores of the Mississippi River, and both sang well. Each was familiar
with all the plantation songs and Mississippi River chanties of the negro, and they would often get
to singing these together when by themselves, or with their manager for sole audience.</p>

<p>So delightful were these occasions, and so fond were they of embracing every private
opportunity of "letting themselves out," that I often instructed our carriage driver to take a long
route between hotels and trains that I might have a concert which the public was never permitted
to hear. </p> 

<p>Mr. Cable's singing of Creole songs was very charming and novel. They were so sweet, and
he sang so beautifully, that everybody was charmed, it was all so simple, and quaint, and dignified.</p>
