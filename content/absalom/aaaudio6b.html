 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>Q</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; Did [Sutpen] acknowledge Clytemnestra as his daughter?<br><br>


 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>A</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; Well, that would not have mattered because Clytemnestra was a female.  The important thing to him was he should establish a line of dukes, you see.  He was going to create a dukedom.  He'd have to have a male descendant.  He would have to establish a dukedom which would be his revenge on the white Virginian who told him to go to the back door.  And so he -- to have a Negro, half-Negro, for his son would have wrecked the whole dream.  If he couldn't -- if he had thought that that would ever be exposed, that Bon was his son, he may have killed Bon himself.  If it had ever come to that point, he would have destroyed Bon just as he would have destroyed any other individual who got in his way.<br>
