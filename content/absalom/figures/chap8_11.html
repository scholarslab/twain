Why?</i> since he wanted so little, could have understood if the other had wanted the other to be in secret, would have been quick and glad to let it be in secret even if he could not have understood why, thinking in the middle of this <i>My God, I am young, young, and I didn't even know it; they didn't even tell me, that I was young,</i> feeling that same despair and shame like when you have to watch your father fail in physical courage, thinking <i>It should have been me that failed; me, I, not he who stemmed from that blood which we both bear before it could have become corrupt and tainted by whatever it was in Mother's that he could not brook.--" (pp. 255-57)<br><br>
