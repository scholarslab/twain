"He [Henry] must have known that it would be vain, even then, on that Christmas eve, not to speak of what he learned, saw with his eyes in New Orleans." (p. 72)<br><br>

"and Henry, the countryman, . . . being carried by the friend, the mentor, through one of those inscrutable and curiously lifeless doorways like that before which he had seen the horse or the trap, and so into a place which to his puritan's provincial mind all of morality was upside down and all of honor perished--a place created for and by voluptuousness, the abashless and unabashed senses, and the country boy with his simple and ertswhile untroubled code in which females were ladies or whores or slaves looked at the apotheosis of two doomed races presided over by its own victim--a woman with a face like a tragic magnolia, the eternal female, the eternal Who-suffers; the child, the boy, sleeping in silk and lace to be sure yet complete chattel of him who, begetting him, owned him body and soul to sell (if he chose) like a calf or puppy or sheep;" (pp. 90-91)<br><br>
