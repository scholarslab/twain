 &nbsp; "So he [Bon] went away.  He went away to school at the age of twenty-eight.  And he wouldn't know or care about that either: which of them--mother or lawyer--it was who decided he should go to school nor why, because he had known all the time that his mother was up to something and that the lawyer was up to something, and he didn't care enough about what either of them was to try to find out, . . ." (p. 246)<br><br>

"and one night he walked up the gangplank . . . And who knows what thinking . . . And maybe the letter itself right there under his feet, somewhere in the darkness beneath the deck on which he stood--the letter addressed not to Thomas Sutpen at Sutpen's Hundred but to Henry Sutpen, Esquire, in Residence at the University of Mississippi, near Oxford, Mississippi: and one day Henry showed it to him and there was no gentle spreading glow but a flash, a glare (who not only had no visible father but found himself to be, even in infancy, enclosed by an unsleeping cabal bent apparently on teaching him that he had never had, that his mother had emerged from a sojourn in limbo, from that state of blessed amnesia in which the weak senses can take refuge from the godless dark forces and powers which weak human flesh cannot stand, to wake pregnant, shrieking and screaming and thrashing, not against the ruthless agony of labor but in protest against the outrage of her swelling loins; that he had been fathered on her not through that natural process but had been blotted onto and out of her body by the old infernal immortal male principle of all unbridled terror and darkness) in which he stood looking at the innocent face of the youth almost ten years his junior, while one part of him said <i>My brow my skill my jaw my hands</i> and the other said <i>Wait. Wait.  You cant know yet.  You cannot know whether what you see is what you are looking at or  what you are believing.  Wait. Wait.</i>--the letter which he----" it was not Bon he meant now, yet again Quentin seemed to comprehend without difficulty or effort whom he meant "----wrote maybe as soon as he finished that last entry in the record, into the <i>daughter? daughter? daughter?</i> while he thought <i>By all means he must not know now, must not be told before he can get there and he and the daughter</i>--not remembering anything about young love from his own youth and would not have believed it if he had, yet willing to use that too as he would have used courage and pride, thinking not of any hushed wild importunate blood and light hands hungry for touching, but of the fact that this Oxford and this Sutpen's Hundred were only a day's ride apart and Henry already established in the University and so maybe for once in his life the lawyer even believed in God: . . ."
