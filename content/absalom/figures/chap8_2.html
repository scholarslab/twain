<i>Then one night they had stopped again since Sherman had stopped again, and an orderly came along the bivouac line and found Henry at last and said, 'Sutpen, the colonel wants you in his tent.'</i> (p. 279)<br><br>

 &nbsp; --<i>Yes.  I have decided.  Brother or not, I have decided.  I will. I will.</i> <br>
 &nbsp; --<i>He must not marry her, Henry.</i><br>
 &nbsp; --<i>Yes.  I said Yes at first, but I was not decided then.  I didn't let him.  But now I have had four years to decide in.  I will.  I am going to.</i> <br>
 &nbsp; --<i>He must not marry her, Henry.  His mother's father told me that her mother had been a Spanish woman.  I believed him; it was not until after he was born that I found out that his mother was part negro.</i> (p. 283)<br><br>
