<i>Then one day (he </i>[Bon]<i> was an officer; he would have known, heard, that Lee had detached some troops and sent them down to reinforce them; perhaps he even knew the names and numbers of the regiments before they arrived) he saw Sutpen.  Maybe that first time Sutpen actually did not see him, maybe that first time he could tell himself, 'That was why; he didn't see me,' so that he had to put himself in Sutpen's way, make his chance and situation.  Then for the second time he looked at the expressionless and rocklike face, at the pale boring eyes in which there was no flicker, nothing, the face in which he saw his own features, in which he saw recognition, and that was all. . . . And maybe it was that same night or maybe a night a week later . . . that Bon said, 'Henry' and said, 'It wont be much longer now and then there wont be anything left; . . .' And then Henry would begin to say 'Thank God. Thank God' panting and saying 'Thank God,' saying 'Dont try to explain it.  Just do it' and Bon: 'You authorise me? As her brother you give me permission?' and Henry: 'Brother? Brother? You are the oldest: why do you ask me?' and Bon: 'No. He has never acknowledged me.  He just warned me.  You are the brother and the son.  Do I have your permission, Henry?' and Henry: 'Write.  Write.  Write.'  So Bon wrote the letter, after the four years, and Henry read it and sent it off.</i> (pp. 278-79)<br><br>
