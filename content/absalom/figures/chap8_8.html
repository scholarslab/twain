"Then it was Christmas again, then 1861, and they hadn't heard from Judith because Judith didn't know for sure where they were because Henry wouldn't let Bon write to her yet; then they heard about the company, the University Grays, organising up at Oxford and maybe they had been waiting for that.  So they took the steamboat North again, and more gayety and excitement on the boat now than Christmas even, like it always is when a war starts, before the scene gets cluttered up with bad food and wounded soldiers and widows and orphans, and them taking no part in it now either but standing at the rail again above the churning water, and maybe it would be two or three days, then Henry said suddenly, cried suddenly: 'But kings have done it!  Even dukes!  There was that Lorraine duke named John something that married his sister.  The Pope excommunicated him but it didn't hurt!  It didn't hurt!  They were still husband and wife.  They were still alive.  They still loved!' then again, loud, fast: 'But you will have to wait!  You will have to give me time!  Maybe the war will settle it and we won't need to!'  And maybe this was one place where your old man was right: and they rode into Oxford without touching Sutpen's Hundred and signed the company roster and then hid somewhere to wait, . . ."
