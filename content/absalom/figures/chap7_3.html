 &nbsp; "Maybe he [Wash] even delivered the first string of beads himself, and Father said maybe each of the ribbons afterward during the next three years while the girl matured fast like girls of that kind do; or anyway he would know and recognize each and every ribbon when he saw it on her even when she lied to him about where and how she got it, which she probably did not, . . . But Father said how Wash's heart was still quiet even after he saw the dress and spoke about it, probably only a little grave now and watching her secret defiant frightened face while she told him (before he had asked, maybe too insistent, too quick to volunteer it) that Miss Judith had given it to her, helped her to make it: . . . and Father said how that afternoon Grandfather rode out to see Sutpen about something and there was nobody in the front of the store and he was about to go out and go up to the house when he heard the voices from the back and he walked on toward them and so he overheard them before he could begin to not listen and before he could make them hear him calling Sutpen's name. . . . and Wash standing there, not cringing either, in that attitude dogged and quiet and not cringing, and Sutpen said, 'What about the dress?' and Grandfather said it was Sutpen's voice that was short and sharp: not Wash's; that Wash's voice was just flat and quiet, not abject: just patient and slow: 'I have knowed you for going on twenty years now. I aint never denied yit to do what you told me to do.  And I'm a man past sixty.  And she aint nothing but a fifteen-year-old gal.' and Sutpen said, 'Meaning that I'd harm the girl?  I, a man as old as you are?' and Wash: 'If you was arra other man, I'd say you was as old as me.  And old or no old, I wouldn't let her keep that dress nor nothing else that come from your hand.  But you are different.' and Sutpen: 'How different?' and Grandfather said how Wash did not answer and that he called again now and neither of them heard them; and then Sutpen said: 'So that's why you're afraid of me?' and Wash said, 'I ain't afraid.  Because you are brave. . . . That's where it's different. . . . And I know that whatever your hands tech, where hit's a regiment of men or a ignorant gal or just a hound dog, that you will make hit right.' . . ." (pp. 226-28)<br><br>
