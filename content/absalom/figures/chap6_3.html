 &nbsp; ("How was it?" Shreve said.  "You told me; how was ? you and your father shooting quail, the gray day after it had rained all night and the ditch the horses couldn't cross so you and your father got down and gave the reins to--what was his name? the nigger on the mule?  Luster.--Luster to lead them around the ditch" and he and his father crossed just as the rain began to come down again gray and solid and slow, making no sound, Quentin not aware yet of just where they were because he had been riding with his head lowered against the drizzle, until he looked up the slope before them where the wet yellow sedge dried upward into the rain like melting gold and saw the grove, the clump of cedars on the crest of the hill dissolving in the rain . . . It was dark among the cedars, the light more dark than gray even, the quiet rain, the faint pearly globules, materialising on the gun barrels and the five headstones like drops of not-quite-congealed meltings from cold candles on the marble: the two flat heavy vaulted slabs, the other three headstones leaning a little awry . . .
