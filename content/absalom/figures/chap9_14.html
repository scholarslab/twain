"What is it? something you live and breathe in like air?  a kind of vacuum filled with wraithlike and indomitable anger and pride and glory at and in happenings that occurred and ceased fifty years ago?  a kind of entailed birthright father and son and father and son of never forgiving General Sherman, so that forever more as long as your children's children produce children you wont be anything but a descendant of a long line of colonels killed in Pickett's charge at Manassas?"<br>
 &nbsp; "Gettysburg," Quentin said. (p. 289)<br><br>
