"Then it was Shiloh, the second day and the lost battle and the brigade falling back from Pittsburg Landing----And listen," Shreve cried; "wait, now; wait!" (glaring at Quentin, panting himself, as if he had to supply his shade not only with a cue but with breath to obey it in): "Because your old man was wrong here, too!  He said it was Bon who was wounded, but it wasn't.  Because who told him?  Who told Sutpen, or your grandfather either, which of them it was who was hit? Sutpen didn't know because he wasn't there, and your grandfather wasn't there either because that was where he was hit too, where he lost his arm.  So who told them?  Not Henry, because his father never saw Henry but that one time and maybe they never had time to talk about wounds and besides to talk about wounds in the Confederate army in 1865 would be like coal miners talking about soot; and not Bon, because Sutpen never saw him at all because he was dead;--it was not Bon, it was Henry; Bon that found Henry at last and stooped to pick him up and Henry fought back, struggled, saying, 'Let be! Let me die!  I wont have to know it then' and Bon said, 'So you do want me to go back to her' and Henry lay there struggling and panting, with the sweat on his face and his teeth bloody inside his chewed lip, and Bon said, 'Say you do want me to go back to her.  Maybe then I wont do it.  Say it' and Henry lay there struggling, with the fresh red staining through his shirt and his teeth showing and the sweat on his face until Bon held his arms and lifted him onto his back----" (p. 275)<br><br>
