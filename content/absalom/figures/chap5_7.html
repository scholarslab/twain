<i>I will tell you what he did and let you be the judge.  (Or try to tell you, because there are some things for which three words are three too many, and three thousand words that many words too less, and this is one of them.

Why? and Why? that I have asked and listened to for almost fifty years.)</i>  (pp. 134-35)<br><br>
