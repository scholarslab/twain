 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>Q</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; Mr. Faulkner, along this respectability-scoundrel line, how do you explain Colonel Sutpen, who sweeps into Jefferson and grimly sets himself up and at long last decides he'll have respectability . . . ?  Does he really lose his individuality or isn't this respectability just another notch in his rifle, so to speak?<br><br>


 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>A</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; He wanted more than that.  He wanted revenge as he saw it, but also he wanted to establish the fact that man is immortal, that man, if he is man, cannot be inferior to another man through artificial standards or circumstances.  What he was trying to do -- when he was a boy, he had gone to the front door of a big house and somebody, a servant, said, Go around to the back door.  He said, I'm going to be the one that lives in the big house, I'm going to establish a dynasty, I don't care how, and he violated all the rules of decency and honor and pity and compassion, and the fates took revenge on him.  That's what that story was.  But he was trying to say in his blundering way that, Why should a man be better than me because he's richer than me, that if I had had the chance I might be just as good as he thinks he is, so I'll make myself as good as he thinks he is by getting the same outward trappings which he has, which was a big house and servants in it.  He didn't say, I'm going to be braver or more compassionate or more honest than he -- he just said, I'm going to be as rich as he was, as big as he was on the outside.
