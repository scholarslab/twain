Page would start with blank background, then this word would emerge (as the "text clips" emerge in chapter chronologies):<br>
<center><img src="figures/splash1a.jpg"></center><br>
Then after first word comes into focus, second word would appear, joining it to look like this:<br>
<center><img src="figures/splash1b.jpg"></center><br>
Then third word, joining the first two:<br>
<center><img src="figures/splash1c.jpg"></center><br>
First three words would be scans of Faulkner's handwriting, but last two words would in in our own (clearly not manuscript) fonts, something like this:<br>
<center><img src="figures/splash1d.jpg"></center><br>
Then last word would appear, joining the other four, to make whole title come into focus as this:<br>
<center><img src="figures/splash1e.jpg"></center><br>
Then if possible below this title, a brief credit for you and me, identifying the academic source of the program, etc, followed by either a menu of links (CREDITS, FLASH PROGRAM, INSTRUCTIONS, SOUND FILES, ETC.) or a single link, something like BEGIN, which would lead to a page with the other links, some text, etc.
