 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>Q</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; I'd like to go back to Charles Bon in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>  I have the impression that up until very near the end of the book that he does not realize he is part Negro. . . . At what point does he find this out and how does he find it out?<br><br>


 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>A</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; I think that Bon knew all the time that his mother was part Negress, but during Bon's childhood that was not important.  He grew up in the Indies or in New Orleans where that wasn't too important.  His mother was a wealthy woman.  She could have called herself a Creole whether she had Negro blood along with the French or not.  It became important only when Bon realized that it was important to his father.  I think that Bon got into that business -- well, of course, because he formed a friendship with Henry and felt that Henry, the ignorant country boy, had given him a sort of worship, an admiration and a worship which he enjoyed.  Then when he saw the sort of stiff-necked man that Henry's father was and knew that that was his father too, he in a way had given his father a chance to say, I will acknowledge you, but if you -- if I do openly and you stay here, you will wreck what I have devoted my life to, and so take my love and go, I think Bon would have done it.  But this old man was afraid to do that.  And Bon tempted him to hold him over the coals in -- partly in revenge on his treatment of his -- Bon's -- mother, until Bon got involved too deeply.  No, Bon knew that he was a Negro, but until he found it was important to Sutpen, that wasn't important to him.  That he was a gentleman, had been well bred, cultured, much better bred and cultured than Henry himself was.
