 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>Q</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; Mr. Faulkner, the central theme of <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is that Sutpen will not or cannot acknowledge Charles Bon as his son. Why does he not do this, why does he leave it to Henry?  It seems to me it would have been more in keeping with Sutpen's character if he had acknowledged Bon, or if he had destroyed Bon if he felt that he needed to.<br><br>


 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>A</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; Well, he didn't acknowledge Bon for the reason that Bon was part Negro.  To have acknowledged Bon as his son would have destroyed the very dream, the drive which had compelled him to go through hardship and suffering to gain it.  He couldn't acknowledge Bon as his son.<br>
