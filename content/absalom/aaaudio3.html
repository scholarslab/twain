 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>Q</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; Mr. Faulkner, Mr. Coldfield in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> retreats into the attic when the War between the States starts.  Now, why did he do that?  Was it because he was a sort of conscientious objector, or was he all or part coward?<br><br>


 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font size=-1><b>A</b></font><b>.</b> &nbsp; No, he was probably by religious scruples a conscientious objector.  Also, he was very likely a Unionist.  That he hated that threat to the dissolution of the Union.  That he hadn't enough courage to do anything about it except to hide his head in the sand.  But I think that he was probably a Unionist.  He probably came from eastern Tennessee, where the people were Unionists at that time.  His background was a tradition of fidelity to the United States as it was.  He had no agrarian tradition behind him in which slavery was an important part of it.
