To list a directory:


	ls (short list)

	ls -l (long list)

	One screen at a time (to go forward, hit the space bar)

	ls | more

	ls -l | more 

To change permissions:


For a file to be "viewable" on the web it must be readable by all :

Every file and directory has three levels of permission:  

	owner / group / everyone

and three possibilities:

	read / write / execute

FILE

So, for a file to be usable on the web it must be readable (but not a
good idea to make it executable OR writeable by the rest of the world).


	-rw-r--r--   1 sfr      twain       1801 Apr 10 1997  znhhp.html

	- rw-  r--  r--   1 sfr      twain       1801 Apr 10 1997  znhhp.html

This is owned by sfr and is rw (read/write) by him

This is in the twain group, and the group can read but not write to it

The rest of the world can read but not write to it


DIRECTORY

A directory needs to be both readable and executable by the world (but
not writeable).

	drwxrwxr-x   2 sfr    twain       1024 Oct 31 10:40 uncletom

TO CHANGE PERMISSIONS

	To add executable permission to a directory:

	chmod a+x NAME OF DIRECTORY


	To add read permission to a file:

	chmod a+r NAME OF FILE


	To do this globally, 

	chmod a+r *


	To do this globally, only on jpegs

	chmod a+r *.jpg
