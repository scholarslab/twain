<hr>
The literary critic is often puzzled how to classify the intellectual
phenomena that come within his ken. His business is of course primarily
with <i>literature</i>. A work may be infinitely amusing, it may abound
even with flashes and touches of genius, and yet the form in which it
comes into the world may be so crude, so coarse, so erring from the ways
of true classicism, so offensive to immemorial canons of taste, that the
critic, in spite of his enjoyment and wonder, puts it reluctantly down in
the category of unclassifiable literary things only to take it up and
enjoy it again! 

<p>

Of such is Pudd'nhead Wilson, and, for that matter, Mark Twain in general.
The author is a signal example of sheer genius, without training or
culture in the university sense, setting forth to conquer the world with
laughter whether it will or no, and to get himself thereby acknowledged to
be the typical writer of the West. He is the most successful of a class of
American humorists whose impulse to write off their rush of animal spirits
is irresistible, and who snatch at the first pen within reach as the
conductor of their animal electricity. If we look at other national
humorists, like Aristophanes, Cervantes, Moliere or Swift, we find their
humor expressed in an exquisite literary form, in which a certain polish
tempers the extravagance, and annoying metrical (or it may be imaginative)
difficulties have been overcome. What wonderful bird-rhythms and wasp
melodies and cloud-architecture, so to speak, emerge from the marvellous
choral interludes of the Greek comedian; what suave literary graces
enclose the gaunt outlines of Don Quixote; in what honeyed verse are
Alceste and Tartuffe entangled, and what new, nervous, powerful prose
describes the adventures of Gulliver! When we turn our eyes westward we
encounter Judge Haliburton, Hosea Biglow, Uncle Remus, Mark Twain an
absolutely new genre distinct from what we had previously studied in the
line of originalities. The one accomplished artist among these is Lowell,
whose university traditions were very strong and controlled his bubbling
humor. The others are pure 'naturalists' men of instinctive genius, who
have relied on their own conscious strength to produce delight in the
reader, irrespective of classicity of form, literary grace or any other of
the beloved conventions on which literature as literature has hitherto
depended. This is true in a less degree of Uncle Remus than of Judge
Haliburton and Mark Twain. 

<p>

Pudd'nhead Wilson is no 'exception to the rule. It is a Missouri tale of
changelings 'befo' the wah,' admirable in atmosphere, local color and
dialect, a drama in its way, full of powerful situations, thrilling even;
but it cannot be called in any sense literature. In it Mark Twain's
brightness and grotesqueness and funniness revel and sparkle, and in the
absurd extravaganza, 'Those Extraordinary Twins,' all these comicalities
reach the buffoon point; one is amused and laughs unrestrainedly but then
the irksome question comes up: What is this? is it literature? is Mr.
Clemens a 'writer' at all? must he not after all be described as an
admirable after-dinner storyteller humorous, imaginative, dramatic, like
Dickens who in an evil moment, urged by admiring friends, has put pen to
paper and written down his stories? Adapted to the stage and played by
Frank Mayo, the thing has met with immediate success.
