<i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>.  By Mark Twain.  London: Chatto & Windus. 1894.
	Mark Twain's last book is a story of mixed babies and the 
ingenious detection of crime.  It is not altogether another 
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i>.  On the other hand, it is a relief to find that 
it is not another <i>Yankee at King Arthur's Court</i>.  Roxy, the slave 
woman, who changes the babies, is a delightful character, who stirs us 
with a warm and ready interest.  For the rest, there is little that can 
be said to rouse enthusiasm.  Pudd'nhead Wilson himself is a little 
unreal, too much of the <i>deus ex machina</i>, though there is much that 
is Twainian in the specimen sayings that illustrate his wisdom.  Every 
chapter is headed with these extracts, and it is clear that Pudd'nhead 
Wilson is to Mark Twain what Poor Richard was to Franklin.  In the means 
by which Wilson detects the murderer of Judge Driscoll we have an 
ingenious adaptation of the system of thumb-impressions, originated by 
Sir W. Herschell in India, as a method of identifying criminals.  It is 
cleverly, if not entirely persuasively, worked out in the story.  But the 
sketch of Roxy, the negress, is by far the finest thing in the book.
