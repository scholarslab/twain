 &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the best-sellers we'll read remained popular long after they were first published, but all of them were written at specific historical moments.  In order for our discussions to include some sense of the contemporary cultural and historical context for each text, for every other novel all semester, beginning with the second one we read, Cooper's <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>, part of your mission will be to research the year the novel was published and bring back one specific fact about that year, or a year in the immediate vicinity of it.  For example, <i>Mohicans</i> was published in 1826.  In 1825, the Erie Canal through New York State was completed and opened to shipping, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean.  Whether and how that event may be relevant to the cultural meaning of Cooper's novel is something we could talk about in class.<br><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; There are obviously lots of places to look for these historical facts, from newspapers in Alderman's microfilm room to history texts to online sources, and so on.  It's not your task to decide if or how the information you find is relevant to the novel we'll be discussing -- just to learn something about that past moment, and report your finding to the class.  You'll do that by e-mailing me what you've come up with in a sentence or two, <b>by 8 p.m. of the day before we begin talking about the novel</b>.  Half the class at a time will be responsible for finding these historical facts, which means you'll do this five times during the semester.   <i>Below</i> is the schedule for these investigations.  There are two dates after each novel: first, its publication date; second, the day I'll expect your e-mails.  Good hunting.<br><br>
