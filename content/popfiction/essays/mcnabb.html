<blockquote>Reading is, to me, a completely engrossing activity in 
general. I tend to be an intense reader, becoming completely 
engulfed by a book. I prefer to read a book all at once in its 
entirety, regardless of length. Because I love to take in a book all 
at once, I tend to be completely immersed, and completely oblivious 
to anything else. While Im in the middle of the book the whole my 
attention is spent on that work. I tend to be an impatient reader 
and it rarely takes me more than a day to finish any book. Only 
after the fact can I savor the writing, the story, or the 
characters, so it often ends that I re-read a book or parts of a 
book countless times.  Depending on my mood, I find a familiar book 
just as (if not more) enjoyable than a new one.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>I also tend to read books in groups or sets, by author, 
or genre. If Ive at all enjoyed an author I tend to have read all 
of his/her works and often all in a row. Or, Ill become interested 
in a certain genre or type of book and for a while all my selections 
will fall into that category.</blockquote>
<blockquote> Because of the way I like to read my books I tend to do 
my major pleasure reading on vacations, whether sitting on the dock 
in New Hampshire, or on the beach at Nantucket, or curled up in a 
large chair. I go on vacation prepared to read a lot, and I look 
forward to being able to indulge myself. Still, during the year, I 
read whenever I have a spare moment. There are certain times when I 
just crave a book - and though sometimes this can be distracting - 
often it provides just the break I needed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Although I love variety and will really read anything, I 
do have my guilty passions - I adore mysteries, science 
fiction/fantasy, and childrens literature. Mysteries I have loved 
since childhood and Nancy Drew. I read them in mass quantity. 
Science fiction and fantasies I probably got initially from my 
father, and I still look to him for suggestions. I have always had a 
soft spot for Childrens lit. and I dont think having younger 
siblings is the cause of it (as I am far more likely to read 
anything than they are.) But my pleasure reading is by no means 
relegated to these categories and I will read anything that strikes 
my fancy or that has been recommended to me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When Im choosing a book I really look for anything that

catches my eye, whether it is a familiar title (from a 
recommendation) or a familiar author, or an interesting first page. 
I often go shopping in my parents bookshelves - they have a
large 
selection and tremendous variety. (I come from a family of voracious 
readers.) But I can, and do, spend hours in the bookstore. Because I 
like to re-read my books I like to own them, rather than borrow them 
from the library.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I really cannot remember not liking, not wanting to 
read. I have always enjoyed reading as long as I can remember and my 
habits regarding my books have remained fairly constant. I have 
always read a fair amount, always read my books whole (all at once), 
and focused in on certain types of books. Today perhaps, I read with 
a bit more variety, but little else has changed. Certainly my love 
of books and m love of reading has remained constant. </blockquote>
