By Joshua Bradley</font></center><br>

<blockquote>There was a time once, years ago, when I read for
pleasure far more than I do now. Perhaps the increased complexity
and busyness that comes with growing up has

shoved aside some of my older habits; or perhaps the novelty of
novels has worn off over the years, encouraged by the constant
demands for academic reading rather than for

mere enjoyment. But even with these factors, reading is still a
cherished part of my life, although I find myself enjoying it far
less frequently.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My ideal book revolves around an average person who,
despite their normality, embarks on a journeyin the physical or the

mindand proceeds to become a hero or

legend. While the adventure genre mostfrequently embodies this
ideal,  I enjoy reading all types of novels, whether they be fantasy
or historical, as long as they embody this basic

plot. Although many of these books, especially the more modern ones,
have received little critical acclaim (Tolkiens <i>Lord of the
Rings</i> being a notable exception), they are still

highly regarded by myself; what they lack in being literary
masterpieces, they make up for with a soul I find particularly
enjoyable. Most of the pleasure reading I do these days

comes from books of this type, and whenever I need something new to
read, I journey down the long isles of Barnes & Noble, hunting for
new novels by favorite authors or a cover

that strikes me in some way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But all the books in the world are useless without the
time to read them. And for the college student such as myself, time
is a precious commodity while school is in

session. It is only natural, therefore, that a mass of novels would
build up next to my bed during the semester, each one begging to be
read, yet forced to be deferred until time is

once again available. For me, that time always arrives in early May,
when another year of school has come to an end, and an entire summer
lies before me. During every free

afternoon, Ill donate some timeranging from fifteen minutes to
hours on endto reading each book, one at a time (sometimes
characters have unusual, unpronounceable

names, and so to read more than one at a time is just asking for
confusion, at least in my opinion). I almost never read in the
morning or evening, as my brain is slightly groggy

during those times, and I consider it an injustice to the authors to
read their books while not fully conscious. </blockquote>

<blockquote>To complement this lazy afternoon habit of reading, my
favorite spot to engage a good book is my bed. I love to lie there,
with the sun sometimes peaking through the

trees and the only sound being the occasional chirping of a bird,
breaking the peaceful stillness of the countryside. With such
serenity around me, the book has little trouble

engaging me to the fullest, each word ringing out in the depths of
my mind. And the best part of this location is that when my eyes
grow weary orheaven forbid!I grow bored of

what Im reading, I can simply lay back and take a nap, a peaceful
way to journey back from the world I was visiting to the real
world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I think that journey, that voyage to an uncharted land,
is why I read for pleasure in the first place. In comparison to my
own life, the protagonists of these adventure

stories lead extremely exciting lives; such tales capture my
imagination. And more than just being a story of this particular
character, they become a part of myself. If this person,

who is so very average, can become entwined in a much grander
purpose and realize how truly unique and special they are, then why
can I not also, despite my own normality, find

my adventure in the real world? These stories tell me that I can,
that I too may become a part in my own little legend. And thats why

I read what I do, where I do: pleasure reading is

a little vessel that helps me to cross the oftentimes tumultuous
seas of this world and reach the harbor of purpose I long for.
