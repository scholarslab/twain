<blockquote>As a child, the highlight of my Sunday morning was found 
in the glossy pages of the funny papers.  Sitting in my mother's or 
father's lap, I would listen to the story accompanying the bright 
illustrations with delight.  But one day my mother informed me that 
she would only be reading me two comics; if I wanted to know what 
words accompanied the other strips, I would have to learn to read 
them myself.  And that was the beginning of my love affair with 
reading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Never a task for me, my friends would always be shocked 
at my love of a good book.  When my friends wouldn't touch a book 
without pictures, I would relish the rainy days when I could curl up 
with a <i>chapter book</i>.  I really thought this made me cool--
thank god I was nave enough not to realize just how sad my obsession 
could be: many a night my mom would have to take my book from me when 
she found me huddled under the covers with a flashlight.  And would 
have to move it into her room when I had taken it back from the 
hallway when she turned off her light.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I always have had a way of getting lost in a good novel.  
The types of books I read have changed over the years, but still I 
read in the same manner.  My head clears of everything that happens 
in my own, often hectic, world to immerse myself in the book's world; 
reading is my yoga, my meditation.  But this total immersion has 
caused problems as of late.  I cannot make the commitment to a novel 
that I cannot put down.  Thank god for short stories: they give me my 
hit without keeping me up all night, turning page after page into the 
early morning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But occasionally, I find myself with the luxury of enough 
time to read a real book, guilt-free, or simply must do so.   My 
choice of novel...  Sporadic.  Sometimes it's <i>literature</i>, 
sometimes a spy novel, sometimes a mystery.  I read the Harry Potter 
books when the bookstore is empty and no one sees me buy them.  I 
seem to find myself mostly reading a genre of books I like to 
call "Young Women Trying to Get Their Shit Together."  <i>Bridget 
Jones Diary</i>, <i>Confessions of a Shopaholic</i>, <i>A Girl's 
Guide to Hunting and Fishing</i>, these are the books that my friends 
suggest to me.  These are the books I find myself 
reading.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Like any genre, there are certain common charachteristics 
to all of these books.  The main character is  age 22-30.  She is not 
an ugly girl, but nor is she a beauty.  She has a dead end job.  Her 
friends are few and often not supportive enough.  Ditto her family.  
She never has a boyfriend.  She is searching through the fog for the 
path to the rest of her life, but somehow keeps getting lost along 
the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>By the end of the book, she has achieved two or more of 
the following: made herself over, found a good job, made better 
friends, reconciled with her family, found a man.  In any case, the 
book ends on a note that suggests that she is finally on that path to 
the rest of her life.  While reading these books, I find them 
humorous.  But as that I am graduating in May and still have no job, 
etc., I think that they are adding to my own neuroses.  And spy 
novels are out as well, with the impending conflict in the Middle 
East.  So I guess I still have mystery novels.  And I hear that the 
new Harry Potter is coming out soon.</blockquote>
