<blockquote>Reading has always been an essential activity in my life.
 Growing up, I was never allowed to watch television during the week,
and thus was forced to seek other methods of entertainment.
Encouraged by my parents, I quickly took to reading and developed a
voracious appetite for books.  For whatever reason, I found that
reading came naturally, and as a result was always a very precocious
reader.  By 6th and 7th grade, I had read many of the <i>classics</i>
that would end up being assigned in both high school and college.  I
went book by book through my parents library, filling my childhood
with Dickens, Hemingway, and Dumas.  I would read any chance I got,
including during class, under the desk while the teacher was talking,
prompting my 4th grade teacher to send home a letter asking my
parents instruct me on the <i>correct</i> times to be reading.  While
I cant say for certain, I think that I read such literature at that
time because it presented a challenge.  It was something beyond what
all the other kids were doing, and I wanted to see if I could handle
these <i>famous</i> books.  While in retrospect I can see that, at
that age, I was really unable to get much more out of those novels
than their basic plots, I think reading such books enabled me to
appreciate them all the more as I got older. </blockquote>

<blockquote>However, once I reached the age where those books were
being assigned regularly, I found myself looking for another way to
satiate my literary appetite.  I sampled many different genres until
I came across a fantasy series called <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, by
Robert Jordan.  I can still remember, back in 10th grade, staying up
all night to finish reading the first book, and knowing that I had
found what I was looking for in pleasure reading.  From then on, I
was hooked.   The imaginary worlds brought to life in those novels
became a place where I could go to escape the mundane routine of the
day.  I even found that if I was angry or depressed, I could, for the
time I was reading, escape reality and thus leave my problems behind.
 I soon found myself in the midst of six or seven different series,
eagerly waiting, year after year, for the next new installment in
each. </blockquote>

<blockquote>On another level, I think I took to the fantasy genre
because the stories are usually set in a feudal, medieval-style
world.  I love history, and my favorite area of concentration is the
European middle ages.  And while simply studying this time period is
enjoyable, I have always wished I could go back in time and see what
it was like to be a champion knight, or a powerful king.  Thus
through the fantasy stories, I am able to transport myself back
through time and combine history with imagination.</blockquote>
