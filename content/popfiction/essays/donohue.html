By Terry Donohue</font></center><br> 

<font size=+1>
<blockquote>I have to admit that Im something of a snob in regards 
to the books I read or at least the books I want to read.  Ive 
always turned my nose up at the very mention of names like Crichton, 
Grisham and Seuss.  As an English major consideration of books for 
leisurely reading has become a task complicated by the type of 
deconstructive thinking fostered by the English Major.  As a 
consequence I find myself rejecting titles based on a deplorable 
predilection for the high brow.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This prejudiced predilection only really becomes a 
problem when I find myself in books stores, haughtily rolling my 
eyes at titles that have been made into movies (unless of course 
they were high brow movies) in search of something genuinely 
erudite.  When I find it, a book that satisfies my own inflated 
sense of self-importance, something with a buzz-word name on it like 
Rushdie, Nabokov or Vonegut- I buy it, I bring it home, leaving it 
somewhere where my parents are sure to see it and wonder at how 
lucky they are to have a son like me.  Then, reluctantly, I begin to 
read it, trying not to crease the binding.  I read for about 20 
minutes before I realize Im hungry.  I fix myself a snack and sit 
down in front of the television, swearing to myself that I am to 
watch television only until my snack is finished at which point I am 
to return to my newly purchased masterpiece.  The snack finished I 
continue to sit watching television, flipping back and forth between 
Comedy Central and MTV (though I hate to admit it.  Its dreadfully 
low brow you know) and convincing myself against all logic that the 
snack isnt finished until Ive digested it and when that happens
it 
should be high time for a nap-the comforst of which I take, without 
either fail or apology.</blockquote>  

<blockquote>The book sits, spread open on page 14, taunting my own 
irresolute snobbery with its knowing eyes-the front and back 
covers.  I try not to look at the book, which just sits there 
complacent and snide, until I cant take it anymore at which point I

close it, oftentimes for good, having never ventured past the 14th 
page.</blockquote>  

<blockquote>Sometimes I pick it up later (either in the day or in 
the year), and when I finally do make my way past the first 14 pages 
an into the last, I feel a sense of relief that had been waiting for 
me since the day I first bought it.  I cant avoid feeling shame 
when I look at a book that I have bought but never read.  I once 
picked up a copy of Crime and Punishment for five dollars when I was 
on vacation.  I still sits on my shelf and even as I look at it now 
I cant imagine whats going to happen on page 20 because though 
Ive opened it several times since that initial time, Ive never 
been able to bring myself past page 19.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Something always seems to get in the way.  During school 
I can never justify reading something for fun when I am deliberately 
not reading something for class.  So, when I am asked to read the 
introduction to the Norton Anthology of Criticism, and when I 
discard any inkling I had to actually read it the last thing I can 
imagine doing is reading something else.  Usually, the only safe way 
for me to avoid feelings of guilt is for me to snack, or nap, or 
watch T.V. or sometimes, usually, all three.  Im very high-brow in 
that way.</blockquote>  

<blockquote>I know its a shame, not reading as much as I should 
that is.  My father told me that this is the last opportunity Ill 
have in my life to be encouraged to fall in love with words.  I 
always chalked his poetic sensibility up as being cheesy and 
melodramatic, but now, in my fourth year at the University I can 
feel the sands of time dropping from beneath my feet and I can 
almost understand my fathers meaning.  Ive always loved reading,

but I can never seem to find the right thing to read.  Recently, 
though, the dilemma became more clear to me and Ive come to the 
resolution that it doesnt matter what I read, be it a history book 
or The Lord of the Rings or a Dr. Seuss story or an article in 
Newsweek (and most certainly not People magazine, and especially not 
the 50 most beautiful people issue, and especially not the Style 
Watch section.  I am terribly High Brow, you see, and I dont even 
know what all that People Magazine nonsense is).  So long as
Im 
reading Im feeding my mind and not my gut, which, thanks to several

years worth of snacking and napping, has now become something of a 
masterpiece in its own right.</blockquote>
