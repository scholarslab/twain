Confessions of a Former Cover Boy
<blockquote>When I was a kid, I used to think the old
saying "never judge a book by its cover" was a bunch of
<i>bullshit</i>( I would have said "crap", but a) Mr.
Railton used this other word on the first day of class, so I
figured I could use it in my first essay, b) this is
probably the one time in my life I will be able to use it
in a written assignment, and c) I figure using it in the
first sentence will prevent me from being guilty of writing
any B.S. for the remainder of the essay);  I almost always
chose what books to read by the appearance of their covers.
In elementary school, my teachers would hand out catalogs
from reading clubs like Troll or Scholastic, complete with
color pictures of captivating book covers. Perhaps my
over-exposure to TV attracted me to the bright graphics,
along with the paintings and cartoon-like drawings of
trouble-making kids and troubled parents, crime fighters
and solvers, scary monsters and evil aliens, big red dogs
and curious monkeys. I would circle all the selections that
caught my eye, hoping my mom would let me order all eight
or nine of them, since reading was more productive than
playing with Ninja Turtle toys (but looking back at those
cheap, plastic action figures, it probably took more
imagination to play with <i>them</i>).  Then there were the
school-wide book fairs, with tables upon tables of books (I
was "gifted and talented," so I could read Reading Level 6
books in the fourth grade---wow).  I would think that book
titles, or perhaps the brief blurbs on the back cover,
played a big role in my selection process too.  But, this
could not have been the case, since I remember once
accidentally buying a Baby-Sitter's Club book, probably for
nothing more than the "gnarly" checkered design around the
border.  Because of this superficial criteria, I ended up
reading everything from Encyclopedia Brown books to those
by Beverly Cleary.  The genres covered  action/ adventure
(of which I often "chose my own"), detective, sports,
history and historical fiction,  and comedy, but what
almost all of the books had in common was the use of
children as the narrators and characters.  My favorite
books were probably the pre-teen adolescent dramas of
S. E. Hinton and the outlandish comedies and adventures
by Roald Dahl, Judy Blume, and Robert Kimmel Smith.  I was
a book worm and the hungry fishes at HarperCollins and
Penguin Putnam would have eaten me alive had it not been
for my trusty library card.  In third grade, my teacher
Mrs. Finley held a reading auction, in which she gave us
fake money for every book we read and wrote a summary
about, all of which could be used to buy toys, games, and
gadgets, at an auction at the end of the quarter.  The more
we read, the more we could buy.  Since Santa never brought
me what I wanted anyway, I decided to read a different book
every day for four months, and earn $750 worth of Monopoly
money (I swear I had friends, though).  Sometimes,
teachers, librarians, and FRIENDS would recommend a book,
or if I liked a certain book, I would read other works by
that author.  But, when it came down to it, I was a cover
whore.  Then came high school.  </blockquote>
<blockquote>At this stage of my life, two major phenomena
needed to be factored in: that thing they call "homework"
and those things that keep you from getting to it until
9:00 at night called "extra-curricular activities."  This
is when the time I had to read "for pleasure" became almost
non-existent.  I was reading endless pages of science,
history, and math textbooks every day, on top of bulky
literary classics for my English classes, and this was
after a seven-hour school day and three-hour lacrosse
practice.  At the same time, though, I actually liked most
of the novels I had to read for class.  The authors we read
could get away with a lot more now that I was a "mature"
young adult..  By sophomore year, my English teacher could
get away with calling Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" "orgasmic."
By junior year, I was being introduced to the great
American works like <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>,
<i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>Catcher in the
Rye</i>.  I can tell you one thing: James and his friends
in the Giant Peach were never getting drunk off of absinthe
or calling up prostitutes.  This is the point where I began
to realize that there were too many classic masterpieces out
there to be reading contemporary works in my free time.
These periods of leisure were soon limited to breaks and
trips, at which point I would read other works by writers
like Hemingway and Faulkner, on the beach or during long car
rides and airplane flights.  I liked to read "important"
works, books that were revolutionary in their style or
subject matter.  With novels like <i>A Farewell to
Arms</i> and <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>,
as well as a personal love of traveling and experiencing, I
began to take a liking for works about lost souls, drifters
who feel out of place in their own surroundings, so they
take off to distant lands to find themselves.  I'm no
"melancholy man," and I'm not really a pessimist, but I am
incredibly cynical and sarcastic.  The narrators I
preferred were not necessarily depressed, either, although
they were disillusioned with much about their contemporary
governments and societies; moreover, they often had a
seeming lust for life.  I like a novel that can take an
everyday conversation or situation and make it humorous or
revealing simply in recalling it sarcastically or pointing
things out that most people would not notice.  With this
outlook, I purchased and read Kerouac's <i>On the Road</i> the summer
after graduation, and it quickly became my favorite book, as
it embodied many of my idealistic and cynical adolescent
views.  It also turned me on to the other writers of the
Beat Generation.  Then I got to college.  </blockquote>
<blockquote>My trend at "the University," in terms of what
I read has generally remained the same, except that there
is even more reading, especially as an English major.  In
fact, there are some classes that even require the reading
of 1000-plus-paged works like <i>Gone With the Wind</i>
(imagine that!�just kidding). My time constraints have not
gotten any better, either, as I have taken on various
extra-curricular activities and a job. My reading
preferences become more important in picking what classes
to take, more than anything.  Consequently, the extent of
my reading for pleasure during the semester often consists
of <i>The Cavalier Daily</i>, <i>the Declaration</i>,
and (dare I say it) <i>Maxim</i> (remember, I promised no
B.S. in line 4) since I already get my fiction fix in my
English classes.  It is usually only during winter and
summer breaks that I pick up a book on my own, reading on
trips, outside on my back porch, or in bed before sleeping.
I still rarely read any contemporary works or bestsellers,
and someone shoot me the day I read a Harry Potter book.
The current books I do read are generally political in
nature, such as the essays of Arundhati Roy, or the
collected news articles of Hunter S. Thompson, again going
with my skeptical nature.  Even here, though, I was
introduced to Roy from reading <i>The God of Small
Things</i>, her "groundbreaking novel," for three different
classes.  So, other than the occasional review from a
friend, I usually read a book based on an author's other
works, most of which I learn about from classes I have
taken.  The books I read are almost always from the
twentieth century, as I feel I can relate more closely to
them, with the '20s existentialists and the Beat writers of
the '50s and '60s being my favorites.  They are usually
works of realism and modernism, and never works of fantasy.
This brings me to my next and last point and, what I get out
of what I read. </blockquote>
<blockquote>For me, part of
the pleasure in reading lies in the interiority of a book,
being able to get into a character's head.  Accordingly, as
with movies, I prefer works that are not overly concerned
with plot, and instead, concerned with character
development, to the point that I feel like I know the
people described by the end.  In being able to relate to a
set of characters, I can trust them, then put myself in
their shoes and go on journeys of adventure or revelation
with them, and do things I long to do, but am not able to,
such as party at a speak-easy or hitchhike to San
Francisco.  I could never be as reckless and daring as Dean
Moriarty in <i>On the Road</i>, but, especially since he's
based on a real person (Neal Cassady, a friend of the author),
 he inspires me to want to take
risks and (cough---clich�!) follow my heart, regardless of
what others say.  I likewise enjoy reading about or in
the voice of society's deviants, interesting people who
think outside the mainstream.  Just as important, though,
is style and diction, which is where a work can most obviously
stand out as a work of art.  I love a book that can describe
something as mundane as a paper clip, and bring a whole new
world of meaning to it, a book in which you can  <i>feel</i> every
word just by its use of rich vocabulary. Similarly, I love
a book in which I can just underline quotes and bits of
"life-sayings" or philosophies that can describe a
sentiment I have felt, or am feeling at the time; there is
a quote about expatriates in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>,
which seemed to sum up my attitude throughout my entire trip to Paris and Spain
last summer.  A good novel can be a <i>Chicken Soup for the
Soul</i> without trying to be.  I find fulfillment in
reading about something that I can relate to, and then
being able to see it in a whole new light, or just
articulate something in the words I could never find.  In
the end, it probably all comes back to feeling.  If a book
truly moves me, it is more powerful than its own words can
describe.  Sometimes it is just satisfying to know someone
else has felt the way I do, even if they were misunderstood
their whole lives.  My own deviant side can then come out.
Just like my overdone English major side has come out over
the last (sorry!) 1,748 words.  </blockquote>
