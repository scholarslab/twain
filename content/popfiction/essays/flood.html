<blockquote> Looking back through all the different stages
I went through, I feel like I can position and identify
myself by what I was reading at the time.  I remember being
a little girl and memorizing the short books my mom used to
read to me so that I could "read" along with her by looking
at the pictures to see where we were in the story.
<i>Cinderella</i> was my favorite story that we would read
together.  I wanted to be just as smart as my older
brother, who was already reading, and reading with my mom
made me feel like I was catching up to him.  As I moved
into elementary school, I became addicted to the
<i>Baby-Sitter Club</i> series.  My mom became annoyed at
constantly having to buy me a new book (as those books were
easy to finish inside one evening), and encouraged visits
to the local library.  That was the beginning of a
broadening of books I read for fun.  As I grew older, I
became more influenced by what my friends were reading,
which series they were getting into, and also books my
brother and sister read.  The <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> series
were great favorites during this time, as many of my
friends were reading them as well.  I loved reading things
that had continuing stories, with familiar characters and
plot lines. The <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> books were wonderful
to read again and again because I could jump into different
stages and parts of her life, depending on what kind of
mood I was in. </blockquote> <blockquote> As I moved into
middle and high school, I became more interested in reading
books that were considered more grown up and important.  I
read books that my English teachers recommended as good, or
other works by authors we had read in class that I enjoyed.
Senior year in high school I became very interested in
James Joyce after reading the short story "Araby" from
<i>Dubliners</i> and <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, and
read <i>Ulysses</i> as my independent project for my English
class.  Once I knew I enjoyed a particular author, I felt
compelled to read almost everything by him.  I tried hard
to read many of Joyce's works, struggling through most of
them and stopping just shy of <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.  I took a
class in Irish fiction here at school and was glad finally
to have the help I needed to fully appreciate many of his
stories I had earlier read for fun.  I was inspired by the
many Jane Austen movies that came out while I was in high
school to read most of her novels, especially enjoying
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.  I also loved Eudora Welty,
particularly the way her stories slowly develop characters
at the expense of the plot.  Welty novels are not full of
action, but instead offer intricately detailed descriptions
of emotions and feelings.  I'm not sure how I stumbled into
reading her works; I think I saw <i>Delta Wedding</i> at a
bookstore and thought the title sounded interesting.  A lot
of the books I read in high school were chosen that way
actually, by just seeing what looked appealing on the shelf
and judging whether it would be worth my time to read it or
not.</blockquote> <blockquote> Once I got to college,
reading for pleasure became something I did strictly on
break and during vacations, as there was more than enough to
read during the semester.  As in high school, I stuck mainly
with particular authors, working off recommendations from
friends and teachers.  The summer after second year I
devoured everything by Willa Cather, after a friend said
she loved <i>Death Comes for the Archbishop</i>; Cather's settings
and characters were just so different from everything else
I had encountered.  One of my friends told me that her TA
said <i>Middlemarch</i> was the best book he had ever read, so I
had to read that last summer.  I tried more of George Eliot
over this past winter break with <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>,
which I did not enjoy quite as much because the story was
so depressing.  Even still, I choose the books I read for
pleasure mostly based on the author, which can be limiting
in a sense because I generally gravitate towards the ones
that are considered "classic."  I want to try out different
genres, so I have right now a cultural history of Russia
that I am reading, because of my interest in Russian
history and politics.  I hope that I will continually be
exposed to different types of literature and authors, and
will choose to read not only what is considered "great,"
but also subjects that I am genuinely interested in.</blockquote>
