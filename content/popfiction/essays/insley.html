By Carla Insley</font></center><br>

<font size=+1>
<blockquote>I need to feel completely involved in the content of what I’m
reading in order to consider the experience pleasurable.  I can appreciate
and enjoy just about any kind of literature I come across in school, but I
seek out only true escapism when looking for a pleasure read.  The reason
behind this interest is simple – I need reading material to grab my
attention in order to give me the incentive to pick up anything at
all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My parents could never get me to sit down and read a book when I
was a kid.  It’s not that I was hyperactive or overly energetic, I just did
not see the point of taking the time to read something that wasn’t required
for school.  Scholastic reading programs with flashy incentives were created
for kids like me.  ‘Book It’, my personal favorite from elementary school,
rewarded progress with free Pizza Hut personal pan pizzas.  This program
took advantage of the given fact that kids will do just about anything for
pizza.  I never became a voracious reader, but I dappled in enough
Babysitter’s Club, fairy tale, Nancy Drew, and Little House on the Prairie
books to earn several trips to Pizza Hut.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My need for incentive dissipated only slightly as I grew up.  By
the time I entered high school, I had begun to recognize this limitation and
develop strategies to fix it.  I loved reading and knew how good it was for
me, I just had to learn how to make that feeling enough of an incentive.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>I discovered my motivation for reading in the idea of getting
away from my real life by entering familiar fictional worlds.  I wanted
escapism, but only from certain types of books.  I had no interest in
fantasy, science fiction, or detective stories.  As a teenage girl, my ideal
world was full of romance and attractive people.  I found myself drawn to
slightly racy romance novels, although I was careful to conceal my interests
by reading them only at night.  I was less self-conscious during my historic
romance stage, but I was always careful to keep my reading habits very
private.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even today, I hate reading in public.  I love to lie down,
recline, snuggle down, and generally relax within the privacy of my own home
or some other relatively concealed area.  During breaks between semesters, I
read in bed, traveling in airplanes, lying on the beach, curled up on the
couch, or back in the corner of some coffee shop.  I love the feeling of
being unobserved because it allows me to get unapologetically lost within a
fictional world.  I still have a soft spot for romantic fiction, although I’
ve lost interest in trashy novels.  (I get my fix for the slightly risqué
side of things by consuming month after month of Cosmopolitan
magazine.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The best example of the kind of enveloping fictional world that
I choose to enter is the Harry Potter series.  Like most of my book choices,
I based this selection on recommendations from friends and popular reviews.
As a fourth year UVA English major, it’s hard to admit that the best books I
’ve read recently are children’s books, but J. K. Rowling is an incredibly
entertaining author.  Her stories grab your attention from the beginning and
plunge you into the fantastic world of magic and intrigue.  My overall
favorite type of book could be described as having this kind of
attention-grabbing involvement with a more mature romantic twist.  Getting
lost in this kind of fictional world has become my own incentive for
reading.  Even so, a free personal pan pizza might still help make the
experience more pleasurable.</blockquote>
