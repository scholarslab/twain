<blockquote>Though I can't remember the first book I read I
do remember the one that my younger sister (six years my
junior) read first.  It was some version of <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>
and she was about two and a half or three.  Of course she
couldn't actually read at that time, but she had all the
words memorized to the book because she'd make my mom or
dad read it to her at least two times a day.  She would
hold it in her lap and recite the story verbatim, despite
the fact that the words she was saying usually did not
correspond to the page of text she had flipped to.  Reading
has always played a huge role in my life, mainly because my
parents would put a book in my hands at any moment during
my childhood instead of a computer game or the television
remote.  I have vivid recollections of my many trips to the
library where I'd max out my library card and the
librarians would stare at my mom and myself incredulously
as if we didn't fully grasp that all 30 books had to be
returned in two weeks.  In fifth grade my elementary school
had a competition for book reading, and that year I was the
winner with 638 books read.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It seems as though once I was forced to read
books for school that all reading for pleasure ceased.  I
don't know if that's because I just became too busy to do
any outside reading, but I think it may have been because I
subconsciously associated reading in general with a chore.
The only real reading for fun I did was during the summer
months, and I can remember going through a period where I
read Christopher Pike novels, then Stephen King, and then
Michael Crichton books.  So I suppose I've been a stickler
for the good old fashioned trashy horror books with no real
substance in them.  Kind of mindless I think, but I guess I
read them to escape the feeling that I need to analyze
something, since there's nothing really to analyze in books
like that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As of late, however, I've actually been reading
some legitimate books, mainly because my roommate is an
English major and she's been throwing some of her favorites
at me.  I try to read a little during the semester, and
though my goal of one book a semester that's purely
pleasure reading has not yet been fulfilled, I still read
two or three books during the breaks.  I actually think
I've lost my love for the fluff thrillers, as my attempt to
read Michael Crichton's newest book <i>Prey</i>  (which he
got paid $15 million for) ended in disappointment because
it was pretty hackneyed.  I think I like classically
acclaimed novels; I loved books like <i>Lolita</i>,
<i>David Copperfield</i>, and <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.  I also
do read some books on the best seller list if I've heard a
lot of good things about them, I'm a <i>Harry Potter</i>
fan, I do have to admit, and I've read <i>Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil</i> and <i>The Lovely Bones</i>.  I
think I try to pick the books I read carefully, since I
don't really have too much time to do extra reading, and it
irks me to waste my time on what I consider a bad book.  I
suppose I've found a good balance of trying books that are
generally considered "good" and a select few that have
recently won praise as best sellers.  I can't really
discern a trend in the genre I read, I find I enjoy a
classic love story as much as a mystery, and I think for me
a good book can fall under many categories and
classifications.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Being a Biology major as well as an English
major, I find the escape from the scientific world into the
literary one has helped me maintain my sanity on more than
one occasion.  I think what I gain from reading is that
instead of learning facts about why humans are alive for
chemical and biological reasons I am able to think of my
own spiritual and emotional existence in life.</blockquote>
