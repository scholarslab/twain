<b>A Fine Novel of the Civil War, by J. Donald Adams<br>

<center><b>From Various Critics</b></center>
<br>

<center>The East</center>

<p>WE HAVE had other novels about the Civil War by women, but I don't know of any other in which the interest
is so consistently centered, not upon the armies and the battles, the flags and the famous names, but upon that
other world of women who heard the storm, waited it out, succumbed to it or rebuilt after it, according to their
natures. . . . And it is that which gives GONE WITH THE WIND its originality and its individual impact. . . .
Miss Mitchell paints a broad canvas, and an exciting one.  And, in spite of its length, the book moves swiftly and
smoothly. . . . It is a solid and vividly interesting story of war and reconstruction, realistic in detail and
told from an original point of view. -- STEPHEN VICENT BENET in the <i>Saturday Review of Literature</i>.</p>

<p>The story told with such sincerity and passion, illuminating by such understanding, woven of the stuff of history
and of disciplined imagination, is endlessly interesting.  It is a dramatic recreation of life itself. -- HENRY STEELE
COMMAGER in the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>GONE WITH THE WIND is a remarkable performance. . . . An imaginative creation of quite unusual fascination. -- R. M.
GAY in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>.</p>
<br>

<center>The South</center>

<p>The people of Atlanta, and of Georgia, will most fully realize with what unerring skill the author has caught the
very atmosphere of the region, the very rhythm of a people's speech,
<center>[<font size=-1>PAGE 10</font>]</center>
the very accents of their thoughts. . . . GONE WITH THE WIND is a story of heroes and heroines, and very human men and women,
faultlessly told. -- SAMUEL TUPPER, JR. in the <i>Atlanta Journal</i>.</p>

<p>As rousing and exciting a story as has ever appeared within buckram. -- A. BERND in the <i>Macon Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p>It all knits up into one superb stirring vision of a great era in Southern history, nobly conceived and brought to
life in human terms.  We may indeed believe that GONE WITH THE WIND will take its place in the annals of English fiction
beside books like "Vanity Fair," whose general scheme and structure it resembles. -- JANE JUDGE in the <i>Savannah
News</i>.</p>
<br>
<center>The Middle West</center>

<p>No American canvas is richer, nor more thoroughly realized.  It is one of the great novels of our time. -- STERLING
NORTH in the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>.</p>

<p>Its characters are abundantly alive; it is full of dramatic episodes and startling crises.  Its historical background
is skillfully and vividly conceived. -- CLYDE BECK in the <i>Detroit News</i>.</p>
<br>

<center>The Far West</center>

<p>A book that is all story. . . . Like most simply written novels that carry their own utter sincerity for all to
see, this is one of those books that you will hate to finish. -- JOSEPH HENRY JACKSON in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>GONE WITH THE WIND is the most satisfactory, the most convincing, the most powerful presentation of that tragic period
that has ever been put into fiction. . . . The story is alive, dramatic, and packed with genuine feeling. -- PAUL JORDAN
SMITH in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.</p>

<center>A Talk with Margaret Mitchell About Her Novel and the Reasons for Its Popularity</center>
<center>By Herschel Brickell<br>
[from <i>The New York Post</i>, 7 August 1936]</center>

<p> . . . What makes a book so popular that everybody wishes to read it and, having read it, to tell everybody else about
it in a desire to share the excitement?</p>

<p>I have talked at length with Margaret Mitchell herself on the subject and I repeat here some of the things she told me
in the hope that they may go part way, at least, toward explaining why a historical novel of the Civil War should in this
year of a national election and a threatened European conflict occupy the leisure of thousands of Americans in every
part of the country.</p>

<p> . . . it proceeded from an irresistible inner compulsion . . . </p>

<center>[<font size=-1>PAGE 12</font>]</center>

<p>As for the style . . . chosen to write as clearly and as simply and as unobtrusively as possible. . . . She was careful,
she told me, to have her Negroes speak the dialect of the part of Georgia where the scenes of the book are laid.</p>


<center>[<font size=-1>PAGE 13</font>]</center>


<p>I asked her if she had any explanation of her own of the novel's widespread appeal, and she said she supposed it
was because the book dealt in primitive emotions which moved in straight lines, instead of the fantastic zigzags
of human and sexual relationships that clutter up so much of modern fiction. . . . The double appeal of the conflict
between Scarlett and Rhett Butler and the stirring background contain at least a part of the secret of the
popularity of the novel,
I think, although the perfection of the characterization is also inescapable.</p>

<center>[<font size=-1>PAGE 14</font>]</center>

<p>One of the heartening things about the book to me is that it tosses out of the window all the thousands of technical
tricks our novelists have been playing with for the past twenty years and goes straight back to honest story-telling
and to writing that anybody can understand.</p>
<p>I suspect it may have an important effect on the future course of American fiction in this regard, and I sincerely
hope it does.  I can see no competition to GONE WITH THE WIND for this year's Pulitzer Prize in fiction.</p>

<center>About the Author</center>
<br>
<center>[<font size=-1>PAGE 16</font>]</center>

<p>"I began the book in 1926, I think.  I was pretty tired of the 'realistic' fiction of the Jazz Age, so I thought
I'd write about the young days of the fine kind of people I knew who had survived war and Reconstruction.</p>
<p>"If the novel has a theme, the theme is that of survival. . . . We've seen it in the present depression.  It happens
in every upheaval.  Some people survive; others don't.  What qualities are in those who fight their way through
triumphantly that are lacking in those who go under?  What was it that made some of our Southern people able to come through a
war, a Reconstruction and a com-
<p17>
plete wrecking of all social and economic systems?  I don't know.  I only know that the survivors call that quality
'gumption.'  So I wrote about the people who had gumption and the people who didn't."</p>
