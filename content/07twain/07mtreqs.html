<font size=-1><b>ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION:</b></font> &nbsp; A seminar is like cooking a barrel of odds and ends together &mdash; according to Huck Finn, when you cook stuff that way "things get mixed up and the juice gets swapped around and things go better."  The first requirement for a good seminar is that we always show up, and come prepared to talk with each other about the day's reading.  I hope you'll all participate willingly.  And I will keep track of attendance.  Two unexcused absences are allowed.  Beyond that your grade will be affected.<br><br>

<font size=-1><b>LEADING A DISCUSSION:</b></font> &nbsp; Every student will lead the first 30-35 minutes of one class discussion during the term.  I bet by now you all have lots of ideas about what makes for good discussions, and what makes for bad ones.  It'll be your job to bring in good questions, but it'll be up to the group as a whole to come up with answers to them.  I'll put a sign-up sheet on my office door &mdash; you can sign up as soon as you want, and in any case by <font size=-1>WEDNESDAY</font>, <b>September 5</b>.<br><br>

<font size=-1><b>WRITTEN WORK:</b></font> &nbsp; You'll write three different kinds of assignments.<br><br>

 &nbsp; First, a short (600-800 words) review of a book about Mark Twain, due <b><font size=-1>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 5</b></font>.  You'll pick a book to read and review from this <b><font size=-1><a href="07biblio.html">CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY</a></font></b> &mdash; you have until <b><font size=-1>SEPTEMBER 14</b></font> to pick the one you want, but as soon as you've chosen, let me know so I can let the rest of the class know you've got dibs on it.  These reviews will be "published" and shared with the whole class.  On October 5, you'll e-mail me your review, marked up (or tagged) according to <b><font size=-1><a href="07revmodel.html">THIS MODEL</a></b></font>.  Once I get the electronic, tagged reviews, I'll post them to our webpage for everyone else to read.  We'll talk more about the details of this later....<br><br>

 &nbsp; Second, a short (400-word) close reading exercise.  Learning to see what's there is one of the major themes of MT's work.  To me that's also the most important skill you can learn in literature classes: how to look closely at texts for yourself, how to make meaning out of the specific details in a passage, how to develop ideas through your own analysis rather than someone else's generalizations.  For that reason (and to give you and me a chance to start a dialogue on your writing before you begin the long essay/project) I'm giving you the chance to pick a short (6-10 line) passage in <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, and interpret it.  We'll talk more about this later too. It will be due on <font size=-1>WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17</font>.<br><br> 

 &nbsp; Third, you'll do a final essay or project, due <b><font size=-1>FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7</b></font>.  We'll talk about this off and on throughout the semester.  If you choose to write a final essay, it should be 12-15 pages long.  Instead of an essay, you can also create a web-based project.  If you're interested in this alternative, let me know soon, and we can work together to define a good project and to make sure you have or get the training you'll need in HTML markup language, &c.  I'd love to be able to add more good student projects to the MT website, so I'll be happy to help anyone interested in trying this option.  I'm always happy to read good essays too, though, so you should decide which final project is most intellectually attractive to you.<br><br>

 &nbsp; In either case, you can focus the final project on whatever aspect of Mark Twain interests you most.  And in every case good final projects will be started early.  One way I'll help you to do that is by requiring everyone to submit a brief (one-page) prospectus for your project by <b><font size=-1>MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5</b></font>.<br><br>
