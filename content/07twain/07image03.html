 &nbsp; This is a detail from Chapter 18 of the first American edition of MT's <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, which has what the publisher called "Marginal Illustrations" on every page.  I've altered the original slightly, to make it fit our homepage better.  You can see the original, and the novel's hundreds of other illustrations, <font size=-1><a href="../wilson/facsimile/facsimilehp.html">HERE</a></font>.<br>
