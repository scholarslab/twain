<i>Mark Twain's Humor: The Image of a World</i>, Pascal Covici, Jr.<br>
(Dallas, Texas: Southern Methodist University Press, 1962)</font> <br><br>

     <p>Pascal Covici Jr.�s 1962 literary analysis of Mark Twain proves an unique interpretation of the ways in which the quintessential American author both capitalizes on and deviates from the traditional treatment of humor. Covici deconstructs the techniques Twain employs in his work in order to examine their effectiveness in rendering significance to a literature that is at large, comical. The analyst argues that while the author is renowned for his ability to make light of the world, he avoids the potential of undermining the seriousness of his content; in fact, the writer from Hannibal Missouri �is seriously concerned with problems of existence, [and] with what it means to live.� (249) Pascal�s overall composition exposes Twain�s exploitation of humor as a method through which he addresses personal ideologies regarding American culture and the human condition.</p>

<p>An especially poignant issue stressed by the book�s author is the complexity of Twain�s relationship with America. While one might argue that MT�s writing reflects his strong connection to his country, as his �use of humor is, at least partly, to put oneself in tune with early frontier and western humor,� Covici attempts to point out that the author was not a strict optimist when speaking of the United States. (3) In fact, the writer employed his literature as a means of communicating subjective aggravation with his immediate social atmosphere. The analyst claims that, �Twain [often] presents his impatience with America�s failings in terms of the problems confronting the artist who must deal with the country in fiction.� (130) This stands in disjunction with the stereotypical image of the novelist, yet it is certainly a valid allegation worth recognition, as it reminds the world �there clearly is more to Twain�s treatment of America than simpleminded adulation.� (35)</p>

<p>Pascal goes on further to suggest that the humor of the nineteenth century author surrounding America is dense and frequently lacks the straightforwardness that a na�ve reader might expect. The MT�s texts actually reflect a certain degree of unease with regard to marrying a specific platform: political, social, or economic. Covici maintains, �Twain himself had difficulty defining his position, and the unevenness of his sympathies often mars his books.� (92) While this may manifest some point of truth, the statement is a harsh criticism of MT, and perhaps a more appropriate contention is that the author tends to present a complex representation of reality. �Twain uses the materials of realism�the events and objects of the daily life of the region,� in order to render a convincing portrait of the world. (13) The novelist then avoids pin pointing a specific over-riding moral to his work intentionally, mirroring his propensity, �to leave the reader �up in the air�.� (150) Thus, while Twain certainly addresses serious concerns for contemporary American culture, his position on many matters remains ambiguous, leaving the reader to acknowledge the presence of controversy and establish personal solutions.</p>

<p>Twain further uses this notion of presenting convoluted versions of the truth�hoaxes is the word the analyst uses�throughout the course of his literary career as an instrument for his humor. One of Covici�s strongest emphases is how �a major source of [MT�s] humor is the sudden revelation of a discrepancy between appearance and reality.� (180) Pascal claims that the author applies a typical technique of humorists, which highlights the incongruity between actual events and the interpretation of such by both characters and audience members. That is to say, �that Twain�s American laughs, does not mean, always, that he is happily at ease in the world.� (31) Ultimately the hoax is used to jolt the reader, adding entertainment to some form of revelation. Furthermore, the novelist extends the notion of false impressions to the appearances of many of his characters. Twain �presents human beings as more disposed to misunderstand themselves, [�] than to mislead others deliberately.� (19) He presents the human condition as intrinsically flawed, and his sympathies are often expressed through the characterization of his literary figures. Covici suggests that Twain believes, �man is not deliberately corrupt himself�he cannot help himself.� (218)</p>

     <p>Pascal Covici�s literary analysis claims Mark Twain�s writing throughout the nineteenth century has been missed-attributed as a series of simple works of comedic fiction. Instead, the analyst suggests that the genius of Twain lies in the novelist�s ability to present his concerns with human existence and American society in a palatable manner through the manipulation of rhetoric. Mark Twain� humor is �especially important [to the author] when it serves to reveal hidden truth about the reader himself.� (160) The renowned writer uses his talents to incorporate issues of American culture, as well as images of the human condition between the lines of his pages. �The realist, the social critic, and the visionary become fused in the woven texture of Twain�s work,� and for this reason, his humor will remain at the heart of American literature for years to come.
