          <p>The American Publishing company of this city have just
          issued Mark Twain's book, "Tom Sawyer." It is a beautiful
          book, both outside and in, as one might naturally expect
          to find it on seeing the imprint of this publishing house
          upon it--a house that has established a well-earned
          reputation in the book publishing lines. The
          illustrations in the book are of a merit beyond praise.
          They are of the eloquent kind that speak for themselves,
          as well as for the print they illustrate. Those who
          imagine this to be a tame story for little boys will
          discover their mistake on reading it. It is safe to
          predict that no one will read the first page without
          reading all the rest. There is a power of attraction
          about it that doesn't "let up," but grows stronger to the
          end. Though claiming to be a book for boys and girls it
          will not be monopolized by them. There's rich
          entertainment in it for both young and old. The author
          says most of the adventures recorded in it really
          occurred, and that one or two of them were his own.
          Perhaps his well-known modesty forbids his claiming any
          larger proportion. The story dates back some forty years
          ago, in one of the southwestern slave states. The hero,
          Tom Sawyer, is a unique individual, to state it mildly.
          The author says he belongs to the composite order of
          architecture. Perhaps that is as good a description of
          him as can be given in brief. He isn't one of the
          orthodox boys who love their Sunday schools, and love to
          read about the good little boys who die early and go to
          heaven. He evidently preferred the other place where they
          don't have any Sunday schools, and the boys don't have to
          keep quiet every seventh day in the week. He doesn't
          believe in early deaths, nor early piety. Tom is a
          reckless, daredevil fellow, ready to hazard life for an
          adventure any time; but under the rollicking air of the
          book there appears an occasional bit of philosophy in the
          peculiarly dry, sarcastic vein of the author, as this,
          for <a name="3">instance</a>:</p>

            If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the
            writer of this book, he would now have comprehended
            that Work consists of whatever a body is <i>obliged</i>
            to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not
            obliged to do. And this would help him to understand
            why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a
            tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
            Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy
            gentlemen in England who drive four-horse
            passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily
            line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them
            considerable money; but if they were offered wages for
            the service, that would turn it into work and then they
            would resign.

            After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague
            turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off
            "notices" of meetings and societies and things till it
            seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
            doom -- a queer custom which is still kept up in
            America, even in cities, away here in this age of
            abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to
            justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get
            rid of it.<br />
            &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And now the minister prayed. A good,
            generous prayer it was, and went into details: it
            pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
            church; for the other churches of the village; for the
            village itself; for the county; for the State; for the
            State officers; for the United States; for the churches
            of the United States; for Congress; for the President;
            for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors,
            tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions
            groaning under the heel of European monarchies and
            Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the
            good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to
            hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the
            sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he
            was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be
            as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
            grateful harvest of good. Amen.

          <p>The following, especially the account of the fly's
          toilet is particularly <a name="5">good</a>:</p>

            The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy
            the prayer, he only endured it -- if he even did that
            much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of
            the details of the prayer, unconsciously -- for he was
            not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the
            clergyman's regular route over it -- and when a little
            trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected
            it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
            additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the
            prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of
            him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands
            together, embracing its head with its arms, and
            polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost
            part company with the body, and the slender thread of a
            neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its
            hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had
            been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as
            tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As
            indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to
            grab for it they did not dare -- he believed his soul
            would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing
            while the prayer was going on. But with the closing
            sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and
            the instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner
            of war.
          </blockquote>

          <p>During the sermon that followed--a sermon that thinned
          the elect down to a company so small as to be "hardly
          worth the saving"--Tom had further interesting adventures
          which helped to give variety and keep awake "other people
          uninterested in the sermon" as well as himself.</p>

          <p>The account, some chapters further along, of the
          village school graduating exercises, and the prize poems
          and compositions of the young ladies, is racy and rich,
          but not in the least exaggerated. Its beauty consists in
          its truth to life. The slim, melancholy girl, with a cast
          of countenance "that comes of pills and indigestion," who
          reads a poem as indigestible as her ordinary diet, is to
          be found in any average school of the present day, as can
          likewise be found her bilious companion who reads a
          composition which "wound up with a sermon so destructive
          of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first
          prize."</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most pointed paragraph in the book is the
          following in relation to a petition for pardon for a
          <a name="6">murderer</a>:</p>

            The petition had been largely signed; many tearful and
            eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of
            sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and
            wail around the governor, and implore him to be a
            merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe
            was believed to have killed five citizens of the
            village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself
            there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to
            scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and drip a
            tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky
            water-works.

          <p>If there is any defect in the book it is in the love
          scenes, where a boy of Tom Sawyer's size wanders off to
          be an outlaw. This part is a little overdrawn. But the
          whole story is so exquisitely told that the book will be
          widely sought. It is a capital gift for the holidays.</p>
