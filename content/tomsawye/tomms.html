        <p>The manuscript of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> that MT sent his
        friend Howells was a copy made by a secretary. It is now in
        The Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site, in
        Stoutsville, Missouri. John Josef Huffman, the Historic
        Site Administrator, generously made the two photographs
        reproduced here, which show a couple of the most
        interesting of the places where Howells suggested revisions
        in the margins. At left is the passage in Chapter Five
        describing the way Tom, a pinch-bug and a vagrant poodle
        dog disrupt the church service. As you can see by looking
        at the canceled line, MT had originally written that the
        dog "went sailing up the aisle, <i>with his tail shut down
        like a hasp</i>." The pencilled comment in the left margin
        is by Howells, and reads: "awfully good but a little too
        dirty." After getting the MS back from Howells, MT then
        cancelled the italicized words.</p>

        <p>The other MS passage is from Chapter Twenty. It depicts
        Becky's discovery of the picture of "a human figure, stark
        naked," in the teacher's anatomy text. In the margin
        Howells wrote "I should be afraid of this picture
        incident." MT's responded, in this MS, by cancelling the
        words "stark naked" -- although he did not finally leave
        them out of the book -- and by making a series of revisions
        in his depiction of this incident, including leaving out
        entirely Tom's reflections on the event: "But that picture
        is -- is -- well, now it ain't so curious she feels bad
        about that. No . . . . . . No, I reckon it ain't. Suppose
        she was Mary, and Alf Temple caught her looking at such a
        picture as that, and went around telling. She'd feel mighty
        bad. She'd feel -- well, I'd <i>lick</i> him. I bet I
        would."</p>
