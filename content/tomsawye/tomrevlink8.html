  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 4</h3>

  <p>Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official
  bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,
  discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find
  a target. The librarian "showed off" -- running hither and
  thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the
  splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in.</p>

  <tt>Page 54</tt><br />
  The young lady teachers "showed off" -- bending sweetly over
  pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning
  fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The
  young gentlemen teachers "showed off" with small scoldings and
  other little displays of authority and fine attention to
  discipline -- and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found
  business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business
  that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
  (with much seeming vexation). The little girls "showed off" in
  various ways, and the little boys "showed off" with such
  diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur
  of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a
  majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in
  the sun of his own grandeur -- for he was "showing off," too.
