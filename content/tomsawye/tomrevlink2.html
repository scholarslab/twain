  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 5</h3>

  <p>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a
  relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part
  of the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed
  steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with
  strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if
  from a spring-board:<br />
  <tt>Page 60</tt><br />
  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry beds of ease,
  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' blood-y
  seas?</p>

  <p>He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church "sociables"
  he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was
  through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall
  helplessly in their laps, and "wall" their eyes, and shake their
  heads, as much as to say, "Words cannot express it; it is too
  beautiful, too beautiful for this mortal earth."</p>

  <p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned
  himself into a bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings
  and societies and things till it seemed that the list would
  stretch out to the crack of doom -- a queer custom which is still
  kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of
  abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a
  traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.</p>

  <p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was,
  and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little
  children of the church; for the other churches of the village;
  for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the
  State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the
  United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers
  of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for
  the oppressed millions<br />
  <tt>Page 61</tt><br />
  groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental
  despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and
  yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen
  in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication
  that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor,
  and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
  grateful harvest of good. Amen.</p>

  <p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation
  sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy
  the prayer, he only endured it -- if he even did that much. He
  was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the
  prayer, unconsciously -- for he was not listening, but he knew
  the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it --
  and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear
  detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
  additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a
  fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured
  his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its
  head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed
  to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a
  neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs
  and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails;
  going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was
  perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's
  hands<br />
  <tt>Page 62</tt><br />
  itched to grab for it they did not dare -- he believed his soul
  would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the
  prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began
  to curve and steal forward; and the instant the "Amen" was out
  the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made
  him let it go.</p>

  <p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously
  through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by
  began to nod -- and yet it was an argument that dealt in
  limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect
  down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom
  counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how
  many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about
  the discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a
  little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
  assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when
  the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child
  should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the
  great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
  conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking
  nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself
  that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.</p>

  <p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was
  resumed. Presently he bethought<br />
  <tt>Page 63</tt><br />
  him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black
  beetle with formidable jaws -- a "pinchbug," he called it. It was
  in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
  take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle
  went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt
  finger went into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working
  its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed
  for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people
  uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they
  eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along,
  sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary
  of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
  drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked
  around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it
  again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip
  and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another,
  and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his
  stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his
  experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and
  absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
  descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp
  yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple
  of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring
  spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went
  behind<br />
  <tt>Page 64</tt><br />
  fans and handkerchiefs, and Tomwas entirely happy. The dog looked
  foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his
  heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle
  and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every
  point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of
  the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth,
  and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew
  tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly
  but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close
  to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot
  the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild
  yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps
  continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of
  the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the
  doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his
  progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its
  orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic
  sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master's
  lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress
  quickly thinned away and died in the distance.</p>

  <p>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating
  with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead
  standstill. The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame
  and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end;
  for even<br />
  <tt>Page 65</tt><br />
  the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a
  smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote
  pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious
  thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the
  ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.</p>

  <p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that
  there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a
  bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was
  willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did
  not think it was upright in him to carry it off.<br />
