          <p>Our city of Hartford can boast the greatest humorist
          in current literature. Mr. Clemens owes nothing to
          erratic spelling like "Artemas Ward," or to exciting
          political themes like some other witty writers. He is
          altogether original and unique. "The Innocents Abroad,"
          is an exhaustless feast vastly entertaining and full of
          information as a book of travels. The same charm of
          genius in an unusual direction fills the fascinating
          pages of "Tom Sawyer." The boy hero and the other
          children are so lifelike that the reader hardly needs the
          author's assurance that real boys and genuine parts are
          in the book. One gets very fond of Tom notwithstanding
          his grave faults, some of which you almost wish had been
          omitted. But he is a brave, manly boy after all, and the
          finest scene in the whole story to one reader at least,
          is where he receives a whipping to shield a little,
          terrified girl. The childish attachment between these two
          and the manly protection Tom accords to little Becky both
          at school and amid the horrors of being lost in the cave,
          are very finely described. To one who had only seen the
          other side of Tom's character these noble traits would
          have seemed impossible. The "pain-killer" adventure is
          funny beyond expression as is much of Tom's career. The
          last few chapters are extremely sensational and strike
          one as too remarkable to be natural adventures for little
          boys. One cannot help regretting that so fine a fellow as
          Tom lies and smokes, but the intention was not to
          describe a model boy. Yet these traits solely detract
          from the hero. Those who regard Mark Twain as only "a
          funny man," greatly underestimate his power. Wit is the
          spice of his books not the substance. In this story are
          some most exquisitely beautiful descriptions. That of
          early morning in one place particularly, is delicious in
          its perfect picture of nature and its beautiful
          poetry.</p>
