  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 5</h3>

  <p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned
  himself into a bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings
  and societies and things till it seemed that the list would
  stretch out to the crack of doom -- a queer custom which is still
  kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of
  abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a
  traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.</p>

  <p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was,
  and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little
  children of the church; for the other churches of the village;
  for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the
  State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the
  United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers
  of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for
  the oppressed millions</p>

  groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental
  despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and
  yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen
  in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication
  that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor,
  and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
  grateful harvest of good. Amen.
