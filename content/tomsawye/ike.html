    <font size="+1"><b>HOW IKE DROPPED THE CAT.</b></font>
  </center><br />

  <p>"Now, Isaac," said Mrs. Partington, as she came into the room
  with a basket snugly covered over, "take our Tabby, and drop her
  somewhere, and see that she don't come back again, for I am sick
  and tired of driving her out of the butter. She is the thievinest
  creatur! But don't hurt her, Isaac; only take care that she don't
  come back."</p>

  <p>Ike smiled as he received his charge, and the old lady felt
  happy in getting rid of her trouble without resorting to
  violence. She would rather have endured the evil of the cat,
  great as that evil was, than that the poor quadruped should be
  inhumanly dealt with. She saw Ike depart, in the dusk of the
  evening, and watched him until he became lost to view in the
  shadow of a tree. It was a full half hour before he returned with
  his empty basket, and an unusual glee marked his appearance, --
  it sparkled in his eye, it glowed in his cheek, it sported in his
  hair, -- and Ike looked really handsome, as he stood before the
  dame, and proclaimed the success of his mission.</p>

  <p>"Did she drop easy, Isaac?" asked the old lady, looking upon
  him kindly, "and won't she comeback?"</p>

  <p>"She dropt just as easy!" said Ike, letting his basket fall on
  the floor, and shying his cap upon the table, somewhat
  endangering a glass lamp with a wooden bottom that stood thereon;
  "she dropt just as easy! and she won't come back -- you may bet
  high on that."</p>

  <p>"But you didn't beat and mangle her, Isaac, did you? If you
  did I should be afraid she would come back and haunt us -- I have
  heard of such things"; and she looked anxiously in his face; but,
  detecting there no trace of guilt, she patted him on the head,
  and parted his hair, and told him to sit down and eat his supper,
  which the young gentleman did with considerable unction.</p>

  <p>"Isaac! Isaac!" screamed Mrs. Partington, at the foot of the
  little stairway that led to the attic where the boy slept, the
  next morning after the above occurrence. "Isaac!" -- and he came
  down stairs slowly, rubbing his eyes as he came. She had
  disturbed his morning nap.</p>

  <p>"Isaac," said she, "what is that hanging yonder to a limb of
  our apple-tree?" One scattering tree, as she said, constituted
  her whole orchard, unless she counted the poplar by the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"I can't see so fur off," said Ike, still rubbing his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should think it was a cat; and it looks to me like
  our Tabby. O, Isaac! if you have done this!" and a tone akin to
  horror trembled in her voice.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and see if it's her," said Ike, as if not hearing the
  last part of her remark; and he dashed out of the door, but soon
  came back, with wonder depicted on every feature of his
  expressive countenance. "O, it's her! sure enough, it's her!"
  cried he, "but I <i>did</i> drop her!"</p>

  <p>"Well, how could she come there then?" and the good old lady
  looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you how I guess it was," said Ike, looking demurely
  up. "I guess that she committed suicide, because we was going to
  drop her; they are dreadful knowing critters, you know."</p>

  <p>"True enough," replied the old lady, while something like a
  tear glistened in her eye -- her pity was excited; "true enough,
  Isaac, and I dare say she thought hard of us for doing it; but
  she had n't ought to if she'd have considered a minute."</p>

  <p>Ike said no more, but went out and cut down the supposed
  suicide, with a serious manner, and buried her beneath her
  gallows, deep down among the roots of the old tree, and she never
  came back.</p>

  <p>The old lady told the story to the minister, and Ike vouched
  for it, but the good man shook his head incredulously at the idea
  of the suicide, and looked at the boy. He very evidently
  understood how the cat was <i>dropped</i>.</p><br />

    <font size="+1"><b>MORAL TRAINING.</b></font>
  </center><br />

  <p>"MORAL training," said Mrs. Partington, "is the best, arter
  all." She had heard some one in the omnibus speaking of moral
  training, and her benevolence gave it into the charge of memory
  until she got home, and memory revolved it, and pondered it, and
  reviewed it, and fancy construed it to mean something about the
  military training that was to come off the next day.</p>

  <p>"I hope it will be a moral training, I'm shore," said she;
  "for I see tho Gov'nor is to be there in his new suit, and I hope
  they'll make their revolutions well before him. I do admire the
  millintery, where the sogers in their fancy unicorns look jest
  like a patchwork quilt. They was n't moral trainings in old
  times, when men put 'enemies into their heads to steal away their
  hats,' as Mr. Smooth, the schoolmaster, used to say. Your Uncle
  Paul had a good deal of millintery sperrit sometimes, Isaac."</p>

  <p>Ike had remained very quiet while she was speaking.</p>

  <p>"What upon airth are you doing there, Isaac?" cried she.</p>

  <p>The young gentleman readily told her he was painting a horse,
  at the same time displaying an animal, nominally of that
  description, done beautifully in blue, which he appeared to look
  on with much satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"But what are you painting it with? As true as I'm alive
  you've got your Uncle Paul's tompion that he used to wear in his
  cap so long ago, and you're using up all my bluing!"</p>

  <p>That pompon, saved for so many years, to be used for such a
  purpose! Ah, Ike, Ike! we fear the old lady will have sad times
  with thee yet. Why didst thou, yester even, secrete the large
  ball of yarn for thine own purposes, which to-morrow she will
  seek for in vain? Say, why?</p>
