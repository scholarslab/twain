        <p>The central source for MT's first novel is obviously the
        childhood of Sam Clemens. But both Tom Sawyer the boy and
        <i>Tom Sawyer</i> the book are imaginatively dependent on
        texts. It is chiefly from books -- about Robin Hood,
        pirates, robbers -- that Tom gets his ideas about what and
        how to play. Tom is a very literal-minded reader, who goes
        devoutly by the book. As long, that is, as the book is not
        the Bible, but a romance of some kind. MT, on the other
        hand, is a realist re-writer. Although he accepted Howells'
        argument that <i>Tom</i> should be marketed as a "boys'
        book," and although generations of kids have enjoyed it as
        one, he wrote it more as a genial burlesque or parody of
        contemporary children's fiction.</p>

        <p>The other texts in this section have been chosen to
        contextualize that project. Two are earlier satires by MT
        himself on conventional stories about boys -- his "Bad
        Little Boy Who Did Not Come to Grief" (1865) and his "Good
        Little Boy Who Did Not Prosper" (1870). In them he refers
        explicitly to Sunday-School stories. I haven't included any
        examples from that genre, but both Alger's <i>Ragged
        Dick</i> (1868) and Louisa May Alcott's <i>Little Women</i>
        (1868) are didactic enough to suggest the sort of story MT
        was trying to re-write, in them and in <i>Tom</i>. The
        March girls go by the book, too -- but their book is
        Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>.</p>

        <p>The other two selections here are from books that have
        often been suggested as sources for <i>Tom</i>. American
        readers first met Mrs. Partington's nephew Ike in the late
        1840s. Aldrich's <i>Bad Boy</i>, also named Tom, made his
        debut in 1869.</p>
