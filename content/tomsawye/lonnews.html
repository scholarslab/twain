          <p>"Mark Twain" has dropped the humorous exaggerations of
          his "Jumping Frog" and "Innocents Abroad" in his fresh
          and racy story of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> (Chatto and Windus).
          "Although," writes this popular American humorist in his
          preface, "my book is intended mainly for the
          entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be
          shunned by men and women on that account; for part of my
          plan has been to try to write pleasantly, to remind
          adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they
          felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises
          they sometimes engaged in." So very human is "Tom Sawyer"
          in its faithful delineation of boy-life that it cannot
          fail to realize the hope of "Mark Twain," and amuse
          everyone who in the words of the song, "would" he "were a
          boy again." All the love of mischief, hopes and fears,
          joys and sorrows, foolhardy pranks and acts of bravery
          that make Tom Sawyer stand out as a veritable portrait
          from the life are set down by Mr. Clemens with unfailing
          fidelity to nature; and that element of adventure so dear
          to boys is supplied in a manner to satisfy the appetite
          for the strangest sensational fare. It is the faithful
          portrayal of boy-life, however--not the midnight murder
          in a churchyard of which Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are
          eye-witnesses, nor the piratical venture of Tom and his
          mates, nor even the wanderings of Tom and his sweetheart
          whilst lost in the cave--that makes "Mark Twain's" last
          volume so welcome, and that will, doubtless, win for him
          even a wider circle of readers that he has at
          present.</p>
