        <p>After reading the novel in manuscript, William Dean
        Howells suggested to MT that he could "deliberately
        advertise it by Atlantic publication" before bringing it
        out as a book. MT replied that he could not afford to sell
        the story to the <i>Atlantic</i> for what the magazine
        Howells edited would be able to pay, but he did not
        hesitate to ask his friend to review the book in the
        <i>Atlantic</i> as part of the sales campaign; Howells
        himself thought of the review he wrote at least in part as
        designed "to start the sheep jumping in the right places"
        (see <a href="hompgrev.html">Reviews)</a>.</p>

        <p>Moncure Conway, whom MT had commissioned as his agent to
        secure the novel's publication in England, reviewed the
        British edition in the London <i>Examiner</i> the day the
        book appeared there (see <a href=
        "hompgrev.html">Reviews).</a> Conway was also a foreign
        correspondent for the <i>Cincinnati Commercial</i>. In his
        "London Letter" published in the <i>Commercial</i> on 26
        June 1876 he wrote a long notice of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> that
        repeated many of the things he said in the <i>Examiner</i>
        review, but also included five long excerpts from the
        story. Many American papers reprinted part or all of
        Conway's "Letter." The excerpted passages from <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i> -- the introduction of Huck, Injun Joe's Cup,
        the satire on sentimental eloquence, the pinchbug in
        church, and, at greatest length, the whitewashing scene --
        were reprinted in such papers as the Philadelphia <i>Sunday
        Republic</i>, the New York <i>Evening Post</i>, the Boston
        <i>Transcript</i>, the Portland <i>Transcript</i>, the
        Springfield <i>Republican</i> and the San Francisco
        <i>Call</i>. Conway's entire "Letter," including the
        quotations, was reprinted in such papers as the St. Louis
        <i>Globe Democrat</i>, the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> and the
        <i>Hartford Times</i>. Because the passages Conway chose
        were so widely reprinted, his letter functioned almost as a
        pre-publication preview of the novel. Because the American
        edition did not appear until almost half a year later, his
        comments on the novel and selections from it were for a
        long time the only way most Americans "knew" <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i>.<br />

        <p><a name="1">Bliss</a> prepared his own account of the
        novel for the prospectus, where he also printed severely
        edited passages from four favorable reviews, including
        Howells'. As you can see, although MT apparently accepted
        Howells' suggestion about treating <i>Tom Sawyer</i> as a
        "boys' book," Bliss promoted it instead as a book for adult
        readers.<br />

        <p>According to Hamlin Hill, sometime after the publication
        of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, when subscription sales had stalled,
        Bliss arranged a circular and sent it to prospective
        mail-order customers. There is no copy of this circular in
        the Barrett Collection, but Hill says it was a single
        sheet, double-sided, with the novel's first page on the
        front and his own "advertisement" for the novel on the
        back, so it is possible to get a sense of how the circular
        looked:<br /></p>

        <p>If promoting the book this way improved sales at all,
        the process was a slow one. As mentioned in the section on
        <a href="tomcomp.html">Composition, Revision and
        Piracy,</a> sales of the authorized edition of <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i> started growing when <i>Huck Finn</i> was
        published in 1885 -- presumably because of Tom's appearance
        in the novel, and also because all the ads for <i>Huck</i>
 prominently mentioned Tom.</p>
