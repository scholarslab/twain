    <h2>Getting <i>Tom</i> to Market</h2>

        <p>Mark Twain wrote his story about Tom at three different
        times: the winter of 1872-73; the spring and summer, 1874;
        the spring and summer, 1875. He may have set out initially
        either to burlesque conventional children's books, or to
        trace Tom's progress all the way into adulthood. Vestiges
        of his parodic intention remain, but as he wrote it the
        book became an idyll of childhood -- or as MT called it, a
        "hymn" -- set during one glorious if implausible summer of
        adventure.</p><a href="tomms.html"><img src="tomms1.gif"
        align="right" border="0" hspace="8" alt ="DETAIL: MS OF TOM SAWYER" /></a>

        <p>Even after he'd finished it, MT felt strongly that
        <i>Tom Sawyer</i> was "<i>not</i> a boy's book." It was
        William Dean Howells who convinced him "to treat it
        explicitly <i>as</i> a boy's story," and sell it on that
        basis. Howells read a copy of the manuscript in November,
        1875. MT "thoroughly &amp; painstakingly" revised his
        manuscript before sending it to Howells, but wanted his
        friend to check the text for lapses of taste and decorum.
        Howells was enthusiastic about the story, but in the
        margins did suggest a number of changes, some to improve
        its art and some to refine its manners.</p>

          HOWELLS' COMMENTS</b></font></a>
        </center><br />
        <br />

        <p>When he went through the manuscript one last time, MT
        accepted most of Howells' emendations, and changed one
        additional word Howells had apparently overlooked: having
        Huck say "thunder" instead of "hell."</p>

        <p>When the revised copy went to the typesetters in
        January, 1876, MT had great hopes for this "experiment."
        The first American edition of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, however,
        did not appear until almost a year later. The delay cost MT
        over $10,000, according to his own reckoning, and
        contributed to the book's weak first-year sales.</p>

        <p>The reasons for the delay remain unclear. MT did not
        want an American edition published until the novel had
        first appeared in England, thus securing a British
        copyright. The English <i>Tom Sawyer</i> came out on 9 June
        1876, but Elisha Bliss was unprepared to launch a sales
        campaign -- perhaps, as MT complained, because the American
        Publishing Co. was pushing too many other books, perhaps
        because Bliss was unenthusiastic about <i>Tom</i>. As a
        short work of fiction it was an anomalous subscription
        book. <i>The Gilded Age</i> (1873) was the first time a
        novel had ever been sold "by subscription only," and it
        hadn't done as well as MT's previous travel books. <a href=
        "../marketin/facts2.html#a">According to one book
        agent</a>, a woman in California, it was embarrassing to
        offer subscribers a book as thin as <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.</p>

        <p>Despite angry proddings from MT, the selling of <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i> kept being put off. By the time the prospectus
        and agents were in the field, a pirated edition of the
        novel had been on the market for four months.</p><a href=

        align="left" border="0" hspace="8" alt ="DETAIL: CANADIAN EDITION OF TOM SAWYER" /></a><br />

        <p>Tom Sawyer always wanted to be a pirate, but MT was
        furious about being pirated. The unauthorized <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i> came from Canada , where the copyright situation
        was vague enough to encourage widespread reprintings of
        MT's works during the 1870s. An unillustrated <i>Adventures
        of Tom Sawyer</i> was published by the Belford Brothers on
        29 July 1876.</p>

        <center>
          <a href="javascript:Start('ts1876cv.html')"><font size=
          "-1"><b>COVER OF CANADIAN EDITION</b></font></a>

        <br clear="left" />
        <br />
        <a href="javascript:Start3('ts1876tp.html')"><img src=
        "ts1876tp.gif" align="right" border="0" alt ="DETAIL: TITLE PAGE OF CANADIAN EDITION" /></a>

        <p>MT suspected that the Belfords had stolen proof sheets
        of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> from Bliss' factory, but it is more
        likely that they set their edition from a hastily imported
        copy of the British one. Their version of the novel was
        available in three prices: $.75, $1.00 or $2.25 --
        considerably less than the authorized one would cost. And
        there was no way to keep pirated copies of the book from
        coming into America along steamboat and train lines.
        Howells, for example, saw a Canadian <i>Tom Sawyer</i> for
        sale in the Albany train station. The copy in the Barrett
        Collection graphically indicates what MT was up against on
        its titlepage, where someone (the name has been effaced)
        recorded where and when the book was bought: on the steamer
        <i>St. Lawrence</i>, perhaps on its way into America, and
        in September, 1876 -- fully three months before Bliss was
        ready to sell any copies on which MT could make money.</p>

        <p>The Belfords' illegal <i>Tom</i> was so popular that
        third printing was needed by October, 1876. And when, in
        1879, the firm -- now known as the Rose-Belford Publishing
        Co. -- decided to introduce a line of novels in a new
        newspaper format that could be sold for ten or twenty cents
        and sent through the mails at reduced rates, the first text
        they printed was <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, illustrated with
        woodcuts that seem to be imitated from True Williams'
        pictures. American readers could order and receive
        <i>Tom</i> in this inexpensive format through the
        mails.</p>

        <center>
          <a href="javascript:Start2('tsrose1.html')"><font size=
          "-1"><b>TWENTY-CENT TOM SAWYER</b></font></a>
        </center><br />
        <br />

        <p>MT raged against the Belfords, too, and later tried
        various strategies for securing Canadian rights that would
        foil their piracies. But mainly he blamed Bliss for the
        delay that meant that by the time the first American
        edition of his first novel appeared, it was for many people
        an old story.</p><img src="huckad1.jpg" align="right"
        border="0" hspace="8" alt ="AD: AGENTS WANTED FOR HUCK FINN" />

        <p>Neither how many Canadian copies were sold in the States
        nor exactly how much money MT lost to the pirates is known.
        But the fate of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> not only soured him on
        the American Publishing Co; it also seems to have
        discouraged him as a writer. During the next five years he
        published only one book.</p>

        <p>MT's royalties from <i>Tom Sawyer</i> picked up
        considerably after 1885, when <i>Adventures of Huckleberry
        Finn</i> appeared with the subtitle <i>Tom Sawyer's
        Comrade</i>. Tom's name was conspicuous in <a href=
        "javascript:Start4('hfinnad1.html')">
        the advertising for Huck's book</a>, and the popularity of
        MT's second novel about the world he grew up in renewed the
        public's appetite for his first.</p>
