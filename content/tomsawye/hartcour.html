          <p>Mark Twain's <i>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> was
          published in England last June, and immediately many of
          the most easily detached and quotable portions of it
          found their way into the American press, and a wide
          circulation. The COURANT printed at the time two or three
          extracts from the book--Tom's adventure with the beetle
          in church, a most delightful study as well as a piece of
          profound philosophy, and the whitewashing of the fence, a
          bit of genuine fun with an artistic finish that would
          give the author a deserved reputation if he had never
          written anything else. The volume has just been brought
          out here in a very handsome style, copiously illustrated
          with drawings by Mr. J. W. Williams, who has happily
          entered into the spirit of the book, and produced
          excellent and on the whole the best set of character
          sketches we have ever seen from his pencil. The
          engravings do not all do justice to the original
          drawings, but they are more than fair, and as the text is
          beautifully printed on broad pages, the whole effect is
          very pleasing, and the volume is attractive at the first
          glance.</p>

          <p><i>Tom Sawyer</i> is in some respects an advance on
          anything that Mr. Clemens has before done--an advance we
          mean as a piece of literary work, careful in finish, and
          thought out more maturely. It has not the large, original
          force of the uncontrollable, spontaneous humor that in
          "The Innocents Abroad" carried an irrepressible burst of
          merriment round the globe, from San Francisco to India by
          way of Europe, but it has passages as exquisitely
          humorous as any in that book, and as a general thing it
          is more finely wrought. The passages we have spoken of
          above amply sustain this assertion; you can read them
          again and again with new delight, and indeed, we find it
          difficult not to read them every time we take up the
          book. They could not have been written without the spark
          of genius. We find in this book, too, the author's style,
          not more virile and sparklingly clear than formerly, but
          more carefully finished; and the author has toned down a
          little those excursions into the impossible, which are
          intensely amusing, but do not commend themselves to the
          judgment on a second reading. And in doing this he has
          lost nothing of his extraordinarily forceful use of the
          English language. There is no one writing today who has a
          finer intuitive sense of the right word in the right
          place.</p>

          <p>The book is all about boys, and it is said to be
          written for boys. It is a masterly reproduction of boy's
          life and feeling, but, at the same time, it is written
          above boys: that is, the best part of it--the wit, the
          humor, the genius of it will fly miles above every boy's
          head in the country. The boys can appreciate the
          adventure in it as a mere narrative, but not that which
          makes the adventure valuable to older readers, who recall
          their own boyhood in it. The boy has not the least sense
          of humor; that is nothing funny to him in having his
          pocket in measure of useless trash; the tricks he plays
          upon his comrades are not amusing to him; he is a
          non-humorous, dead, in earnest creature, and it is this
          characteristic that makes him amusing to us (to himself
          in retrospect); but his serious life does not take in
          what we call humor. It is for this reason that we say
          that Tom Sawyer will be enjoyed most by mature readers,
          who will have a great delight in seeing how faithfully
          boy life is recalled.</p>

          <p>Boy nature is the same everywhere, and the
          characteristics here given are of universal acceptance;
          but local coloring (as it is now called) is different,
          and the boys of this book are of Missouri and not of New
          England in a good many of their ways; and so they ought
          to be, being studies from life. We should not counsel New
          England boys to expect or to imitate some of the
          adventures in this book, but they doubtless are true
          enough to the society they sketch. The Missouri boy who
          has mighty stirrings in his soul and feels deeply the
          desperate injustice of his tender home, may want to go
          away and be a noble river pirate, just as the New England
          boy is sometimes moved to run away to sea. But neither of
          them we fancy ever finds or makes a pot of money by any
          sudden streak of luck.</p>

          <p>We do not believe that Tom Sawyer or his comrades have
          the least idea how bright a boy he is, or what
          exceedingly funny things he says; he is as bright as Mark
          Twain himself. And probably no boy will appreciate the
          deep fun and satire of the following passage. In a
          midnight adventure of Tom and his companion, Huckleberry,
          the boys think they are lost and fall into a panic.

            hookey and doing everything a feller's told <i>not</i>
            to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried --
            but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off
            this time, I lay I'll just <i>waller</i> in
            Sunday-schools!" And Tom began to snuffle a
            little.<br />
            &#x00A0; &#x00A0; "<i>You</i> bad!" and Huckleberry began
            to snuffle too. "Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just
            old pie, 'longside o' what I am. Oh, <i>lordy</i>,
            lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."

          <p>The Sunday-school chapter, in which Tom's financial
          abilities come out strong, and he trades himself into the
          possession of the first prize, and in which he exhibits
          his Biblical knowledge, is saturated with the keenest
          humor; but a boy will hardly comprehend the fine
          observation and deep satirical humor of the scene. It is
          prize day and company is present. On the platform is the
          great Judge Thatcher, the county judge, and it is an
          important hour for Mr. Walters, the superintendent, and
          for the whole school. It was an impressive silence when
          Jeff Thatcher, the brother of the judge, observed by
          "ranks of staring eyes," went forward to be familiar with
          the great man and be envied by the <a name=

            Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of
            official bustlings and activities, giving orders,
            delivering judgments, discharging directions here,
            there, everywhere that he could find a target. The
            librarian "showed off" -- running hither and thither
            with his arms full of books and making a deal of the
            splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in.
            The young lady teachers "showed off" -- bending sweetly
            over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting
            pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting
            good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers
            "showed off" with small scoldings and other little
            displays of authority and fine attention to discipline
            -- and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found
            business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was
            business that frequently had to be done over again two
            or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little
            girls "showed off" in various ways, and the little boys
            "showed off" with such diligence that the air was thick
            with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above
            it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial
            smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun
            of his own grandeur -- for he was "showing off," too.

          <p>Tom is a genuine boy and his Aunt Polly is a genuine
          woman; both are capitally drawn; and the author has given
          to both some noble traits and elements of pathos which
          make them remain our friends long after the laughter they
          excite has ceased. The book is full of quotable things,
          scenes as amusing as anything Mr. Clemens has written,
          with now and then a stroke of good humored satire that is
          as well deserved as it is artistically administered--take
          the school examination and exhibition as a specimen; the
          remarks on the "compositions" of the young ladies might
          well be framed and hung up in every school room. But it
          is unnecessary to quote from a book which everybody will
          read.</p>
