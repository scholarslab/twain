  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 5</h3>

  <p>The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the
  prayer, he only endured it -- if he even did that much. He was
  restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the
  prayer, unconsciously -- for he was not listening, but he knew
  the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it --
  and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear
  detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
  additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a
  fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured
  his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its
  head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed
  to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a
  neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs
  and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails;
  going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was
  perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's
  hands</p>

  itched to grab for it they did not dare -- he believed his soul
  would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the
  prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began
  to curve and steal forward; and the instant the "Amen" was out
  the fly was a prisoner of war.
