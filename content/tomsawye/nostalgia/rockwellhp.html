    <h2>Illustrations by Norman Rockwell</h2>

    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; Norman Rockwell was born in 1894 in on the
      upper west side of Manhattan. His career began with
      illustrations for children's books and magazines, but during
      the 1920s his covers for popular periodicals like <i>The
      Saturday Evening Post</i> had made him one of the country's
      best known artists. By 1935, when the Heritage Press
      commissioned him to do the artwork for their deluxe editions
      of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huck Finn</i>, he was widely
      beloved for his depictions of what a <i>World Book</i>
      encylopedia article calls "the people who live in everybody's
      home town," barefoot boys in particular.<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; For each MT novel Rockwell created 8 oil
      paintings which were tipped in as full-page illustrations,
      and a set of charcoal drawings used as chapter headings.
      <i>Below</i> are two of his <i>Tom Saywer</i> illustrations.
      His representation of the fence Tom manages to have
      whitewashed, <font size="-1"><b><a href=
      "javascript:Start2('tsrockfrx.jpg')">COMPARED WITH THE ACTUAL
      FENCE</a></b></font>, shows that for this picture, at least,
      Rockwell used a photograph to create an impression of
      realism. But as a whole his paintings emerge from the same
      psychology of nostalgia as Twain's text: "Injun Joe" remains
      invisible; only a total of three adults appear in them; work,
      and even a whipping, seem like child's play.<br /></td>
