      <td><i>This two-part article appeared in an issue of the</i>
      Mentor <i>devoted entirely to MT. It describes Hannibal as
      both "bustling city" and a child's "playground" -- a town
      looking simultaneously forward to a thriving future and
      backward to an eternal past. As it gives details about
      efforts to preserve the Clemens' house and to create a new
      shrine to MT in his birthplace in Florida, Missouri, it
      implies how the "city's" prosperity is beginning to be
      identified with the myth of MT's fictional "village." It
      claims, for example, the idea for a MT "Memorial Park" arose
      in the mind of a camp-fire girl, but goes on to reveal the
      fact that her father just happens to be the secretary of the
      local Chamber of Commerce. Other details suggest how a
      tourist economy is growing up.</i></td>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hannibal, Missouri, a bustling, wide-awake
        American city of over twenty thousand, would never be
        recognized to-day as "the poor little shabby village of St.
        Petersburg" of Tom Sawyer's day. Indeed, in later years
        when Mark Twain visited the town of his boyhood he
        expressed surprise and admiration for its improved
        appearance and progressiveness.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The mile-wide Mississippi is magnificent
        there, with "Pirate's Island" just across from the railroad
        yards, and Lovers' Leap, and Holliday's Hill to the north,
        blocking the further progress of Main Street, for Hannibal
        was a "Main Street town in the reign of Tom" and "Huck" and
        "Injun Joe."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nature made Hannibal a playground for
        youth at the cost of not one cent to the municipality. The
        hand of man could not improve upon it.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It provided a towering hill down which
        great boulders could be started, to land on the street far
        below with a delicious crash. It created bays and islands,
        fishing holes and swimming pools, far-reaching stretches of
        gloomy woodland, crevices and hollows, and capped it all
        with a mysterious cave that had no end! "It was said that
        one might wander days and nights through its intricate
        tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find an end of the
        cave." . . .</p><br />

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some years before the death of Mark Twain,
        Mr. and Mrs. George A. Mahan of Hannibal purchased the
        Clemens house, and presented it to the city as a permanent
        memorial. It is kept in as near as possible the same shape
        as when the family occupied it. The little back yard is
        there, almost exactly as when Jim Wolf, the printer boy,
        undertaking to shoo away the cats, fell through the grape
        trellis and landed on the hot candy Parmela and her girl
        friends put out there to cool. Mrs. Mary Wirtz, the matron,
        is asked to often by tourists about the "cats" that she has
        one as a regular attach&eacute; of the house to satisfy
        their curiosity. . . .</p><br />

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the most relentless character ever
        created by Mark Twain was "Injun Joe," the savage
        half-breed of Hannibal. Readers of Tom Sawyer will remember
        him well.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But Doc Brown . . . declared he knew
        "Injun Joe" well, and that he was not a bad man at all. He
        said he ran with the boys and helped them in hunting
        rabbits and 'possums, and showing them good places to fish.
        "Injun Joe" finally became a deck hand on the ferryboat, he
        said, and died of pneumonia.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When the Mark Twain statue was erected in
        the River View Park at Hannibal, a question arose about the
        word "humorist" in the inscription. The monument committee
        favored it, but Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine opposed it on the
        ground that Mark Twain's career was far greater than that
        of a "humorist."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; While the matter was being discussed, the
        writer asked Mr. Mahan how he would classify Missouri's
        noted son.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "A citizen of the world," replied Mr.
        Mahan. "That is big enough to cover the matter, for all the
        world loved Mark Twain." Then he added:</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Take him as a whole, I would say Mark
        Twain was a man who invested lavishly in humanity's stock,
        and made the dividends payable to the world."</p><br />

          <font size="+2">MARK TWAIN MEMORIAL PARK</font>
        </center>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; During the year 1923 a Mark Twain Memorial
        Park was created, consisting of one hundred and six acres
        of land adjoining the village of Florida, Missouri, where
        Mark Twain was born and where he played and hunted when a
        boy. An organization has the matter in charge, and the
        schools, newspapers, and Mark Twain societies in all the
        towns of the state are raising the fund required to
        establish the park and maintain it in a style worthy of the
        man whose memory will keep it green.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A twelve-year-old camp-fire girl, Ruth
        Lamson of Moberly, suggested the idea of a park. Ruth and
        her comrades had enjoyed their vacation amidst the
        fascinating scenery along the little river for several
        years, the guests of M. A. Violette, owner of the Mark
        Twain birthplace at Florida. Mr. Violette had put up
        several rustic camping houses for the girls, and of course
        they called him "Dad," which he accepts as a mark of
        affection--as it is.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Dad" Violette's camp-fire girls were not
        the pioneers, however, in the discovery that the Salt River
        country was the prettiest and most rugged in northern
        Missouri. Sam Clemens made it the playground of his youth,
        when he would spend his summers at Florida as the
        well-loved guest of his remarkable uncle Judge John A.
        Quarles. The Clemens family lived in Hannibal then.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Judge Quarles ran a store at Florida, and
        owned a farm near the place. In his autobiography Mark
        Twain gave a pretty fair inventory of that store from
        memory, and the prices at which articles were sold. He
        recalled that, "if a boy bought five or ten cents' worth of
        anything, he was entitled to half a handful of sugar from
        the barrel." If the customer were a woman, she was entitled
        to a spool of thread with her purchase. If a man bought
        some goods--no matter how trivial--his "prize" was a drink
        of whisky. Whisky sold then (from 1830 to 1840) at ten
        cents a gallon!</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The author of "Innocents Abroad" returned
        in his last years to the old Missouri playground, the
        woodlands they are going to transform into a beautiful park
        in his honor. In one of his most famous addresses--on the
        celebration of his attaining three-score years and ten--he
        voiced his vision of the old playground.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "I can see the woods in their autumn
        dress, the oaks' purple, the hickories washed with gold,
        the maples and the sumacs luminous with crimson fires, and
        I can hear the rustle of the fallen leaves as we plowed
        through them. I can see the blue clusters of wild grapes
        hanging amongst the foliage of the saplings, and I remember
        the taste of them and the smell. I know how the wild
        blackberries looked, and how they tasted; and the papaws,
        the hazelnuts, and the persimmons; and I can feel the
        thumping rain of hickory nuts and of walnuts upon my head
        when we were out in the frosty dawn to scramble for them
        when the gusts of wind loosened and sent them down."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Dad" Violette saved the Clemens home some
        ten years ago when the owner was about to wreck it for
        firewood. He bought and repaired it, all but a lean-to,
        which had rotted too badly to restore. When Mark Twain saw
        the house on one of his later visits to Florida he
        commented upon the absence of the lean-to. He remarked that
        the little house was in better shape than when he saw it
        after he moved to Hannibal.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Ruth Lamson spoke of the park idea to
        "Dad" Violette, who immediately became interested. The
        girl's father, Frank B. Lamson, is secretary of the Moberly
        Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Lamson decided that as Mark Twain
        had been a printer, and newspaper man, the men of those
        crafts should take hold of the matter. The result was the
        organization of the Mark Twain Memorial Association.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Violette has agreed to give the Mark
        Twain home for the park, together with its valuable
        contents of pioneer relics. There are two Seth Thomas
        clocks, one said to be one hundred and thirty-five years
        old and the other one hundred years. There is an old
        spinning wheel, also Indian axes, arrow heads, ancient guns
        and swords, and so on.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In a prominent place in the park it is
        proposed to erect a statue to represent "Tom Sawyer" and
        "Huck Finn." The entrance by way of Florida will be through
        an imposing gateway, the arch overhead bearing the
        inscription "Mark Twain Memorial Park."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Mark Twain Park Association was
        granted a decree of incorporation in February. The
        development scheme, as worked out by Horace Major, the
        University of Missouri landscape artist, includes roads,
        buildings, landscaping, electric lights, waterworks, and
        other interesting features.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Newspapers, schools, and interested
        individuals in Missouri are working enthusiastically over
        this beautiful memorial to the man who laughed through
        life, and who made so many millions of his fellow men
        laugh--and think.</p>
