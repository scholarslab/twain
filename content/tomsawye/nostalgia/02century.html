        <p>BEAUTIFUL for situation is the lovely little city of
        Hannibal, on the Mississippi, the boyhood home of Mr.
        Samuel L. Clemens, known the world over as "Mark Twain."
        The hills are high, the valley is picturesque, the houses
        are handsome and comfortable. The town claims a population
        of fifteen thousand, and is just now enjoying a boom,
        recent discoveries of deposits having been made that will
        greatly enrich the place. On a late visit I endeavored to
        gather some information regarding Hannibal's "first
        citizen," with the following result.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; Mr. Clemens must have been acquainted with
        Hannibal for a long time, for he has recently said that he
        has known the place ever since "Lovers' Leap" was a
        mole-hill and the Mississippi River a small creek.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; The local tradition remembers the father of the
        humorist, "Squire" Clemens, as a good and peaceable
        citizen. He brought to the town with him his wife and
        children, and nothing unusual is remembered of the family,
        except that Mrs. Clemens had a peculiar and interesting
        drawl in her speech. When her son lectured in the town
        theater she called the attention of the neighbors to the
        fact that "Sam had a mighty long drawl to his talk, and she
        wondered where in the world he had got it." Whereupon an
        old farmer remarked, "If the dam is a pacer, you will very
        likely find an amble in the colt." They brought up their
        children as well as circumstances would allow, considering
        three things, the Civil War, the West on the river, and the
        children. It is generally believed that "Aunt Polly," in
        "Tom Sawyer" was "Sam's" own mother, and that Tom was Sam.
        If this is so, one can almost read the family history in
        that captivating little book. . . .</p>

        <p>&nbsp; In his writings Mr. Clemens sometimes gives the
        real name of one of his characters, and one will find, upon
        investigation, that his picture is true to life. Among
        these, I will mention two extremes, Huckleberry Finn and
        Laura Hawkins, who figures as Becky Thatcher. One was in
        the lower walks of life, living on charity, sleeping in old
        barrels, and covering himself with such rags as might fall
        to his lot; the other was a beautiful, accomplished girl, a
        strong and lovely character, the pride and belle of the
        village. It was lately my good fortune to meet the lady,
        Mrs. F-----, whose youth was thus celebrated. She is
        happily engaged in a work of charity, and one can see by
        her kindly face and cheerful nature that she is well
        qualified for such a delicate and noble work. By Mr.
        Clemens's own confession, she was his first sweetheart, as
        may be seen by his wedding announcement sent to her with an
        indorsement in his own handwriting that such was the case.
        I had this photographed, but the passing years have so
        dimmed the words that it is difficult to decipher them. I
        have also procured a photograph of the entrance of the now
        famous cave, in which one can, in imagination, follow the
        steps of the two children Tom and Becky, rambling about the
        cave with candles held high above their heads, running,
        walking, climbing, peering into every dark passageway, and
        sometimes venturing in, until suddenly they realize that
        they have been separated from the other members of the
        party and are lost. . . .</p>

        <p>&nbsp; Mr. Clemens holds a safe place in the affections
        and esteem of the citizens of Hannibal. His name is a
        household word, a possession of local pride, and all claim
        a personal interest in their gifted fellow-citizen. How
        wonderful is the spell of humor! As long as boys shall
        climb those hills or float along the Mississippi, as long
        indeed as the English language is read, the name of "Mark
        Twain" will be known and honored, and the mere mention of
        the humorist will serve to bring a smile to the face of
        sorrow and lighten the burdens of many a weary life.</p>
