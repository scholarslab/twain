        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Years ago they erected in a London Park, a
        statue of Peter Pan. A fanciful, appealing little figure;
        the figure of a boy that never was and never will be. Huck
        Finn and Tom Sawyer--like Peter Pan--are only characters in
        fiction, but in every way how tremendously different! Peter
        Pan is a fairy child, a whimsical creation. He is "the
        little boy who never grew up." There is nothing whimsical
        or fanciful or fairy-like about Huck and Tom. They are very
        solid flesh, they are about as real as anything we know.
        They are eternal boys for us, because we know them only as
        boys. They have never "grown up," but their immortal youth
        is not due to any enchantment or fairy trick. Their creator
        (Mark Twain) spared us the wretchedness of thinking of them
        as men.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom Sawyer's book is a boy's story; the
        adventures of Huckleberry Finn make a book for the comfort
        of all Americans. Both are books of pure delight. Perhaps
        no two other American books have brought so much unalloyed
        entertainment to American readers.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So real are Huck and Tom that the monument
        to be unveiled will not seem fanciful. It will perpetuate
        solidly two genuine Americans who have done more than a
        little to make American life enjoyable. They have probably
        done more than Peter Pan--but comparisons between the
        dainty fairy boy and the ragged Huck Finn are utterly
        impossible. Peter in his London Park and Huck and Tom atop
        Cardiff Hill in Hannibal each in his own way emphasizes the
        wonder of youth and persuades us to think of young
        thoughts. There can be no rivalry in such good work.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The title for the new statue to be
        unveiled this spring might well be termed "Starting Out On
        Mischief Bent." It has given to Hannibal and Northeast
        Missouri, world-wide recognition through the efforts of the
        donors. We estimate that this publicity is worth at least a
        million dollars for Hannibal. It is publicity that money
        cannot buy.</p>
