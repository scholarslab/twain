        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> town of
        Hannibal, Missouri, has had a number of things to
        distinguish it during its eighty years of existence:
        business men are acquainted with it as the one-time centre
        of the largest lumber trade on the Mississippi River; for
        lawyers it has furnished some of the most interesting
        criminal cases on record; the readers of sensational news
        know it as furnishing many opportunities to the lover of
        "scare-heads" in journalism; preachers have regarded it for
        years as a promising field for evangelistic effort; but
        literary people are interested in it chiefly as the boyhood
        home of Mark Twain and the scene of his earliest
        writings.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It has changed much since Tom Sawyer's
        "gang" made things lively for the sleepy little village of
        St. Petersburg. The town has reached out until it sweeps
        around Lover's Leap on one side and straggles up Holiday's
        Hill on the other. Widened, well-paved streets stretch out
        to the westward, well set with substantial business houses
        and modern dwellings. Walking along these streets you meet
        well-dressed women, brisk men, and decorous-looking
        children; and there is little to remind you of rollicking,
        incorrigible Tom and angular old-fashioned "Aunt Polly,"
        who thumped his head and loved him with all the ardor of
        her warm old heart.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You say, with a sense of disappointment:
        "It is not what it was. The place has changed, and the
        people too." But wait a little. Let us walk out Main Street
        a few squares. You see that hill rising directly before
        you, with what seems to be the remains of an old quarry on
        one side and a few clusters of foliage clinging to the
        other? It requires a small effort of the imagination to
        clothe it once more with original forest. Obliterate the
        modern cottages scattered over it, restore the Welchman's
        cabin, and you have Holiday's Hill much as it was when Huck
        and Tom clambered over it on their way to the Haunted House
        to dig for buried treasure.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There to the left is a drug-store. It was
        a drug-store fifty years ago, with the same name beside the
        doorway, and the same druggist dispensing pills and powders
        from behind the same counter. The Hannibal Weekly Journal,
        owned and edited by Orion Clemens, was printed for a while
        in the rooms over this drug-store; and here, according to
        the recent statement of Mr. Samuel Moffett, "the
        thirteen-year-old boy served in all capacities, and, in the
        occasional absences of his chief, revelled in personal
        journalism, with original illustrations hacked on wooden
        blocks with a jack-knife, to an extent which riveted the
        town's attention, 'but not its admiration.'"</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start2('mthaunts07.html')"><img src=
        "mthaunts07t.jpg" alt="HARPER'S MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn into one of the
        cross-streets and look about you. You are in the Hannibal
        of fifty years ago, picturesque and unpainted externally,
        cobwebby and deserted internally. Walk a short distance out
        Hill Street, and you come to the plain little frame house
        which was the home of the Clemens family during the greater
        part of their residence in Hannibal. Immediately in the
        rear of it, on North Street, is a tumble-down shanty which
        was the home of Thomas Blankenship, better known to the
        public as Huckleberry Finn.</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start('mthaunts02.html')"><img src=
        "mthaunts02t.jpg" alt="HARPER'S MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; One surviving member
        of this family remains--a sister of the illustrious Huck.
        She seems, however, to be little impressed with the
        distinction conferred on the family. When questioned as to
        the identity of her brother with Mark Twain's hero, she
        said:</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, I reckon it was him. Sam and our
        boys run together considerable them days, and I reckon it
        was Tom or Ben, one; it don't matter which, for both of
        'em's dead."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Evidently it was not given to more than
        one, in those days, to see the possibilities in a character
        like Huckleberry Finn.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "He was nothing more than a plain
        reprobate," one of the old "boys" declared. "I knew him,
        and I could never see anything picturesque about him. The
        principal exploit of his which I now recall is the fact
        that he once stole a dearly prized kite of mine. He had
        been regarding it with envious eyes for days, and at last,
        when he knew I was not at home, he went around and told my
        mother that I had sent him for the kite. Of course he got
        it, and that was the last I ever saw of it; but I had my
        satisfaction"--with a stern, almost ferocious, expression:
        "I punched his head!"</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Evidently the memory of that theft still
        rankles, and renders the judge reluctant to acknowledge the
        fine points in a character like Huckleberry Finn,
        considered purely from a literary stand-point.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Turning back, you cross Main Street and
        come to what was once Water Street. You feel yourself miles
        and miles removed from the busy little city, which is still
        so close to you that sounds of its cheerful traffic are
        plainly audible. Not that this is really what it was, but,
        lying there in its desertion and decay, it is very
        suggestive of the drowsy, contented life of which Mark
        Twain wrote:</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "After all these years I can picture that
        old time to myself now, just as it was then: the white town
        drowsing in the sunshine of a summer morning; the streets
        empty, or pretty nearly so, one or two clerks sitting in
        front of the Water Street stores, with their
        splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against the wall, chins
        on breast, hats slouched over their faces, asleep--with
        shingle shavings enough around to show what broke them
        down; a sow and a litter of pigs loafing around the
        sidewalks, doing a lively business in watermelon rinds and
        seeds; two or three lonely little freight-piles scattered
        about the 'levee,' a pile of 'skids' on the slope of the
        stone-paved wharf, and the fragrant town-drunkard asleep in
        the shadow of them; two or three wood flats at the head of
        the wharf, but nobody to listen to the peaceful lapping of
        the wavelets against them; the great Mississippi, the
        magnificent Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along,
        shining in the sun, the dense forest away on the other
        side; the 'point' above town and the 'point' below town,
        bounding the river-glimpse and turning it into a sort of
        sea, and withal a very still, and brilliant, and lonely
        one."</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start2('mthaunts05.html')"><img src=
        "mthaunts05t.jpg" alt="HARPER'S MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; A short distance
        below town, lying on this still and shining sea, is a
        wooded island which has been known by various names--the
        Jackson's Island on which "The Black Avenger of the Spanish
        Main" grounded his raft and landed his pirate crew on their
        first voyage of adventure and conquest. Since then it has
        been called Pete's Island, in honor of the chief of an
        older and more formidable band of pirates who had their
        rendezvous there. It has also been known as Glasscock's
        Island, and at present is Pearl Island.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You are perhaps a traveller, something of
        a mountain-climber, so you will not mind the walk to the
        top of Holiday's Hill, from which point we have a view of
        the river and town, with the wooded shore on the Illinois
        side. Let Mark Twain describe it for us, as he comes back
        to it after a number of years, with a vision broadened by
        travel and experience, and a heart warm with tender
        memories:</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "It was a Sunday morning, and everybody
        was abed yet. So I passed through the vacant streets, still
        seeing the town as it was and not as it is, and recognizing
        and metaphorically shaking hands with a hundred familiar
        objects which no longer exist, and finally climbing
        Holiday's Hill to get a comprehensive view. The whole town
        spread out before me then, and I could mark and fix every
        locality, every detail. Naturally I was a good deal moved.
        I said, 'Many of the people I once knew in this tranquil
        refuge of my childhood are now in heaven; some, I trust,
        are in the other place.'</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "From this vantage-ground the extensive
        view up and down the river, and wide over the wooded
        expanse of Illinois, is very beautiful--one of the most
        beautiful on the Mississippi, I think; which is a hazardous
        remark to make, for the eight hundred miles of river
        between St. Louis and St. Paul afford an unbroken
        succession of lovely pictures. It may be that my affection
        for the one in question biases my judgment in its favor; I
        cannot say as to that. No matter; it was satisfyingly
        beautiful to me, and it had the advantage over all other
        friends whom I was about to greet again--it had suffered no
        change; it was as fresh and comely and gracious as ever it
        had been; whereas the faces of the others would be scarred
        by the campaigns of life, and marked with their griefs and
        defeats, and would give me no upliftings of spirit."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking north from Holiday's Hill is a
        picturesque bit of country, the bluffs closing about a
        narrow gorge, through which flows the stream known in those
        days as the Still-House Branch. Here, through long lazy
        afternoons, Huck and Tom played Robin Hood, and here was
        located the Haunted House where "Injun Joe" found the
        buried treasure. We may believe this but little changed. A
        few houses cluster about the opening at the railroad, and
        as we stop to make some inquiries about localities a
        barefooted boy with a dilapidated hat two sizes too large
        for him comes and leans against the fence and regards us
        with frank, unflattering eyes. Another joins him, and we
        hear them addressed as "Buck" and "Bill." Seeing no
        prospect of diversion, they vault over the low board fence
        and disappear in the bushes which skirt the hill-side.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After all, we think, localities may
        change, but human nature, if let alone, remains about the
        same. We may build fine houses, and dress and groom, and
        prune and train, until we succeed in raising up a
        generation of children looking like fashion plates and
        acting like little old men and women, but give it half a
        chance and it springs up into the same rollicking, untamed
        creature of luxuriant fancy and inexhaustible resources as
        the two boys who have been the emulation and delight of
        several generations of children.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps this explains, in some degree, the
        unfailing interest which still attaches to these early
        books of Mark Twain. Other writers have given us excellent
        studies of human nature--of child nature--but the types are
        imperfect, and so wrought about by peculiarities of style,
        national characteristics, and a thousand and one things, as
        to make a critical literary taste necessary to their full
        appreciation. Not so in this case. Mark Twain has given us
        not the boy of the Mississippi Valley as he was fifty years
        ago, but a broad type which finds ready interpreters in
        every nook and corner of the nation and in every passing
        generation.</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start1('mthaunts04.html')"><img src=
        "mthaunts04t.jpg" alt="HARPER'S MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; About two miles
        below town is the cave in which Tom had some of his most
        thrilling adventures. The opening lies well back in the
        side of a hill, with a pretty park and athletic ground
        around it, which are in frequent use for picnics and ball
        games. Passing inside, you thread the same labyrinth of
        narrow corridors, with rifts dropping off at your feet as
        if into the very bowels of the earth. Here is the spring of
        clear, cold water where Tom and Becky sat down to watch
        their last bit of candle go out, leaving them in dense and
        utter darkness. There is the corridor known as "Bat Alley,"
        where myriads of those creatures cling to walls and
        ceiling, and, disturbed by the light of your torch, beat
        about your head in a manner far from comfortable.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The small stream known as Bear Creek, "so
        called, perhaps, because it was always so particularly bare
        of bears," skirts the town on the south side, and
        notwithstanding his statement that only an expert can find
        it, a number of present-day boys are intimately acquainted
        with all the swimming-holes, and Mark Twain's personal
        experience is frequently repeated: "I used to get drowned
        in it regularly every summer, and be drained out and
        inflated and set going again by some chance enemy, but not
        enough of it is unoccupied now to drown a person in. It was
        a famous breeder of chills and fever in my day. I remember
        one summer when everybody in the town had the disease at
        once. Many chimneys were shaken down, and all the houses so
        racked that the town had to be rebuilt."</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start1('mthaunts03.html')"><img src=
        "mthaunts03t.jpg" alt="HARPER'S MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; The shabby little
        brick church where the children of that day attended
        Sunday-school, and suffered through the eternity of a long
        Presbyterian sermon, is now used as a court-house. We have
        it on good authority that the picture of the painfully
        clean boy standing at the door of this church on Sunday
        morning, trading licorice, fish-hooks, and marbles for
        tickets of various colors and values, and through this
        traffic obtaining the distinction of a prize pupil,
        notwithstanding the fact that he was never known to recite
        two verses, not to mention two thousand, is in no respect
        overdrawn. The boys and girls who attended that school also
        recall vividly the superintendent, a man named Cross, to
        whom they affectionately referred as "Cross by name and
        cross by nature."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In searching for boyhood friends and
        companions of Mark Twain we are reminded of the condition
        of things in the village of St. Petersburg immediately
        after the supposed drowning of Tom Sawyer and Joe Harper,
        when disputes arose as to who saw the dead boys last in
        life, and those who could establish such claim "took to
        themselves airs of sacred importance."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "One poor chap, who had no other grandeur
        to offer, said, with tolerably manifest pride in the
        remembrance,</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "'Well, Tom Sawyer, he licked me
        once!'"</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "But that bid for glory was a failure.
        Most of the boys could say that much, and so it cheapened
        the distinction too much."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; By all odds the most interesting character
        connected with the history of those years is Mrs. A. L.
        Frazer, formerly Miss Laura Hawkins, presumably the Becky
        Thatcher of Tom Sawyer, and the Laura Hawkins of The Gilded
        Age. A very gentle and winsome lady she is, with wavy gray
        locks about her face, eyes as sparkling as any girl's, and
        a charm of manner which marks the genuine woman, no matter
        what station in life may claim her. Mrs. Frazer enjoys
        talking about her old play-mate, not because he has grown
        great and famous, but because he was her old play-mate. Her
        heart warms to the memory of those halcyon days, and in her
        regard there mingles no questioning of the world's
        opinions, no weighing of possible honors. It is one of
        those tender and unselfish friendships which some very
        lovable women are capable of inspiring and cherishing
        through a long lifetime.</p>

        <p><a href="javascript:Start('mthaunts06.html')"><img src=
        "mthaunts06t.jpg" alt="HARPER'S MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATION" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; "I remember very
        well when we moved into the house opposite where Mr. John
        M. Clemens lived," she said. "I remember also the first
        time I ever saw Mark Twain. He was then a barefooted boy,
        and he came out in the street before our house and turned
        hand-springs, and stood on his head, and cut just such
        capers as he describes in Tom's 'showing off' before Becky.
        We were good friends from the first. One of our favorite
        play-places was in the Clemens yard, where we built houses
        out of a heap of bricks. On one occasion he accidentally
        tumbled our house down on my hand and made blood blisters
        on every finger.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "On another occasion a crowd of boys and
        girls went out on the hills of what is now Palmyra Avenue,
        to spend a Saturday afternoon. The hill-sides were covered
        with trees and brush, and a favorite sport was to bend down
        slender saplings and ride, the smaller girls being taken on
        behind the larger ones. I was having a fine ride behind one
        of the big girls when she suddenly sprang off, and I was
        thrown to the ground, striking my head against a stone. I
        was taken home unconscious, and was very ill for some time,
        and I remember hearing the children talk about how scared
        and anxious 'Sam' was."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We can but wonder if it was this illness
        which so wrought on Tom's health and spirits, and if it was
        his own condition which he so feelingly describes as he
        tells of the boy hanging around the gate of the school-yard
        anxiously watching for the coming of Becky: "Presently Jeff
        Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; but he
        gazed a moment, then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff
        arrived, Tom accosted him and 'led up' warily to
        opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad
        never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping
        whenever a whisking frock came in sight, and hating the
        owner of it whenever he saw she was not the right one. At
        last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped down into the
        dumps; he entered the empty school-house and sat down to
        suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and
        Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out
        and 'going on' like an Indian, yelling, laughing, chasing
        boys, jumping over fences at the risk of life and limb,
        throwing hand-springs, standing on his head, doing all the
        heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive
        eye out all the while to see if Becky Thatcher was
        noticing."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If others in the town were unable to see
        Huck Finn with Mark Twain's eyes, the same difficulty did
        not obtain in this case, for his little sweetheart seems to
        have been a universal favorite. One of the old "boys" tells
        the story of how on one occasion three of the "gang"
        started out into the great world to seek their fortune,
        with the understanding that on their return one of the
        number should marry Laura Hawkins. How the lucky one was to
        be chosen he fails to relate, but it is safe to say that if
        the matter had come to settlement after the manner in which
        boys usually adjust difficulties, Mark Twain would have had
        at least "a fighting chance." But alas for the brave
        knights! When they returned the princess was gone! She
        might have been carried off in their absence by a dreadful
        ogre, or a rival prince might have spirited her away to his
        castle, but the unpoetical fact was that her father had
        moved away, and that was the end of this little
        romance.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the event of his marriage, Mark Twain
        enclosed a card to the brother of Mrs. Frazer, and on the
        inner cover was written:</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs. ----- (married name unknown to
        me).</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (Formerly Miss Laura Hawkins, first
        sweetheart of one of the within named parties 29 years ago.
        Pardon the suggestive figures.)</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the sloping hill-sides of beautiful
        Mount Olivet are to be found as many friends and boyhood
        companions of the great humorist as walk the streets of the
        busy little city two miles away. Here on the very summit,
        where a rift in the foliage on intervening hills opens a
        view of the great, placid, shining river, is the lot with
        its simple head-stones where the greater part of the
        Clemens family are sleeping. There is John M. Clemens, the
        kindly, dignified, if somewhat unfortunate father, about
        whom one hears only the tenderest and most respectful
        reminiscences; next to him the mother, from whom her
        distinguished son is said to have inherited some of the
        traits which have made him famous; Henry Clemens, the
        younger brother, who lost his life in a steamboat explosion
        at Memphis; and last in the row, Orion Clemens, the elder
        brother, under whose tutelage Samuel Clemens began his
        literary career.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In his recent biographical sketch, Mr.
        Samuel Moffett says:</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Native character will always make itself
        felt, but one may wonder whether Mark Twain's humor would
        have developed in quite so sympathetic and buoyant a vein
        if he had been brought up in Ecclefechan instead of in
        Hannibal, and whether Carlyle might not have been a little
        more human if he had spent his boyhood in Hannibal instead
        of in Ecclefechan."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Without claiming an intimate knowledge of
        the facilities afforded by Ecclefechan for the development
        of native character, we venture the belief that not
        Ecclefechan nor any other locality could have furnished
        better facilities for the untrammelled development of this
        native genius than it enjoyed in Hannibal.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before all and above all, Mark Twain is a
        great interpreter of human nature--not the groomed and
        polished species of the drawing-room, but the unpruned and
        untrained article which grew up spontaneously in such
        congenial soil as Hannibal afforded fifty years ago. Call
        it fatalism or faith, but circumstance, or Providence,
        usually places within a man's reach just the facilities
        necessary for the making of his individual character and
        the accomplishment of his peculiar work. Not all the
        universities in all the land could have done so much for
        Mark Twain as did the contact with primitive life and
        character in this river town, and the later and wider
        experience of a pilot on the Mississippi River.</p>
