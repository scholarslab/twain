          <h3>"In Commemoration of the Birth of S. L. Clemens"</h3>
        </center>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This 24-page "souvenir" of Hannibal's 1935
        MT Centennial celebration was edited and designed by
        someone named Braxton Pollard, and published locally
        sometime after the year's inaugural event, the 15 January
        illumination of the Memoral Lighthouse by F.D.R. by
        long-distance from the White House. It keeps its focus on
        the MT of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> (referring frequently to Sam
        Clemens as "Tom") and "Old Times on the Mississippi"
        (though the Clemens family had left Hannibal before Sam
        started learning the river as a cub pilot), and on old-time
        Hannibal as Tom's "St. Petersburg" (it shows us the
        swimming hole, for instance, and only one "slave" is ever
        mentioned: the girl who rescues "Tom" from drowning on page
        8).</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It begins with The Cave, which had been
        charging visitors admission since the 1880s. But as a whole
        it is not overtly commerical. For example, it mentions the
        new bridge being constructed across the Mississippi and the
        "thousands of tourists" who will use it to "cross the
        nation," but doesn't work very hard to encourage them to
        stop at Hannibal. It contains no ads, nor any reference to
        tourist attractions. Instead, it boasts about "shoe
        factories, cement mills," and other industries, and talks
        about how Tom Sawyer's "playground" has "indeed grown up"
        into a "city."</p>
