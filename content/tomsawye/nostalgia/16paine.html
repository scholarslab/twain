          AND UNCLE JOHN QUARLES' FARM</b></font>
        </center>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; HANNIBAL was a town with prospects and
        considerable trade. It was slumbrous, being a slave town,
        but it was not dead. John Clemens believed it a promising
        place for business, and opened a small general store with
        Orion Clemens, now fifteen, a studious, dreamy lad, for
        clerk.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The little city was also an attractive
        place of residence. Mark Twain remembered it as "the white
        town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer morning, . . .
        the great Mississippi, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling
        its mile-wide tide along, . . . the dense forest away on
        the other side."</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The "white town" was built against green
        hills, and abutting the river were bluffs--Holliday's Hill
        and Lover's Leap. A distance below the town was a cave--a
        wondrous cave, as every reader of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
        knows--while out in the river, toward the Illinois shore,
        was the delectable island that was one day to be the
        meeting-place of Tom's pirate band, and later to become the
        hiding-place of Huck and Nigger Jim.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The river itself was full of interest. It
        was the highway to the outside world. Rafts drifted by;
        smartly painted steamboats panted up and down, touching to
        exchange traffic and travelers, a never-ceasing wonder to
        those simple shut-in dwellers whom the telegraph and
        railway had not yet reached. That Hannibal was a pleasant
        place of residence we may believe, and what an attractive
        place for a boy to grow up in! . . .</p><br />

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; He had learned a great deal of natural
        history and botany--the habits of plants, insects, and
        animals. Mark Twain's books bear evidence of this early
        study. His plants, bugs, and animals never do the wrong
        things. He was learning a good deal about men, and this was
        often less pleasant knowledge. Once Little Sam--he was
        still Little Sam then--saw an old man shot down on Main
        Street at noon-day. . . .</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw a young emigrant stabbed with a
        bowie-knife by a drunken comrade, and two young men try to
        kill their uncle, one holding him while the other snapped
        repeatedly an Allen revolver, which failed to go off. Then
        there was the drunken rowdy who proposed to raid the
        "Welshman's" house, one sultry, threatening evening--he saw
        that, too. . . .</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; That was a day and locality of violent
        impulse and sudden action. Happenings such as these were
        not infrequent in a town like Hannibal. And there were
        events connected with slavery. Sam once saw a slave struck
        down and killed with a piece of slag, for a trifling
        offense. He saw an Abolitionist attacked by a mob that
        would have lynched him had not a Methodist minister
        defended him on a plea that he must be crazy. He did not
        remember in later years that he had ever seen a slave
        auction, but he added:</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am suspicious that it was because the
        thing was a commonplace spectacle and not an uncommon or
        impressive one. I do vividly remember seeing a dozen black
        men and women, chained together, lying in a group on the
        pavement, waiting shipment to a Southern slave-market. They
        had the saddest faces I ever saw."</p>
