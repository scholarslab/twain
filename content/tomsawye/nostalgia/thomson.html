      <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Dave Thomson, this
      representation of Hannibal is based on Henry Lewis'
      sketchbook pages of 31 July 1848:<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; "The panorama was done in the style of a post
      office mural from the Depression-era WPA. The white building
      above the steamboat paddle box represents the office of
      Justice of the Peace J. M. Clemens (Sam's father). The
      Clemens family lived one block further back from the
      river.<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; "Using the 1854 map of Hart and Mapother as
      well as Ruger's 1869 bird's eye view I determined as closely
      as possible the materials the depicted buildings were made
      of, brick predominating with the white and gray buildings
      constructed from wood. The buildings on the far left are the
      pork slaughtering and packing business. The building on the
      far right I believe was a sawmill. Other pork packing
      businesses and a tobacco factory most likely occupied the
      neighboring buildings on the far right. The other brick
      structures would have been occupied by hostelries, merchants
      and tradesmen, warehouse facilities, &amp;c. As a foreground
      focal point I added the steamboat "Missouri" (aka the "Big
      Missouri"), which operated on the Mississippi from 1845-1851.
      The "Big Missouri" is the boat Ben Rogers impersonates in
      Chapter 2 of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; "The image was colorized with the help of my
      friend Ed Garbert. We put the light source in the east, as
      the village would appear in the morning (and since the town
      is laid out at a northwest to southeast angle parallel to the
      river, this is how the buildings are lit to best advantage).
      Ed 'painted' the majority of the buildings with a Photoshop
      program and I modified the foliage, added the steamboat and
      modified the color scheme.<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; "The <i>National Geographic</i> article 'The
      Mighty Mississippi' (1971) reproduces the two pages from
      Lewis' sketchbook on which this picture is based. My original
      black and white rendering to the panorama can be seen
      <a href="http://www.twainquotes.com/DaveThomson.html" target=
      "_new"><font size="-1">HERE</font></a>, and was featured on
      the cover and fly leaves of <i>Hannibal Too</i>, by Hurley
      and Roberta Hagood (1986)."<br /></td>
