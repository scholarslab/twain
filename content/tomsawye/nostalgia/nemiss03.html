        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The community which once eagerly welcomed
        the coming of a new railroad to its midst is today even
        more eagerly welcoming the establishment of a branch of a
        strongly organized American Automobile Association Club.
        For the Automobile Club will bring in annually a great
        influx of tourists, and these tourists usually are prepared
        to tarry in a community with scenic or historic spots of
        interest. In addition to this, an Automobile Club which
        exists for the purpose of public service and not the mere
        collection of membership fees will bring increased earnings
        to the community through its efforts to obtain the building
        of good roads, will work unselfishly for safety and
        convenience in driving through its sign-posting activities,
        will assist to obtain the passage of state and national
        legislation beneficial to the public at large--in fact will
        anticipate the every need of the motorist and earnestly
        strive to provide all that is necessary for the safe,
        pleasant, and economical operation of his automobile.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Automobile Club of Missouri has two
        branches in Northeast Missouri, one at Hannibal, the other
        at Moberly. The Hannibal Branch is located at the Mark
        Twain Hotel with Mar-</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A new department recently created by the
        club for the purpose of informing motorists of the beauties
        of the State is the Travel Bureau. The Travel Bureau
        consists of a filing rack containing pictures and general
        information of every town and resort spot in the State and
        is being placed in hotels and automobile club headquarters
        throughout the entire Middle West. Northeast Missouri is
        well-represented in the information (both pictorial and
        written) contained in the file of this State's scenic,
        historic and industrial resources, and it is conservatively
        predicted that the coming tourist season will find a far
        greater number of tourists being sent into this section of
        the State than have ever visited it before--and that the
        cause for this influx can be directly traced to the
        publicity given this section by the Automobile Club of
        Missouri through the branches of its Travel Bureau.</p>
