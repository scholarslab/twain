      <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Tom Sawyer's Island," according to the
      park's official website, is the only attraction at Disneyland
      that was designed by Walt Disney himself. As Bob Thomas tells
      the story, Disney was so dissatisfied with the conception of
      designer Marv Davis that he took the plans home: "That night
      he worked for hours in his red-barn workshop. The next
      morning, he laid tracing paper on Davis' desk and said, 'Now
      <i>that's</i> the way it should be.' The island was built
      according to his design." It opened to tourists in
      1957.<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Disney and Clemens were both from Missouri. The
      Disneyland steamboat that cruises around Tom's Island is
      named the <i>Mark Twain</i>. To get to the Island, however,
      you take a raft from either Frontierland or the Indian
      Village. Once there, the place is less the "safe playground"
      evoked by most recreations of St. Petersburg, and more a
      realm of imaginatively dangerous adventures, less a "white
      town drowsing" than an outpost of civilization perched on the
      edge of the impenetrable, hostile Indian territory. On the
      other hand, like the other representations of Tom Sawyer's
      past, Disney's omits any reference to slavery. You might
      still hear Joe howling in his cave, but no sign of Jim is to
      be found on the island.<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Below</i> is the brochure that the original
      travelers to the Island were given, containing both a map and
      a description of the island's attractions. Both the
      Disneyland and the Disneyworld versions of the Island have
      been revamped since their original openings. <b>Courtesy Dave
