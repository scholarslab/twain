      <td>[<i>In this article, Jerry Allen, author of a biography
      of MT published in 1954, describes a visit she makes to
      Hannibal. As you can tell from the excerpts</i> below<i>, she
      steps right from the anachronistic railroad train into land
      out of time -- the indulgently remembered time of</i> Tom
      Sawyer<i>. The article is illustrated with 17 photographs,
      but nearly all of them are dominated by children, and in 8 of
      them, including the 2 here, the children look like they got
      dressed in 1856, not 1956. The article contains only one
      reference to slavery; it's repeated in the caption to the
      photo</i> below left<i>. In Allen's article (unlike the
      remembered worlds of</i> Huck Finn <i>and</i> Pudd'nhead
      Wilson<i>), not even the thought of slaves being sold down
      the river disrupts the nostalgic reverie. After the excerpts
      you can see the way "The St. Petersburg of Tom Sawyer" looks
      on the map Allen mentions in the essay -- perhaps the only
      time in its history</i> The National Geographic <i>mapped a
      semi-imaginary realm.</i>]</td>

        <p>MARK TWAIN remembered it some seventy years ago as a
        "white town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's
        morning." Last year Hannibal, Missouri, tucked away in the
        heart of the country, attracted more American travelers
        than Hawaii, a fourth as many as Europe. The high roads and
        the back roads brought 127,000 visitors. . . .</p><br />

        <p>Cupped on the shore of the often-flooding Mississippi,
        Hannibal lies in a valley edged by 225-foot-high Lovers'
        Leap (map, page 125). It has neither beaches nor
        night-clubs--and teen-agers are subject to a 10 o'clock
        curfew. Crowds come by the busload and in streams of family
        cars, not for the town's majestic scenery, its climate or
        resort life, but because here, little changed by time, are
        the haunts of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Children, and the
        parents who tag along with them, have made it one of the
        most popular home towns in the United States. . .
        .</p><br />

          <b>Fables of Injun Joe Live On</b>
        </center>

        <p>Injun Joe died in the town of his fame some years ago,
        an aged and wrinkled half-breed Indian. Yet the awesome
        fables about him continue hardy and spiked with menace, as
        a comment I overheard one day on Cardiff Hill shows.</p>

        <p>"This is the place where Indian Bill murdered the
        widow," a schoolgirl, garbling her facts a little, told her
        parents. It was a clear day, a soft time of year, and the
        locust blooms were fragrant on the hill. But the mother
        looked warily around for "Indian Bill" and uneasily herded
        her family from the treacherous ground of fiction.</p>

        <p>Guides at the cave invariably point to a spot near the
        entrance where "Injun Joe died just where you're standing."
        And, invariably, adult visitors and children alike step
        hastily away. . . .</p><br />

        <p>A giant bronze statue of the writer in his later years
        stands in Hannibal's Riverview Park, overlooking the
        Mississippi from a height of 200 feet. The work of
        Frederick Hibbard, it was the 1913 gift of the State of
        Missouri and bears the inscription: "His religion was
        humanity and a whole world mourned for him when he
        died."</p>

        <p>Riverview Park of some 250 acres is also a gift to the
        town. A woodland Mark Twain knew as a boy, it was presented
        by the W. B. Pettibone family and is maintained by them. .
        . . Like other sights connected with Mark Twain's life in
        Hannibal, with the single exception of the cave, it is open
        to everyone without charge. Hannibal has not attempted to
        profit from his fame. The town owns many of its historic
        buildings and maintains them at taxpayers' cost. . .
        .</p><br />

        <p>In every country where Mark Twain is read--a circle of
        books that stretches around the globe--Hannibal is known in
        its dress of fiction under the many names its author gave
        it. Yet it was just a village on the Mississippi like many
        others until Mark Twain made it known as a paradise for
        boys. Today it is that still.</p>
