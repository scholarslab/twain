      of America's life in the Mississippi Valley in the middle of
      the 19th century. He compares that world to both the Garden
      of Eden and Elizabethan England, and calls it a "pure
      democracy," "as democratic" as any community in the world's
      history -- though the adjective "slave-holding" does get
      applied to it too, when he uses a piece from W. D. Howells'

        <p>THE name under which Mr. Samuel L. Clemens has written
        for many years, and which has become so much a part of him
        that one has to remind himself that it was assumed, was a
        stroke of genius. It is unique, and sets him in the
        environment and amid the vital circumstances which he, and
        he alone, has brought into literature. In him the
        Mississippi Valley found a reporter entirely and
        instinctively at one with its attitude toward life, its
        bearing in the presence of new conditions, its turn of
        thought and manner of speech. La Salle was the first man to
        make the voyage of the great stream to which a host of
        smaller streams are tributary; but Mark Twain was the first
        man to chart, light, and navigate it for the whole world.
        He has written many books of humorous invention and fresh,
        audacious spirit since the publication of "The Adventures
        of Tom Sawyer," "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," and
        "Life on the Mississippi River," but the heart and soul of
        his work are revealed and preserved in these earlier books,
        and by them he will stand or fall.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; He is the most widely known American
        writer of his time. In the interest and attention of
        foreign readers he ranks with Cooper, Mrs. Stowe, and Poe;
        among Americans none is better known by other peoples save
        Washington, Lincoln, and President Roosevelt. To this host
        of readers beyond the sea and to the host of readers at
        home he is known chiefly as a humorist; but it may be
        suspected that fifty years hence, when his unique
        personality and laughter-provoking manner and mental
        attitude have become traditions, there will emerge a
        reputation based securely on a little group of books which
        many of those who are familiar with his later work have
        never read.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When Mark Twain was born, the first great
        tide of emigration, which had gathered itself in quiet
        places along the Atlantic seaboard, and sent manifold
        streams through the passes of the Alleghanies, and
        fertilized the vast central valley of the continent, had
        touched the edges of the plains; and the man of prophetic
        mind, discerning the significance of its high-water marks,
        might have foreseen the second great wave which, after the
        close of the Civil War, was to sweep from the prairies
        across the Plains to the Pacific and obliterate the Great
        American Desert that stretched, like a vast blight, across
        the old school maps. St. Louis was so small a town that
        Mark Twain has somewhere remarked that he could have bought
        it for a million dollars if he had happened to have the
        money at hand; there were great lonely wastes. which later
        were to be fertile and populous; but when the creator of
        Tom Sawyer was a boy in Hannibal, Missouri, the Mississippi
        Valley was under human control, the river was crowded with
        craft of many kinds, and a unique habit of life had been
        developed along its banks. Of this primitive and powerful
        outgo of human energy and activity the river was both the
        occasion and the shaping force. The majesty of it appealed
        to the earliest voyagers, but its magnitude can only be
        seen by the imagination; for it drains half a continent, is
        fed by fifty-four navigable streams and by several hundred
        more of sufficient depth to float craft of light draught.
        It penetrated and opened up to trade and travel the very
        heart of the continent; it was separated by many days' hard
        travel from the early settlements on the seaboard news of
        the older world was slow in getting to the river
        population, and they were not much influenced by it.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The cry "Westward Ho," heard on the Thames
        in Shakespeare's time, had summoned the adventurous, the
        restless, the lawless, from the older communities north and
        south and sent them into the immense section drained by the
        Mississippi. The East from which they came was still in the
        provincial stage of its growth, with its eyes toward
        Europe; the Southwest that was to be soon detached itself
        from the ideas and interests of the older world and boldly
        gave itself up to the work at hand and to the manner of
        life which its new conditions and tasks rapidly fashioned.
        The earlier immigrants had brought with them a complete
        stock of religious and social standards, which were
        gradually subdued to the new soil; the men of the
        Mississippi Valley were deeply affected by certain
        fundamental ideas of conduct, but they were very little
        embarrassed by external conventions of manner, dress, or
        speech. They developed the primitive virtues of courage,
        resourcefulness, self-reliance, a sense of reality
        impatient of the circumlocutions of formality, a speech
        which gained in vigor and vividness what it lost in breadth
        of expression. Men went straight at the fact, and brushed
        aside everything that hindered the shortest and swiftest
        hitting of the nail on the head. On the river a vast and
        appalling profanity was developed, but it was less a matter
        of conscious irreverence than of surplus imagination and a
        primitive instinct for the picturesque. A few oaths are
        binding, many are loosening; and the profanity of the
        Mississippi Valley was largely "giving the imagination a
        loose." Conditions were hard and work was harder;
        vocabularies were limited and, beyond the demands of
        routine activity, inadequate; exigencies of all kinds
        evoked a variety and force of expression to which the
        resources of profanity were equal. In the Far East cursing
        is a solemn and elaborate ritual of imprecation, casting
        the shadow of a terrible blight on one's remotest ancestors
        and projecting it over one's fathest descendants. It
        shadows one's entire racial career. In the Mississippi
        Valley, on the other hand, cursing was mainly an illicit
        use of picturesque language, or a reckless excursion into
        the realms of humor. Life was essentially fraternal and
        kindly; a broad, genial humor underlay and enfolded it, and
        much of the profanity was fundamentally humorous. Its
        interest lay in the striking effects of broad contrasts; it
        reveled in audacious comparisons, far-fetched similes,
        epithets that overflowed with suggested insult.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The life of the river and of the
        communities that were tributary to it was probably as
        democratic as any the world has known. The squire, who was
        usually of Virginia or Kentucky descent, and was believed
        to be "worth" twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars, but,
        as a matter of courtesy, was credited with the possession
        of fifty thousand, was looked up to in a way, but without a
        particle of subservience. Every other man in the community
        was as good as he, only less fortunate. There was thrift,
        but very little greed; great wealth was unknown, but it was
        easy to make a living. Everybody was religious, but the
        current form of religion, although bristling with
        theoretical difficulties, was of a very comfortable sort
        and full of adaptations to local conditions. In Hannibal,
        when Mark Twain was a boy, the Presbyterians, Baptists, and
        Methodists were, he says, "the three religious disorders."
        He heard Presbyterian preaching for family reasons, but he
        went to the Methodist Sunday-school because "the terms were
        easier." There was a good deal of profanity, drinking, and
        loafing, but the more sophisticated forms of immorality
        were unknown. Certain points of conduct were also points of
        honor; the statute of limitations ran against legal but not
        against moral responsibility for debts; there was a spirit
        of universal kindliness and a charity which enfolded even
        the town drunkard, and treated him not as an outcast but as
        a ward of the community and an illicit local institution.
        He was a weaker brother, whose sins were condoned because
        he belonged to the family. Society in the Mississippi
        Valley in Tom Sawyer's time was a pure democracy, in easy
        circumstances, free from anxiety, charitable of everything
        except cowardice and meanness, taking life comfortably,
        with a broad margin of humor. It was as free from
        introspection as if Puritanism had never brooded over its
        sins and worried about its soul; it was as unconscious of
        traditional standards and classical models as Adam and Eve
        in the Garden of Innocence, and it led a happy-go-lucky
        life with serene trust in the good faith of Providence and
        in the square deal at the hands of the ruler of the
        universe. The light-hearted industry and contagious force
        which mastered the perils of the river and gave it a vast
        neighborliness are thrown into striking relief by the
        somber and sordid temper and the tragic conditions of life
        on the Volga as they have been drawn in black and white by
        Gorky.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of this old-time life under conditions
        which will never be reproduced, Mark Twain was the
        interpreter and recorder, and long after he has ceased to
        be remembered as a fun-maker he will remain the historian
        in a vital dialect of the early Mississippi Valley. . .
        .</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mark Twain is so much a world-figure and
        so entirely the product of the old-time Mississippi Valley
        life, with its vast friendliness and its unconventional
        intimacy, that the extraordinary frankness and detail of
        the autobiography which he is now publishing need not
        disturb the more reticent and circumspect; like those very
        early ancestors of ours whose diaries he has edited, he has
        nothing to conceal or be ashamed of, and the material which
        he is storing up with a prodigal hand will enrich some
        future biographer beyond the dreams of avarice. It is a
        long way from Hannibal, Missouri, to Oxford, from the
        apprentice pilot on a Mississippi steamer to the scarlet
        and gray of the Doctor of Letters of a great and venerable
        university, and the record of it, in its final form, will
        be an American document of high value.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The free, unconventional life of the
        Mississippi Valley of Tom Sawyer's town was an Iliad in
        shirt-sleeves, and there was grave question in the minds of
        some people whether such a stage of society was a proper
        subject for literary presentation; whether it was not too
        rudimentary for art. Mr. Howells, who is a humorist of very
        delicate and charming quality, has described Hannibal,
        Missouri, as "a loafing, out-at-elbows, down-at-heels,
        slave-holding Mississippi town;" and Mark Twain's records
        amply confirm the general accuracy of this description
        loosely applied to a whole section. Mr. James is reported
        as saying that one must be a very rudimentary person to
        enjoy Mark Twain. This is quite true; as true as that one
        must ba a very sophisticated person to enjoy Mr. James.
        Provincialism is not a matter of locality but of attitude,
        and the provincialism of the Boulevard des Italiens is
        quite as pure a product of local ignorance as that of a
        frontier mining town. Extreme sophistication and extreme
        rudimentariness are alike interesting, significant, and
        partial.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In his records of old-time life on the
        greatest of American waterways Mark Twain deals with those
        facts of experience which, stripped of the accidents of
        dress and manners, are the supreme concern of the artist
        because they furnish the richest and most suggestive
        material. Into the unconventional, lawless, devil-may-care
        activity and overflowing high spirits of such a stage of
        development only a boy could enter, and in the stories of
        Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn Mark Twain has penetrated
        to the innermost recesses of that life, and, with its
        crudity, profanity, and reckless indifference to
        conventions, has made us aware of its wholesome courage,
        its gay audacity, its indomitable temper, its contempt for
        artificiality, its superstitions, and its homespun idealism
        of courage, loyalty, and comradeship. Under an immense
        pretension of loafing it was a hard-working life; under an
        aspect of overflowing humor it was in dead earnest. Not
        until one understands that in the Mississippi Valley humor
        was the language of a brave, generous, and laborious people
        can one estimate the work of Mark Twain at its true value;
        not until one recognizes that the author of "Tom Sawyer" is
        a profoundly serious man at heart will he get any real
        insight into his significance as a figure in American
        literature or into his work as a vital contribution to that
        literature.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mark Twain is not a mere fun-maker, like
        Artemus Ward and John Phoenix; he is, in his time and way,
        a true humorist--a man, that is, who sees life, not
        irresponsibly and superficially, but in its broadest and
        most fundamental contrasts. Cervantes, Moliere,
        Shakespeare, and Carlyle were great humorists; Gilbert and
        Sullivan were fun-makers. It was not lack of seriousness
        which made the old-time people of the Mississippi Valley
        humorists; it was ease of spirit, surplusage of
        cheerfulness, a sense of being on good terms with
        Providence in an inexhaustible country, a prevailing
        disposition to put a friendly mask on the face of Fate.
        This is a fundamental attitude toward life, full of
        character, rich in eccentricity of speech and manner,
        redolent of that originality and spontaneity which have
        always been the joy of the great artists. What rich
        adventures of the spirit Shakespeare would have had in the
        Mississippi Valley of Mark Twain's boyhood! . . .</p>
