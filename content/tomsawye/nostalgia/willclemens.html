      <td><i>As far as I know, Will and Samuel Clemens were not
      related, though they did become acquaintances. The 200-page
      biography Will Clemens wrote and published himself may have
      been the earliest full-length study of MT. It was published 1
      July 1892 as "No. 1" in a paperback series called "The
      Pacific Library," price 25&cent;, and did well enough to be
      republished in 1894 by a publisher in Chicago. Throughout the
      book Clemens relies mainly on other writers' previously
      published work. In the excerpt</i> below <i>he borrows the
      unflattering and anti-nostalgic description of Hannibal by
      William Dean Howells, who himself grew up in a
      non-slave-holding small town, to characterize the world of
      MT's childhood.</i></td>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hannibal was a sleepy river town
        characteristic of that day. William Dean Howells, in a
        brief sketch of Mark Twain's career, says: "Hannibal as a
        name is hopelessly confused and ineffective; but if we know
        nothing of Mr. Clemens from Hannibal, we can know much of
        Hannibal from Mr. Clemens, who, in fact, has studied a
        loafing, out-at-elbows, down-at-the-heels, slave-holding,
        Mississippi river town of thirty years ago, with such
        strong reality in his boy's romance of 'Tom Sawyer,' that
        we need inquire nothing further concerning the type. The
        original perhaps no longer exists anywhere, certainly not
        in Hannibal, which has grown into a flourishing little
        city. The morality of the place was the morality of a
        slave-holding community, fierce, arrogant, onesided; the
        religion was Calvinism in various phases, with its
        predestinate aristocracy of saints and its rabble of
        hopeless sinners. Doubtless young Clemens escaped neither
        of the opposing influences wholly. His people, like the
        rest, were slave-holders; but his father, like so many
        other slave-holders, abhorred slavery--silently, as he must
        in such a time and place."</p>
