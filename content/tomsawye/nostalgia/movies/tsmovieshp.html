        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mark Twain's times included the birth of a
        new medium, the movies. He lived long enough to have seen
        the first film version of one of his books, the 1907 <i>Tom
        Sawyer</i>. Given his fascination with new inventions, he
        might have wanted to see this adaptation, but there is no
        record of his having done so.<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; In the century since, <i>Tom Sawyer</i> has
        been the most frequently filmed of MT's books. It was
        filmed three times before <i>Huck Finn</i> was filmed at
        all, and Tom himself was the star of the second movie
        version of Huck's story (<i>see below</i>). The next
        century might tell a different story. Based on my students' testimony, <i>The Adventures of
        Tom Sawyer</i> is still read, but it seems safe to say that most Americans born since 1975 mainly
        know Tom through Huck's novel, and know the plot of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> mostly through the more recent films
        on the list below. In another generation it might be
        time for <i>Tom</i> to say, "You don't know about me except
        you have read a book by the name of 'Huckleberry
        Finn.'"<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike the film versions of Huck's story, the
        movies made from Tom's adventures stick pretty closely to
        the plot of MT's original text. Even the most recent
        version, for example, still identifies its villain as
        "Injun Joe." No film attempts to incorporate the overt
        nostalgia of the novel's backward-looking narrator, but all
        treat both boyhood and the American past as
        playgrounds.<br /></p>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; Like about 90% of the early silent movies, this
      first film adaptation of <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>
      seems to be lost. The very brief entry on it in the Internet
      Movie Data Base contains only two names, under "Writing
      Credits" -- Gene Gauntier and Mark Twain.<br /></td>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; A decade later William Desmond Taylor directed two film adaptations of MT's novel, both produced by the Famous Players Picture Corporation and distributed by Paramount.  Julia Crawford Ivers' script for <i>Tom Sawyer</i> (1917) derives mainly from chapters 1 - 6 and 13 - 17 of the text.  Jack Pickford, Mary's younger brother, played Tom, Clara Horton played Becky, and Robert Gordon played Huck.<br /><br />

     &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Tom Sawyer</i> was followed up a year later by <i>Huck and Tom, or The Further Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> (1918), also for Famous Players and Paramount and with the same cast.  This time Ivers' script focused more on the episodes that feature the two boys -- from the murder in the graveyard through the discovery of the treasure -- but as you can see from the poster <i>below left</i>, it still emphasized Tom's relationship with Becky.  (In 1920 Taylor directed a different cast in the Famous Players' production of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>.)<br /><br />

      &nbsp; &nbsp; The first sound adaptation of MT's novel was
      made in 1930 by Paramount, and featured Jackie Coogan (whom
      Chaplin had made a star at age 7 in <i>The Kid</i> [1921]) as
      Tom. Huck was played by Junior Durkin, Becky by Mitzi Green,
      and Sid by Jackie Searl. Clara Blandick, who would be better
      known for an Auntie named Em in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
      (1939) played Aunt Polly. In the second still photo
      <i>below</i>, Charlie Stevens is playing Joe and Tully Marshall is Muff Potter (the actor who played Dr. Robinson was uncredited):<br clear="left" />

      &nbsp; &nbsp; "I did wish Tom Sawyer was here," Huck says in
      the novel he narrates. Early Hollywood seems to have been
      felt the same way (at least when box-office star Jackie
      Coogan played him). After Paramount's success with <i>Tom
      Sawyer</i> in 1930, the studio hired Norman Taurog to direct
      a new version of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. Released in 1931,
      it again starred Jackie Coogan, Junior Durkin, Mitzi Green
      and (again as Sid) Jackie Searl. That's them you see <i>at
      left</i>. Despite Jim's absence from the poster, the film
      does follow his and Huck's misadventures on the raft --
      though as you can see from the following publicity stills,
      Tom comes along with them for the ride:<br />

      &nbsp; &nbsp; A year before he made <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, David O. Selznick
      went back to ante bellum Missouri with his version of <i>The
      Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> (1938). Directed by Norman
      Taurog, who had done <i>Huck Finn</i> for Paramount in 1931
      and who also directed <i>Boys Town</i> with Mickey Rooney and
      Spencer Tracy in 1938, the film starred Tommy Kelly as Tom,
      Jackie Moran as Huck, Ann Gillis as Becky Thatcher, May
      Robson as Aunt Polly, Philip Hurlic as "Little Jim" and gets
      memorable performances from Walter Brennan as Muff Potter and
      Victor Jory as Injun Joe.<br clear="left" />

      &nbsp; &nbsp; MT wrote <i>Tom Sawyer, Detective</i> along
      with <i>Tom Sawyer Abroad</i> in the mid-1890s, two decades
      after Tom's first novel appeared. At the time he was more
      desperate for money than at any other point in his career,
      and seems mainly to have been trying to cash in on the
      established marketability of Tom's name. Presumbably Adolph
      Zukor had much the same motive when he produced this film for
      Paramount at the same time that Selznick was making his film.
      The cover of the film's publicity book (<i>left</i>) shows a
      young Donald O'Connor, who actually played Huck. Huck and Tom both appear in the two posters <i>below</i>.

      &nbsp; &nbsp; This 1973 musical adaption was Reader's
      Digest's first venture into movie-making. It starred Johnny
      Whitaker as Tom, Jeff East as Huck and Jodie Foster as Becky.
      The score (by Richard Sherman, Robert Sherman and John
      Williams) received both Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.
      Reader's Digest used Jeff East again when it brought out a
      musical version of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> in 1974, though
      Tom's character doesn't appear in this sequel.</td>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; Jonathan Taylor Thomas was a 14-year-old TV
        star when Walt Disney Pictures hired him to play Tom;
        13-year-old Brad Renfro was making his third movie in a
        year and a half. Disney released this 1995 movie under two
        other names as well: <i>The Adventures of Tom and Huck</i>
        and just plain <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, but it was best known by
        the name <i>Tom and Huck</i>. On the one hand, that title
        suggests how well known the pair was by the end of the last
        century. On the other, since the movie's plot derives
        exclusively from Tom's novel, not Huck's, the prominent use
        of Huck's name suggests there may have been concern about
        whether Tom's name by itself would draw enough attention
        and customers to the film. In MT's novel, we learn that Tom
        "did not care to have Huck's company in public places." Now
        he seems to need it to keep his own place in the public's
        mind. When Disney brought out <i>The Adventures of Huck
        Finn</i> in 1993, Tom's character was left out
        entirely.<br />
