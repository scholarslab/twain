        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tune in Radio Station WOS, the State
        Marketing Bureau at Jefferson City, on the evening of
        January 28th, a program will be broadcast by remote
        control, telling the world about Northeast Missouri by The
        Hannibal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Last year a similar program was broadcast
        through the same plan and response cards, letters,
        telegrams and phone calls came from every nook and corner
        of the United States and Canada. More than 4,000 radio fans
        acknowledged the reception of the program. The Hannibal
        Chamber of Commerce has again laid greater plans for their
        broadcast this year which is the occasion of the
        organization's Seventeenth Annual Banquet. Efforts are
        being made to re-broadcast</p>

      <td width="50%" valign="top">
        <p>through WOS to a large eastern station, which will send
        the story of Hannibal to all parts of the world.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An interesting feature on the program that
        all Northeast Missourians will want to hear is the voice of
        the only living character of Mark Twain's stories. Mrs.
        Laura Frazier, the original Becky Thatcher, will tell you
        about Tom Sawyer and his gang, as she knew them.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The program will be of a Mark Twain
        nature. We are informed that an appropriate souvenir will
        be sent to the first thousand acknowledgments. Copies of
        Mark Twain's books will be given as special prizes, so get
        the old set in good shape, you'll never regret the time you
        spend listening to what Hannibal and her famous characters
        have to say on the evening of Thursday, January 28th.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There will be music, speaking by a
        personage of national prominence.</p>
