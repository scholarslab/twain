          <p>The name of Mark Twain is known throughout the length
          and breadth of England. Wherever there is a
          railway-station with a bookstall his jokes are household
          words. Those whose usual range in literature does not
          extend beyond the sporting newspapers, the <i>Racing
          Calendar,</i> and the "Diseases of Dogs," have allowed
          him a place with Artemus Ward alongside of the handful of
          books which forms their library. For ourselves, we cannot
          dissociate him from the railway-station, and his jokes
          always rise in our mind with a background of Brown &amp;
          Polson's Corn Flour and Taylor's system of removing
          furniture. We have read <i>The Adventures of Tom
          Sawyer</i> with different surroundings, and still have
          been made to laugh; and that ought to be taken as high
          praise. Indeed, the earlier part of the book is, to our
          thinking, the most amusing thing Mark Twain has written.
          The humour is not always uproarious, but it is always
          genuine and sometimes almost pathetic, and it is only now
          and then that the heartiness of a laugh is spoilt by one
          of those pieces of self-consciousness which are such
          common blots on Mark Twain's other books. <i>The
          Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> is an attempt in a new
          direction. It is consecutive, and much longer than the
          former books, and as it is not put forward as a mere
          collection of <i>Screamers,</i> we laugh more easily, and
          find some relief in being able to relax the conventional
          grin expected from the reader of the little volumes of
          railway humour. The present book is not, and does not
          pretend to be a novel, in the ordinary sense of the word;
          it is not even a story, for that presupposes a climax and
          a finish; nor is it a mere boys' book of adventures. In
          the Preface the author says, "Although my book is
          intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls,
          I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that
          account, for part of my plan has been to try pleasantly
          to remind adults of what they once were themselves, and
          of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer
          enterprises they sometimes engaged in." Questions of
          intention are always difficult to decide. The book will
          amuse grown-up people in the way that humorous books
          written for children have amused before, but (perhaps
          fortunately) it does not seem to us calculated to carry
          out the intention here expressed. With regard to the
          style, of course there are plenty of slang words and racy
          expressions, which are quite in place in the
          conversations, but it is just a question whether it would
          not have been as well if the remainder of the book had
          not been written more uniformly in English.</p>
