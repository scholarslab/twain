  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 21</h3>

  <p>Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the
  "interesting" paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and
  read a "poem." Two stanzas of it will do:</p>

  <p>"<br /></p>

  <h2>A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA</h2>"Alabama,
  good-bye! I love thee well!<br />
  But yet for a while do I leave thee now!<br />
  Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,<br />
  And burning recollections throng my brow!<br />
  For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;<br />
  Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;<br />
  Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,<br />
  And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.<br />
  <br />
  "Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,<br />
  Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;<br />
  'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,<br />
  'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.<br />
  Welcome and home were mine within this State,<br />
  Whose vales I leave -- whose spires fade fast from me<br />
  And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,<br />
  When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!"<br />
  "<br />

  <p>There were very few there who knew what <i>"tete"</i></p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 208</tt><br />
  meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.

  <p>Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired
  young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic
  expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:</p>

  <p>"<br /></p>

  <h2>A VISION</h2>

  <p>"Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not
  a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy
  thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific
  lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of
  heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the
  illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came
  forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to
  enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene. "</p>

  <p>"At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my
  very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,</p>

  <p>"My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide
  --</p>

  <p>My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my side. She
  moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks
  of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty
  unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was
  her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical
  thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive
  beauties, she would have glided away un-perceived -- unsought. A
  strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the
  robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements
  without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented." "</p>

  <p>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound
  up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians
  that it took the first prize. This composition was considered to
  be the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the
  village, in delivering the prize to the author of it,</p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 209</tt><br />
  made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most
  "eloquent" thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster
  himself might well be proud of it.
