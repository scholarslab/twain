          <p>Mark Twain belongs to a somewhat different school of
          writers from Miss Yonge, and <i>Tom Sawyer</i> is a
          characteristic production of his genius. We recognize the
          germ of it in the stories of the good and bad little
          boys, which went some way towards making their author's
          popularity. <i>Tom Sawyer,</i> as we are told in the
          Preface, is intended primarily for the amusement of
          children, but it is hoped that "it will not be shunned by
          men and women on that account, for part of my plan has
          been to try pleasantly to remind adults of what they once
          were themselves." How far Master Sawyer's eccentric
          experiences may come home in that way to American
          citizens we cannot pretend to say. To our English
          notions, Tom appears to have been a portentous
          phenomenon, and his eventful career exhibits an
          unprecedented precocity. His conceptions were as romantic
          as their execution was audacious. Holding all sedentary
          occupations in aversion, his cast of thought was as
          original as his quaint felicity of picturesque
          expression. We are very sure there are no such boys in
          this country, and even in the States it may be supposed
          that the breed has been dying out, for fully more than a
          generation has gone by since Tom was the glory and plague
          of his native village on the Mississippi. His remarkable
          talent for mischief would have made him an intolerable
          thorn in the flesh of the aunt who acted as a mother to
          him had it not been that his pranks and misconduct
          endeared him to that much-enduring woman. "Cuteness" is
          scarcely the word for Tom's ingrained artfulness. Take,
          by way of example, one of his earliest achievements. He
          is caught by his aunt in some flagrant delict, and
          condemned to whitewash the fence that runs in front of
          her cottage. Tom had planned to make one of a swimming
          party, and, what is more, he knows that he will be jeered
          by his playmates, and contempt is intolerable to his
          soaring spirit. So, when he sees Ben Rogers, whose satire
          he stands most in dread of, come puffing along the road,
          personating a high-pressure steamer, Tom buckles himself
          to his task with a will. He is so absorbed, in fact, in
          artistic enthusiasm that Ben's ribald mockery falls on
          unheeding ears, and Tom has actually to be twitched by
          the jacket before he turns to recognize his friend. Ere
          long Ben, who was bound for the river, is begging and
          praying to be permitted to have a turn with the brush.
          Tom is slow to be persuaded; had it been the back fence
          it might have been different, but his aunt is awful
          particular about this front one --</p>

          <p>"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly --
          well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him. Sid
          wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let Sid. Now, don't you
          see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and
          anything was to happen to it."</p>

          <p>The result is that Tom, as an immense favour, trades
          the privilege of a few minutes' painting for an apple.
          Each of the other boys, as he comes up in Ben's wake,
          makes a similar deal on his own account. Tom amasses a
          wealth of miscellaneous treasure, which he subsequently
          barters for a sufficiency of tickets of merit at the
          Sunday school to entitle him to walk off with the honours
          for which meritorious children have been toiling; while
          his aunt, to her intense surprise, finds her fence
          covered with several coatings of whitewash, and goes into
          raptures over Tom's capacity for work on the rare
          occasions when he chooses to apply himself. But, though
          anything but a bookish boy, Tom had paid considerable
          attention to literature of an eccentric kind, and,
          indeed, his knowledge of men and things was very much
          taken from his favourite authors. He runs away with a
          couple of comrades to follow the calling of pirates on an
          island of the Mississippi, the grand inducement being
          "that you don't have to get up mornings, and you don't
          have to go to school and wash and all that blame
          foolishness." After some days, when the trio are bored
          and half-starved and rather frightened, Tom plans a
          melo-dramatic return, and the missing ones emerge from
          the disused gallery of the church and present themselves
          to the congregation of weeping mourners, just as the
          clergyman's moving eloquence is dwelling on the virtues
          of the dear departed. Afterwards Tom, who "all along has
          been wanting to be a robber," but has never been able to
          find the indispensable cave, stumbles on the very thing
          to suit him. So he carries off a devoted follower who has
          been hardened for an outlaw's life by the habit of living
          on scraps and sleeping in empty hogsheads -- Republican
          freedom from class prejudices seems to have been a marked
          feature among the boys of the Transatlantic St.
          Petersburg. He teaches Huck his duties as they are flying
          from the society of their kind out of the accumulated
          stores of his own erudition. "Who'll we rob?" asks Huck.
          "Oh, most anybody -- waylay people; that's mostly the
          way." "And kill them?" "No, not always. Hide them in the
          cave till they can raise a ransom. You make them raise
          all they can off o' their friends, and after you've kept
          them a year, if it ain't raised, then you kill them.
          That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women;
          you shut up the women, but you don't kill them. They're
          always beautiful and rich and awfully scared. You take
          their watches and things, but you always take off your
          hat and talk polite. There ain't everybody as polite as
          robbers; you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get
          to loving you; and after they've been in the cave a week
          or two weeks they stop crying, and after that you
          couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd
          turn right round and come back. It's so in all the
          books.' In the course of their researches in the cavern
          they come on what Tom pronounces "an awful snug place for
          orgies." "What's orgies?" inquires Huck. "I dunno," says
          Tom very frankly; "but robbers always have orgies, and of
          course we've got to have them too."</p>

          <p>We fear these elegant extracts give but a faint idea
          of the drollery in which the book abounds; for the fact
          is that the best part of the fun lies in the ludicrous
          individuality of Tom himself, with whom we have been
          gradually growing familiar. But we should say that a
          perusal of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> is as fair a test as one
          could suggest of anybody's appreciation of the humorous.
          The drollery is often grotesque and extravagant, and
          there is at least as much in the queer Americanizing of
          the language as in the ideas it expresses. Practical
          people who pride themselves on strong common sense will
          have no patience with such vulgar trifling. But those who
          are alive to the pleasure of relaxing from serious
          thought and grave occupation will catch themselves
          smiling over every page and exploding outright over some
          of the choicer passages.</p>
