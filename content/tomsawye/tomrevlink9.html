  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 6</h3>

  <p>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village,
  Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was
  cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town,
  because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad -- and because
  all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden
  society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the
  rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry
  his</p>

  gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play
  with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
  Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of
  full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering
  with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped
  out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his
  heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one
  suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged
  low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt
  when not rolled up.

  <p>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on
  doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did
  not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master
  or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where
  he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him
  to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always
  the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to
  resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on
  clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
  that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every
  harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p>
