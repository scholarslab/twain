          <p>Mr. Aldrich has studied the life of A Bad Boy as the
          pleasant reprobate led it in a quiet old New England town
          twenty-five or thirty years ago, where in spite of the
          natural outlawry of boyhood he was more or less part of a
          settled order of things, and was hemmed in, to some
          measure, by the traditions of an established
          civilization. Mr. Clemens, on the contrary, has taken the
          boy of the Southwest for the hero of his new book, and
          has presented him with a fidelity to circumstance which
          loses no charm by being realistic in the highest degree,
          and which gives incomparably the best picture of life in
          that region as yet known to fiction. The town where Tom
          Sawyer was born and brought up is some such idle, shabby
          little Mississippi River town as Mr. Clemens has so well
          described in his piloting reminiscences, but Tom belongs
          to the better sort of people in it, and has been bred to
          fear God and dread the Sunday-school according to the
          strictest rite of the faiths that have characterized all
          the respectability of the West. His subjection in these
          respects does not so deeply affect his inherent
          tendencies but that he makes himself a beloved burden to
          the poor, tender-hearted old aunt who brings him up with
          his orphan brother and sister, and struggles vainly with
          his manifold sins, actual and imaginary. The limitations
          of his transgressions are nicely and artistically traced.
          He is mischievous, but not vicious; he is ready for
          almost any depredation that involves the danger and honor
          of adventure, but profanity he knows may provoke a
          thunderbolt upon the heart of the blasphemer, and he
          almost never swears; he resorts to any stratagem to keep
          out of school, but he is not a downright liar, except
          upon terms of after shame and remorse that make his
          falsehood bitter to him. He is cruel, as all children
          are, but chiefly because he is ignorant; he is not mean,
          but there are very definite bounds to his generosity; and
          his courage is the Indian sort, full of prudence and
          mindful of retreat as one of the conditions of prolonged
          hostilities. In a word, he is a boy, and merely and
          exactly an ordinary boy on the moral side. What makes him
          delightful to the reader is that on the imaginative side
          he is very much more, and though every boy has wild and
          fantastic dreams, this boy cannot rest till he has
          somehow realized them. Till he has actually run off with
          two other boys in the character of buccaneer, and lived
          for a week on an island in the Mississippi, he has lived
          in vain; and this passage is but the prelude to more
          thrilling adventures, in which he finds hidden treasures,
          traces the bandits to their cave, and is himself lost in
          its recesses. The local material and the incidents with
          which his career is worked up are excellent, and
          throughout there is scrupulous regard for the boy's point
          of view in reference to his surroundings and himself,
          which shows how rapidly Mr. Clemens has grown as an
          artist. We do not remember anything in which this
          propriety is violated, and its preservation adds
          immensely to the grown-up reader's satisfaction in the
          amusing and exciting story. There is a boy's love-affair,
          but it is never treated otherwise than as a boy's
          love-affair. When the half-breed has murdered the young
          doctor, Tom and his friend, Huckleberry Finn, are really,
          in their boyish terror and superstition, going to let the
          poor old town-drunkard be hanged for the crime, till the
          terror of that becomes unendurable. The story is a
          wonderful study of the boy-mind, which inhabits a world
          quite distinct from that in which he is bodily present
          with his elders, and in this lies its great charm and its
          universality, for boy-nature, however human nature
          varies, is the same everywhere.</p>

          <p>The tale is very dramatically wrought, and the
          subordinate characters are treated with the same graphic
          force that sets Tom alive before us. The worthless
          vagabond, Huck Finn, is entirely delightful throughout,
          and in his promised reform his identity is respected: he
          will lead a decent life in order that he may one day be
          thought worthy to become a member of that gang of robbers
          which Tom is to organize. Tom's aunt is excellent, with
          her kind heart's sorrow and secret pride in Tom; and so
          is his sister Mary, one of those good girls who are born
          to usefulness and charity and forbearance and unvarying
          rectitude. Many village people and local notables are
          introduced in well-conceived character; the whole little
          town lives in the reader's sense, with its religiousness,
          its lawlessness, its droll social distinctions, its
          civilization qualified by its slave-holding, and its
          traditions of the wilder West which has passed away. The
          picture will be instructive to those who have fancied the
          whole Southwest a sort of vast Pike County, and have not
          conceived of a sober and serious and orderly contrast to
          the sort of life that has come to represent the Southwest
          in literature. Mr. William M. Baker gives a notion of
          this in his stories, and Mr. Clemens has again enforced
          the fact here, in a book full of entertaining character,
          and of the greatest artistic sincerity.</p>

          <p>Tom Brown and Tom Bailey are, among boys in books,
          alone deserving to be named with Tom Sawyer.</p>
