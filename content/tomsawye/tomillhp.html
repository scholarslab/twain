        <p>Whether or not they've ever read MT's novel, most
        Americans already have some idea of what "Tom Sawyer" looks
        like. From the work of numerous artists, film makers,
        cartoonists, advertising designers and so on, images of
        playing hookey or whitewashing the fence or getting lost in
        the cave have become parts of our cultural consciousness.
        In MT's time, people "saw" Tom and the story as True
        Williams depicted them. Williams, who had worked on each of
        the MT books previously published by the American
        Publishing Company, did 160 of the novel's 162
        illustrations.</p><img src="tschap29.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" alt ="PAGE: ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER" />

        <p>The manuscript was short, especially for a subscription
        book; both the publisher and the author were probably
        counting on Williams' drawings to make <i>Tom</i> look
        bulkier. Beverly R. David suggests that that may account
        for the unusual design Williams created for the novel's 35
        chapter headings: "these head pieces occupied from fifty to
        sixty per cent of the total page space." These designs are
        the most attractive feature of Williams' contribution to
        the volume, although they caused a difficulty in setting
        type that helped delay its publication.</p>

        <p>MT was happy with Williams' "rattling pictures," as he
        called them in a letter to Howells dated 18 January 1876,
        where he spoke feelingly of the illustrator: "Poor devil,
        what a genius he has &amp; how he does murder it with rum.
        He takes a book of mine, &amp; without suggestion from
        anybody builds no end of pictures just from his reading of
        it."</p>

        <p><a name="i" id="i">One picture</a> not by Williams was
        doubtless the result of a suggestion from MT. At the very
        end of the narrative is what looks to be a drawing of Aunt
        Polly -- except that it is actually of "Mrs. Partington," a
        character created in the 1850's by humorist Benjamin
        Shillaber. As Sinclair Hamilton has shown, the drawing can
        be traced back to an artist named Josiah Wolcott; this
        version of Mrs. Partington, though, was the work of
        Frederick M. Coffin, and was used as the frontispiece to
        Shillaber's 1854 <i>Life and Sayings of Mrs.
        Partington</i>. Books published by Elisha Bliss frequently
        recycled illustrations from other American Publishing Co.
        books to save money, but in this case it took additional
        effort to make this visual quotation to Shillaber's
        well-known book. Why MT chose to end his novel with this
        gesture isn't clear, but it might have been meant to
        indicate the debt Aunt Polly and Tom owe to Mrs. Partington
        and her nephew Ike (see <a href=
        "tomsrcs.html">Sources</a>). Below are both drawings: on
        the left the first page of Shillaber's volume; on the
        right, the penultimate page of MT's:</p>

          "tommrsp1.jpg" alt =" MRS PARTINGTON" /></a>&#x00A0;<a href=
          "javascript:Start('tomauntp.html')"><img src=
          "auntp.jpg" alt ="AUNT POLLY" /></a>
        </center>

        <p>The only other drawing not by Williams is supposed to be
        by Tom Sawyer: the house he draws for Becky. Most
        commentators think MT drew this picture himself (see
        <a href="../sc_as_mt/househp.html">The Big House</a>).</p>

        <p>Here are 12 examples of Williams' work. Many others can
        be seen, embedded in the pages of the first edition, by
        looking through <a href="tomdumhp.html">the Prospectus</a>
        for the novel.</p>
