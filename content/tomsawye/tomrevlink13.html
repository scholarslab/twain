  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 2</h3>

  <p>"Hi- <i>yi</i> ! <i>You're</i> up a stump, ain't you!"</p>

  <p>No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an
  artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed
  the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's
  mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben
  said:</p>

  <p>"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?"</p>

  <p>Tom wheeled suddenly and said:</p>

  <p>"Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing."</p>

  <p>"Say -- <i>I'm</i> going in a-swimming, <i>I</i> am. Don't you
  wish you could? But of course you'd druther <i>work</i> --
  wouldn't you? Course you would!"</p>

  <p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:</p>

  <p>"What do you call work?"</p>

  <p>"Why, ain't <i>that</i> work?"</p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 31</tt><br />

  <p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it
  suits Tom Sawyer."</p>

  <p>"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you <i>like</i>
  it?"</p>

  <p>The brush continued to move.</p>

  <p>"Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a
  boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"</p>

  <p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his
  apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth -- stepped
  back to note the effect -- added a touch here and there --
  criticised the effect again -- Ben watching every move and
  getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed.
  Presently he said:</p>

  <p>"Say, Tom, let <i>me</i> whitewash a little."</p>

  <p>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his
  mind:</p>

  <p>"No -- no -- I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see,
  Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence -- right here on
  the street, you know -- but if it was the back fence I wouldn't
  mind and <i>she</i> wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about
  this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there
  ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
  the way it's got to be done."</p>

  <p>"No -- is that so? Oh come, now -- lemme</p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 32</tt><br />
  just try. Only just a little -- I'd let <i>you</i> , if you was
  me, Tom."

  <p>"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly -- well, Jim
  wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it,
  and she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you
  was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it --
  "</p>

  <p>"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say --
  I'll give you the core of my apple."</p>

  <p>"Well, here -- No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard -- "</p>

  <p>"I'll give you <i>all</i> of it!"</p>

  <p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but
  alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri
  worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel
  in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and
  planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of
  material; boys happened along every little while; they came to
  jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out,
  Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in
  good repair; and when <i>he</i> played out, Johnny Miller bought
  in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with -- and so on, and
  so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon
  came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom
  was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before
  mentioned, twelve marbles,</p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 33</tt><br />
  part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look
  through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a
  fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier,
  a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one
  eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar -- but no dog -- the handle
  of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old
  window sash.

  <p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while -- plenty of
  company -- and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If
  he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy
  in the village.</p>

  <p>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after
  all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without
  knowing it -- namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet
  a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to
  attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the
  writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work
  consists of whatever a body is <i>obliged</i> to do, and that
  Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this
  would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers
  or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or
  climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy
  gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches
  twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because
  the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were</p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 34</tt><br />
  offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and
  then they would resign.

  <p>The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had
  taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward
  headquarters to report.</p>
