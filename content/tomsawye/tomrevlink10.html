  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 33</h3>

  <p>The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near
  at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground
  for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead.
  The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had
  placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch
  the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the
  dreary regularity of a clock-tick -- a dessertspoonful once in
  four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids
  were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid
  when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created<br />
  <tt>Page 303</tt><br />
  the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at
  Lexington was "news." It is falling now; it will still be falling
  when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of
  history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in
  the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a
  mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years
  to be ready for this flitting human insect's need? and has it
  another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to
  come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless
  half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops,
  but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone
  and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of
  McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of the
  cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it.</p>
