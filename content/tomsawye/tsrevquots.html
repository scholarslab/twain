    <a name="a" id="a">The</a> poor unfortunate had starved to
    death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly
    growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip
    from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the
    stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he
    had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that
    fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of
    a clock-tick -- a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty
    hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when
    Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid when Christ
    was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire;
    when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
    "news." It is falling now; it will still be falling when all
    these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and
    the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick
    night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did
    this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready
    for this flitting human insect's need? and has it another
    important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No
    matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed
    scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this
    day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that
    slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of
    McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of
    the cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it.

    <a name="b" id="b">The minister</a> gave out the hymn, and read
    it through with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much
    admired in that part of the country. His voice began on a
    medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain
    point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
    and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:<br />

    <blockquote>
      Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry beds of
      ease,<br />
      Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' blood-y
      seas?
    </blockquote>
    &#x00A0; &#x00A0; He was regarded as a wonderful
    reader. At church "sociables" he was always called upon to read
    poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their
    hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and "wall"
    their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, "Words
    cannot express it; it is too beautiful, too beautiful for this
    mortal earth."<br />
    &#x00A0; &#x00A0; <a name="d" id="d">After the hymn</a> had been
    sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a
    bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings and
    societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch
    out to the crack of doom -- a queer custom which is still kept
    up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of
    abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a
    traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.<br />
    &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And now the minister prayed. A good, generous
    prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the
    church, and the little children of the church; for the other
    churches of the village; for the village itself; for the
    county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
    States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress;
    for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor
    sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions
    groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental
    despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings,
    and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the
    heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a
    supplication that the words he was about to speak might find
    grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground,
    yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen.<br />
    &#x00A0; &#x00A0; There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing
    congregation sat down. <a name="e" id="e">The boy</a> whose
    history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only
    endured it -- if he even did that much. He was restive all
    through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer,
    unconsciously -- for he was not listening, but he knew the
    ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it -- and
    when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear
    detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
    additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a
    fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured
    his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its
    head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it
    seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender
    thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with
    its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had
    been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly
    as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as
    sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare
    -- he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did
    such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the
    closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and
    the instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner of war.
    His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.<br />
    &#x00A0; &#x00A0; The minister gave out his text and droned along
    monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a
    head by and by began to nod -- and yet it was an argument that
    dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the
    predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
    worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after
    church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he
    seldom knew anything else about the discourse. However, this
    time he was really interested for a little while. The minister
    made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of
    the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb
    should lie down together and a little child should lead them.
    But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle
    were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness
    of the principal character before the on-looking nations; his
    face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he
    wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.

    <a name="c" id="c">If he had</a> been a great and wise
    philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
    comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is
    <i>obliged</i> to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body
    is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why
    constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill
    is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only
    amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive
    four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily
    line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them
    considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the
    service, that would turn it into work and then they would
    resign.

    <a name="f" id="f">The petition</a> had been largely signed;
    many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a
    committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning
    and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful
    ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to
    have killed five citizens of the village, but what of that? If
    he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of
    weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition,
    and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky
    water-works.

    <a name="h" id="h">Mr. Walters</a> fell to "showing off," with
    all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders,
    delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there,
    everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian "showed
    off" -- running hither and thither with his arms full of books
    and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect
    authority delights in. The young lady teachers "showed off" --
    bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed,
    lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting
    good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers "showed off"
    with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and
    fine attention to discipline -- and most of the teachers, of
    both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit;
    and it was business that frequently had to be done over again
    two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little
    girls "showed off" in various ways, and the little boys "showed
    off" with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads
    and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man
    sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house,
    and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur -- for he was
    "showing off," too.
