        <p>London, June 10, 1876.--Next week all England will be
        enjoying a new story by Mark Twain, with a piquant sauce
        supplied by the novelty of reading it before the Centennial
        land. Carlyle told me that the first bound book of his he
        ever saw came to him by mail from New England, and
        presently Mark Twain may say that the last bound book of
        his was sent him from Old England. By what means it happens
        that we are to have "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" before
        you I cannot tell; all I know is that, through the kindness
        of Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus, who are its publishers, by
        special arrangement with the author, I have before me early
        sheets of this story, and have good reason to believe that
        some notes concerning it will be "news" to the author's
        countrymen.</p>

        <p>It is, as I think, the most notable work which Mark
        Twain has yet written, and will signally add to his
        reputation for variety of powers. His <i>dramatis
        personae</i> are mainly some boys and girls residing in the
        magnificently small village of St. Petersburg, somewhere on
        the Missouri, the Czar of which village is Tom Sawyer, who
        settled his western questions more satisfactorily, I
        suspect, than the chief of the larger St. Petersburg is
        likely to settle in his Eastern one. Under pretext of this
        boy-and-girl's romance, Mark Twain has written a book which
        will not only charm elder readers--especially if they have
        that age which, as the Book of Wisdom says, "consisteth not
        in length of years, but in having made the most of
        them"--but will be of value to philosophers. I shouldn't
        wonder if Mr. Edward Tylor, in his next book on human
        evolution--and we are looking for one--should find reason
        to refer to the survivals of ancient Oriental and Greek
        myths and beliefs in the elaborate folklore of Tom Sawyer
        and his comrades. Heine, in his "Exiled Gods," has traced a
        classic legend of some magnificent deity--Apollo, I
        believe--until he finds it interesting as an anecdote
        [about] an old miller in a German parish; and I think it
        would not be difficult to trace some of the attributes of
        Siva and Odin, and perhaps the Eleusynian rites, in the
        notions of these children about their village witch, and
        the power of a dead cat thrown in a graveyard with precise
        rules, to remove warts, and sundry other superstitions. No
        doubt most of us remember such things in our early
        life--especially if we were born in remote southern or
        western villages, where the Semitic had not, as in New
        England, trampled out the Indo-Germanic varieties of
        superstition; but it was a "happy thought" in Mark Twain to
        recover them and twine them in with his story. It is a
        valuable bit of social embryology, for instance, when we
        find that those barefoot western boys, who know nothing of
        Catholicism, have somehow got the belief that the devil
        can't get at them if a cross is near by; and it reminds us
        of the fact that in the country districts of Europe the
        most determined Lutheran, if he thinks himself bewitched,
        will repair to the Catholic priest for the exorcism, and
        never to his Protestant pastor.</p>

        <p>However, this is but a small part, however valuable to
        certain minds, of the interest of this work. Incidental,
        also--but very striking--are the indications in it of how,
        amid all the spars and fragments of a past that has gone to
        pieces and been washed up on the beach of a new moral
        continent, new tendencies are seen forming, and new themes,
        which are still harmonious with what is eternal in human
        nature. Children report the past and foreshadow the future.
        Here in England the boy repeats the history of his
        ancestors,--aye, and the girl, too. The boy is a savage,
        and then a Viking and a pirate in his tastes, a nomad in
        his love adventure, and passing through the age of the
        huntsman, affects agriculture and mechanic art for a time,
        becomes a knight errant, and so advances to be an
        Englishman. These embryological states of development are
        very marked at some points. Thus there is a phase in the
        life of English children of both sexes--and a phase which
        lasts inconveniently long--when they madly desire to run
        about in the garden naked. It requires the utmost vigilance
        to prevent them from doing this in the little gardens of
        London. Many a boy and girl here will feel an agony of envy
        when they contemplate the scene of Mark Twain's three boys
        painted with mud to look like Indians racing up and down
        the beach to their heart's content. Many other scenes and
        notions, too, will correspond to the familiar feelings of
        the healthy British boy and girl. But now and then they
        will pause with some wonder, and it will be at some point
        where the village of Missouri has unfolded some
        unprescribed tendency in human nature or, perhaps,
        recovering one that was lost. It will introduce a novel
        ethical problem in the young circles of England when they
        read about Tom Sawyer's lie. Tom has been deeply offended
        by a little girl whom he had adored. She was soon after in
        great trouble, having torn a valuable book belonging to the
        teacher while surreptitiously examining it at his desk. The
        teacher is going down from boy to boy and girl to girl,
        switch in hand, asking each if he or she had done the
        dreadful deed. The guilty, terrified girl is reached at
        last, and the fearful question is being asked: "Becky
        Thatcher, did you--." Just here a boy's voice sounded
        through the breathless school. "I done it." It was Tom; he
        took his unmerciful flogging. The girl's father, when he
        heard of this long after, declared "it was a noble, a
        generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that was worthy to hold
        up its head and march down through history breast to breast
        with George Washington's lauded truth about the hatchet."
        Besides this perilous accident, there is an interest of an
        equally doubtful kind surrounding a unique and vigorously
        drawn character called Huckleberry Finn, the juvenile
        Pariah of the village, son of the town drunkard thus
        <a name="a" id="a">described:</a><br />
        <br /></p>

        </center><br />
        <br />

        <p>Huckleberry comes into fortune at last, or what
        respectable people think fortune, and is taken into a
        respectable home by kind people, who try to educate and
        civilize him, but he finds it irksome, cannot bear it,
        disappears, and is found afterward sleeping in such
        quarters as tradition assigns to Diogenes, and begging Tom
        to take the wealth that has befallen him and allow him to
        continue in his old felicity of vagabondage.</p>

        <p>There is in this work more that is dramatic than in any
        of Mark Twain's previous works, and some scenes that are
        impressive, and even weird., There is a thrilling murder-
        scene, a graphic trial-scene, and a solemn
        retribution-scene,--the murderer, a half-breed called
        "Injun Joe," being barred up in a cavern where he was
        accustomed to hide the money got by robbery. He is entombed
        there accidentally, it having been thought necessary to
        close up the cave after Tom and Becky had been lost in it,
        and nearly perished. When "Injun Joe" is finally tracked to
        it, the villagers rush to the spot, and, opening the cave,
        find him <a name="b" id="b">there</a> dead.<br />

        <br />

        <p>The humor of the book breaks out everywhere in little
        touches, and is, of course, the chief characteristics of
        many of the chapters. The showing-off day at a
        boarding-school, when the young misses parade in their
        ribbons, is portrayed with exquisite drollery; and the
        poetical compositions recited on the occasion are given
        with a realistic exactness which cannot be surpassed. The
        author assures us that these compositions are genuine, and
        so I think I must quote some of the <a name="c" id=
        "c">specimens</a>:<br />
        <br /></p>

        <br />

        <p>There are some respects in which Mark Twain excels any
        living humorist--if we can still so describe a writer who
        has shown such various powers (which is doubtful)--and one
        in his innate refinement and self-restraint. With perfect
        freedom in his style he is never coarse, and spontaneous as
        his fun is it never overpasses the temperance of all true
        art. And another unique feature of his is the stately and
        dignified way in which he deals with the seemingly small
        subject which has excited his sympathy. Landseer gave
        grandeur to a donkey, and Mark Twain paints a scene between
        a dog and a pinch-bug with such true perception of
        universal laws, that is quite worthy to occur, as it does,
        in church, and to extinguish the parson's sermon, which is
        not half so important. That Mark is a philosopher is amply
        proved by <a name="d" id="d">the following
        incident:</a><br />

        <p>Tom Sawyer, having offended his guardian, Aunt Polly, is
        by that sternly-affectionate dame punished, by being set to
        whitewash the fence in front of the garden. The world
        seemed a hollow mockery to Tom, who had planned fun for
        that day, and who knew that he would be the laughing stock
        of all the boys as they came past and saw him, set to work
        like a 'nigger.' But a great inspiration burst upon him,
        and he went tranquilly to work. What that inspiration was
        will appear from what follows. One of the boys, Ben.
        Rogers, comes by and pauses, eating a particularly fine
        apple. Tom does not see him. Ben. stared a moment, and then
        <a name="e" id="e">said:</a><br />
        <br /></p>

        <p>In a brief preface the author tells us that most of the
        adventures recorded in his book really occurred with
        himself or his schoolmates; that Huck Finn is drawn from
        life, and others are composite characters; and the odd
        superstitions touched upon are such as prevailed among
        children and slaves in the west thirty years ago.
        "Although," he says, "my book is intended mainly for the
        entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be
        shunned by men and women on that account, for a part of my
        plan has been to try pleasantly to remind adults of what
        they once were themselves, and of how they felt and talked
        and what queer enterprises them sometimes engaged in." I
        feel quite sure that the book will be a favorite in
        England, among grown-up folk, and also among the boys and
        girls of the fifty thousand governesses, enumerated in the
        new census, who guard the Hesperides of youth, permit
        anything so fresh, and natural, and free from cant and
        pietism, to find its way into their little heads and
        hearts. But however this may be, Mark Twain has written a
        book which will cause all sensible people to love and honor
        him, and at the same time will inspire a doubt whether it
        will be really true that, as he states in an article in
        Temple Bar, he has found perfect happiness in Connecticut
        by the simple plan of killing his conscience. Meanwhile, to
        Americans abroad, it will be a proud centennial fact that
        if we have our Belknaps and Babcocks, we also have our
        Twain of a different stamp, and if Missouri is for the time
        presented in the White House by a Grant, Tom Sawyers,
        though at present in the rough, are growing up in the
        background, and may come to the front. Nay, as these things
        happened thirty years ago, Tom must be somewhere about, and
        I recommend the political conventions, in choosing our next
        president, to look out for him. No doubt information may be
        obtained in the neighborhood of Hartford. "There's millions
        in it."</p>
