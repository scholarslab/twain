  <h3><i>Tom Sawyer</i>: Chapter 5</h3>

  <p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously
  through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by
  began to nod -- and yet it was an argument that dealt in
  limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect
  down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom
  counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how
  many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about
  the discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a
  little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
  assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when
  the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child
  should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the
  great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
  conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking
  nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself
  that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.</p>

  <p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was
  resumed. Presently he bethought</p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 63</tt><br />
  him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black
  beetle with formidable jaws -- a "pinchbug," he called it. It was
  in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
  take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle
  went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt
  finger went into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working
  its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed
  for it; lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over.
  Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach.
  Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the
  beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
  idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the
  quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the
  beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the
  prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked
  around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then
  lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it;
  made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided
  to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued
  his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and
  absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
  descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp
  yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple
  of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring
  spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went
  behind

  fans and handkerchiefs, and Tomwas entirely happy. The dog looked
  foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his
  heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle
  and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every
  point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of
  the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth,
  and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew
  tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly
  but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close
  to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot
  the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild
  yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps
  continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of
  the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the
  doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his
  progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its
  orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic
  sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master's
  lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress
  quickly thinned away and died in the distance.

  <p>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating
  with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead
  standstill. The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame
  and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end;
  for even</p>
  <hr />
  <tt>Page 65</tt><br />
  the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a
  smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote
  pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious
  thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the
  ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.

  <p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that
  there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a
  bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was
  willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did
  not think it was upright in him to carry it off.</p>
