          <p>Tom Sawyer is a bit of a scamp, a kind of juvenile Gil
          Blas, an <i>enfant terrible</i>, a schoolboy full of
          practical jokes and solemn impositions, who wins a
          Sunday-school Bible by buying tickets, and proves his
          assiduous study by the astounding answer to the question,
          "Who were the first two apostles?" "David and Goliath."
          He absconds from school, and with a village ne'er-do-well
          sets up for a pirate on an island in the river, then
          steals home at night to listen to his old aunt weeping
          over him as drowned, and is furtively present on Sunday
          to hear his funeral sermon preached. In one of his
          escapades he is witness of a midnight murder--gets lost
          in a cave on the Mississippi, finds the murderer and his
          treasure, and ends his schoolboy days by being a hero.
          The book is full of roaring fun, interspersed with
          touches of true pathos. It will have the effect of making
          boys think that an unscrupulous scapegrace is sure to
          turn out a noble man; it might therefore have given more
          emphasis to truth and straightforwardness. But it is
          irresistible; fully up to the mark of the "Innocents
          Abroad."</p>
