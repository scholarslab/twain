        <i>Thomas Bailey Aldrich's</i> Story of a Bad Boy <i>first
        appeared serially, in 1869 in</i> Our Young Folks
        <i>magazine. The "bad boy" is named Tom Bailey, and is, as
        Alrich's adult narrator says at the outset, "not such a
        very bad, but a pretty bad boy." The title makes it clear
        that Aldrich, like MT, intends his story as a kind of
        counter-narrative: neither Tom is a "model boy." Aldrich's
        book is an account of his childhood in "Rivermouth," New
        Hampshire, and focuses on various adventures as remembered
        and retold by the man he grew into. I picked the selection
        below because it helps suggest how much a fiction like this
        one, or</i> Tom Sawyer<i>, or even</i> Little Women<i>,
        although ostensibly written for children, appeals to the
        generation of contemporary grown ups as an act of
        nostalgia. Here, as the narrator describes heroism in
        combat, what is obviously being evoked and nostalgically
        elided at the same time is the Civil War (which was when
        Americans learned to read "order of battle maps" like the
        one Aldrich includes). In the simpler times being
        remembered, young men from the "North" and "South" fight
        bravely -- and no one dies or is permanently disfigured.
        Neither Bailey nor MT fought in the War, but I'm sure their
        accounts of ante-bellum innocence helped contemporaries
        struggling to digest the trauma of the War.</i><br />

        <img src="bailey3.jpg" align="left" alt ="INPAGE ILLUSTRATION" /> HE memory of man,
        even that of the Oldest Inhabitant, runneth not back to the
        time when there did not exist a feud between the North End
        and the South End boys of Rivermouth.<br />

        <p>The origin of the feud is involved in mystery; it is
        impossible to say which party was the first aggressor in
        the far-off ante-revolutionary ages; but the fact remains
        that the youngsters of those antipodal sections entertained
        a mortal hatred for each other, and that this hatred had
        been handed down from generation to generation, like Miles
        Standish's punch-bowl.</p>

        <p>I know not what laws, natural or unnatural, regulated
        the warmth of the quarrel; but at some seasons it raged
        more violently than at others. This winter both parties
        were unusually lively and antagonistic. Great was the wrath
        of the South-Enders, when they discovered that the
        North-Enders had thrown up a fort on the crown of Slatter's
        Hill.</p>

        <p>Slatter's Hill, or No-man's-land, as it was generally
        called, was a rise of ground covering, perhaps, an acre and
        a quarter, situated on an imaginary line, marking the
        boundary between the two districts. An immense stratum of
        granite, which here and there thrust out a wrinkled
        boulder, prevented the site from being used for building
        purposes. The street ran on either side of the hill, from
        one part of which a quantity of rock had been removed to
        form the underpinning of the new jail. This excavation made
        the approach from that point all but impossible, especially
        when the ragged ledges were a-glitter with ice. You see
        what a spot it was for a snow-fort.</p>

        <p>One evening twenty or thirty of the North-Enders quietly
        took possession of Slatter's Hill, and threw up a strong
        line of breastworks, something after this shape: --</p>

        <center>
          <img src="bailey4.jpg" alt ="INPAGE ILLUSTRATION" />
        </center>

        <p>The rear of the intrenchment, being protected by the
        quarry, was left open. The walls were four feet high, and
        twenty-two inches thick, strengthened at the angles by
        stakes driven firmly into the ground.</p>

        <p>Fancy the rage of the South-Enders the next day, when
        they spied our snowy citadel, with Jack Harris's red silk
        pocket-handkerchief floating defiantly from the
        flag-staff.</p>

        <p>In less than an hour it was known all over town, in
        military circles at least, that the "Puddle-dockers" and
        the "River-rats" (these were the derisive sub-titles
        bestowed on our South-End foes) intended to attack the fort
        that Saturday afternoon.</p>

        <p>At two o'clock all the fighting boys of the Temple
        Grammar School, and as many recruits as we could muster,
        lay behind the walls of Fort Slatter, with three hundred
        compact snow-balls piled up in pyramids, awaiting the
        approach of the enemy. The enemy was not slow in making his
        approach, -- fifty strong, headed by one Mat Ames. Our
        forces were under the command of General J. Harris.</p>

        <p>Before the action commenced, a meeting was arranged
        between the rival commanders, who drew up and signed
        certain rules and regulations respecting the conduct of the
        battle. As it was impossible for the North-Enders to occupy
        the fort permanently, it was stipulated that the
        South-Enders should assault it only on Wednesday and
        Saturday afternoons between the hours of two and six. For
        them to take possession of the place at any other time was
        not to constitute a capture, but on the contrary was to be
        considered a dishonorable and cowardly act.</p>

        <p>The North-Enders, on the other hand, agreed to give up
        the fort whenever ten of the storming party succeeded in
        obtaining at one time a footing on the parapet, and were
        able to hold the same for the space of two minutes. Both
        sides were to abstain from putting pebbles into their
        snow-balls, nor was it permissible to use frozen
        ammunition. A snow-ball soaked in water and left out to
        cool was a projectile which in previous years had been
        resorted to with disastrous results.</p>

        <p>These preliminaries settled, the commanders retired to
        their respective corps. The interview had taken place on
        the hillside between the opposing lines.</p>

        <p>General Harris divided his men into two bodies; the
        first comprised the most skillful marksmen, or gunners; the
        second, the reserve force, was composed of the strongest
        boys, whose duty it was to repel the scaling parties, and
        to make occasional sallies for the purpose of capturing
        prisoners, who were bound by the articles of treaty to
        faithfully serve under our flag until they were exchanged
        at the close of the day.</p>

        <p>The repellers were called light infantry; but when they
        carried on operations beyond the fort they became cavalry.
        It was also their duty, when not otherwise engaged, to
        manufacture snow-balls. The General's staff consisted of
        five Templars (I among the number, with the rank of Major),
        who carried the General's orders and looked after the
        wounded.</p>

        <p>General Mat Ames, a veteran commander, was no less
        wide-awake in the disposition of his army. Five companies,
        each numbering but six men, in order not to present too big
        a target to our sharpshooters, were to charge the fort from
        different points, their advance being covered by a heavy
        fire from the gunners posted in the rear. Each scaler was
        provided with only two rounds of ammunition, which were not
        to be used until he had mounted the breastwork and could
        deliver his shots on our heads</p>

        <p>The following cut represents the interior of the fort
        just previous to the assault. Nothing on earth could
        represent the state of things after the first volley.</p>

        <center>
          <img src="bailey5.jpg" alt ="INPAGE ILLUSTRATION" />
        </center>

        <p>The thrilling moment had now arrived. If I had been
        going into a real engagement I could not have been more
        deeply impressed by the importance of the occasion.</p>

        <p>The fort opened fire first, -- a single ball from the
        dexterous hand of General Harris taking General Ames in the
        very pit of his stomach. A cheer went up from Fort Slatter.
        In an instant the air was thick with flying missiles, in
        the midst of which we dimly descried the storming parties
        sweeping up the hill, shoulder to shoulder. The shouts of
        the leaders, and the snow-balls bursting like shells about
        our ears, made it very lively.</p>

        <p>Not more than a dozen of the enemy succeeded in reaching
        the crest of the hill; five of these clambered upon the icy
        walls, where they were instantly grabbed by the legs and
        jerked into the fort. The rest retired confused and blinded
        by our well-directed fire.</p>

        <p>When General Harris (with his right eye bunged up) said,
        "Soldiers, I am proud of you!" my heart swelled in my
        bosom.</p>

        <p>The victory, however, had not been without its price.
        Six North-Enders, having rushed out to harass the
        discomfitted enemy, were gallantly cut off by General Ames
        and captured. Among these were Lieutenant P. Whitcomb (who
        had no business to join in the charge, being weak in the
        knees), and Captain Fred Langdon, of General Harris's
        staff. Whitcomb was one of the most notable shots on our
        side, though he was not much to boast of in a
        rough-and-tumble fight, owing to the weakness before
        mentioned. General Ames put him among the gunners, and we
        were quickly made aware of the loss we had sustained, by
        receiving a frequent artful ball which seemed to light with
        unerring instinct on any nose that was the least bit
        exposed. I have known one of Pepper's snow-balls, fired
        point-blank, to turn a corner and hit a boy who considered
        himself absolutely safe.</p>

        <p>But we had no time for vain regrets. The battle raged.
        Already there were two bad cases of black eye, and one of
        nose-bleed, in the hospital.</p>

        <p>It was glorious excitement, those pell-mell onslaughts
        and hand-to-hand struggles. Twice we were within an ace of
        being driven from our stronghold, when General Harris and
        his staff leaped recklessly upon the ramparts and hurled
        the beseigers heels over head down hill.</p>

        <p>At sunset, the garrison of Fort Slatter was still
        unconquered, and the South-Enders, in a solid phalanx,
        marched off whistling "Yankee Doodle," while we cheered and
        jeered them until they were out of hearing.</p>

        <p>General Ames remained behind to effect an exchange of
        prisoners. We held thirteen of his men, and he eleven of
        ours. General Ames proposed to call it an even thing, since
        many of his eleven prisoners were officers, while nearly
        all our thirteen captives were privates. A dispute arising
        on this point, the two noble generals came to fisticuffs,
        and in the fracas our brave commander got his remaining
        well eye badly damaged. This didn't prevent him from
        writing a general order the next day, on a slate, in which
        he complimented the troops on their heroic behavior.</p>

        <p>On the following Wednesday the seige was renewed. I
        forget whether it was on that afternoon or the next that we
        lost Fort Slatter; but lose it we did, with much valuable
        ammunition and several men. After a series of desperate
        assaults, we forced General Ames to capitulate; and he, in
        turn, made the place too hot to hold us. So from day to day
        the tide of battle surged to and fro, sometimes favoring
        our arms, and sometimes those of the enemy.</p>

        <p>General Ames handled his men with great skill; his
        deadliest foe could not deny that. Once he out-generalled
        our commander in the following manner: He massed his
        gunners on our left and opened a brisk fire, under cover of
        which a single company (six men) advanced on that angle of
        the fort. Our reserves on the right rushed over to defend
        the threatened point. Meanwhile, four companies of the
        enemy's scalers made a <i>detour</i> round the foot of the
        hill, and dashed into Fort Slatter without opposition. At
        the same moment General Ames's gunners closed in on our
        left, and there we were between two fires. Of course we had
        to vacate the fort. A cloud rested on General Harris's
        military reputation until his superior tactics enabled him
        to dispossess the enemy.</p>

        <p>As the winter wore on, the war-spirit waxed fiercer and
        fiercer. At length the provision against using heavy
        substances in the snow-balls was disregarded. A ball stuck
        full of sand-bird shot came tearing into Fort Slatter. In
        retaliation, General Harris ordered a broadside of shells;
        i.e. snow-balls containing marbles. After this, both sides
        never failed to freeze their ammunition.</p>

        <p>It was no longer child's play to march up to the walls
        of Fort Slatter, nor was the position of the besieged less
        perilous. At every assault three or four boys on each side
        were disabled. It was not an infrequent occurrence for the
        combatants to hold up a of truce while they removed some
        insensible comrade.</p>

        <p>Matters grew worse and worse. Seven North-Enders had
        been seriously wounded, and a dozen South-Enders were
        reported on the sick list The selectmen of the town awoke
        to the fact of what was going on, and detailed a posse of
        police to prevent further disturbance. The boys at the foot
        of the hill, South-Enders as it happened, finding
        themselves assailed in the rear and on the flunk, turned
        round and attempted to beat off the watchmen. In this they
        were sustained by numerous volunteers from the fort, who
        looked upon the interference as tyrannical.</p>

        <p>The watch were determined fellows, and charged the boys
        valiantly, driving them all into the fort, where we made
        common cause, fighting side by side like the best of
        friends. In vain the four guardians of the peace rushed up
        the hill, flourishing their clubs and calling upon us to
        surrender. They could not get within ten yards of the fort,
        our fire was so destructive. In one of the onsets a man
        named Mugridge, more valorous than his peers, threw himself
        upon the parapet, when he was seized by twenty pairs of
        hands, and dragged inside the breastwork, where fifteen
        boys sat down on him to keep him quiet.</p>

        <p>Perceiving that it was impossible with their small
        number to dislodge us, the watch sent for reinforcements.
        Their call was responded to, not only by the whole
        constabulary force (eight men), but by a numerous body of
        citizens, who had become alarmed at the prospect of a riot.
        This formidable array brought us to our senses: we began to
        think that maybe discretion was the better part of valor.
        General Harris and General Ames, with their respective
        staffs, held a council of war in the hospital and a
        backward movement was decided on. So, after one grand
        farewell volley, we fled, sliding, jumping, rolling,
        tumbling down the quarry at the rear of the fort, and
        escaped without losing a man.</p>

        <p>But we lost Fort Slatter forever. Those battle-scarred
        ramparts were razed to the ground, and humiliating ashes
        sprinkled over the historic spot, near which a solitary
        lynx-eyed policeman was seen prowling from time to time
        during the rest of the winter.</p>

        <p>The event passed into legend, and afterwards, when later
        instances of pluck and endurance were spoken of, the boys
        would say, "By golly! you ought to have been at the fights
        on Slatter's Hill!"</p>
