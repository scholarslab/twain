          <p>This newest work of Mark Twain increases the
          difficulty of assigning that author a literary
          <i>habitat.</i> "American humorist" has for some time
          been recognised as too vague a label to attach to a
          writer whose "Jumping Frog" and other early sketches have
          been reduced to mere fragments and ventures by such
          productions as <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> and <i>The New
          Pilgrim's Progress,</i> in which, while the humour is
          still fresh, there is present an equal art in graphic
          description of natural scenery, and a fine sense of what
          is genuinely impressive in the grandeurs of the past.
          Those who have travelled with Mark Twain with some
          curiosity to observe the effect of the ancient world
          interpreted by a very shrewd eye, fresh from the newest
          outcome of civilisation, may have expected to find
          antiquity turned into a solemn joke, but they can hardly
          have failed to discover a fine discrimination present at
          each step in the path of the "new pilgrim"; while he
          sheds tears of a kind hardly relished by the
          superstitious or sentimental over the supposed grave of
          his deceased parent Adam, he can "listen deep" when any
          true theme from the buried world reaches his ear. Without
          being pathetic he is sympathetic, and there is also an
          innate refinement in his genius felt in every subject it
          selects and in his treatment of it. <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
          carries us to an altogether novel region, and along with
          these characteristics displays a somewhat puzzling
          variety of abilities. There is something almost stately
          in the simplicity with which he invites us to turn our
          attention to the affairs of some boys and girls growing
          up on the far frontiers of American civilisation. With
          the Eastern Question upon us, and crowned heads arrayed
          on the political stage, it may be with some surprise that
          we find our interest demanded in sundry Western questions
          that are solving themselves through a <i>dramatis
          personae</i> of humble folk whose complications occur in
          a St. Petersburg situated on the Missouri river. Our
          manager, we feel quite sure, would not for a moment allow
          us to consider that any other St. Petersburg is of equal
          importance to that for which he claims our attention.
          What is the deposition, death, or enthronement of a
          Sultan compared with the tragical death of "Injun Joe,"
          the murderer, accidentally buried and entombed in the
          cavern where his stolen treasures are hid? There he was
          <a name="1">found.</a></p>

          <blockquote>
            The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one
            place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly
            growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the
            water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had
            broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had
            placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow
            to catch the precious drop that fell once in every
            three minutes with the dreary regularity of a
            clock-tick -- a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty
            hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were
            new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were
            laid when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror
            created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when
            the massacre at Lexington was "news." It is falling
            now; it will still be falling when all these things
            shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the
            twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the
            thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a
            mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five
            thousand years to be ready for this flitting human
            insect's need? and has it another important object to
            accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is
            many and many a year since the hapless half-breed
            scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but
            to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic
            stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see
            the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands
            first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even
            "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it.
          </blockquote>

          <p>In such writing as this we seem to be reading some
          classic fable, such as the Persian Sadi might point with
          his moral, "Set not your heart on things that are
          transitory; the Tigris will run through Bagdat after the
          race of Caliphs is extinct." Nor is this feeling of the
          dignity of his subject absent when the author is
          describing the most amusing incidents. Indeed, a great
          deal of Mark Twain's humour consists in the serious -- or
          even at times severe -- style in which he narrates his
          stories and portrays his scenes, as one who feels that
          the universal laws are playing through the very slightest
          of them. The following is a scene in which the principal
          actors are a dog, a boy, and a beetle, the place being
          the <a name="2">chapel:</a> --</p>

            The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through
            with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much
            admired in that part of the country. His voice began on
            a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
            certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon
            the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a
            spring-board:<br />

            <blockquote>
              Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry beds
              of ease,<br />
              Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro'
              blood-y seas?
            </blockquote>&#x00A0; &#x00A0; He was regarded as a
            wonderful reader. At church "sociables" he was always
            called upon to read poetry; and when he was through,
            the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall
            helplessly in their laps, and "wall" their eyes, and
            shake their heads, as much as to say, "Words cannot
            express it; it is too beautiful, too beautiful for this
            mortal earth."<br />
            &#x00A0; &#x00A0; After the hymn had been sung, the Rev.
            Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and
            read off "notices" of meetings and societies and things
            till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the
            crack of doom -- a queer custom which is still kept up
            in America, even in cities, away here in this age of
            abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to
            justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get
            rid of it.<br />
            &#x00A0; &#x00A0; And now the minister prayed. A good,
            generous prayer it was, and went into details: it
            pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
            church; for the other churches of the village; for the
            village itself; for the county; for the State; for the
            State officers; for the United States; for the churches
            of the United States; for Congress; for the President;
            for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors,
            tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions
            groaning under the heel of European monarchies and
            Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the
            good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to
            hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the
            sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he
            was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be
            as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
            grateful harvest of good. Amen.<br />
            &#x00A0; &#x00A0; There was a rustling of dresses, and the
            standing congregation sat down. The boy whose history
            this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only
            endured it -- if he even did that much. He was restive
            all through it; he kept tally of the details of the
            prayer, unconsciously -- for he was not listening, but
            he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular
            route over it -- and when a little trifle of new matter
            was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole
            nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and
            scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit
            on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his
            spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing
            its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously
            that it seemed to almost part company with the body,
            and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view;
            scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing
            them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going
            through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it
            was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as
            Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare --
            he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he
            did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But
            with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and
            steal forward; and the instant the "Amen" was out the
            fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act
            and made him let it go.<br />
            &#x00A0; &#x00A0; The minister gave out his text and droned
            along monotonously through an argument that was so
            prosy that many a head by and by began to nod -- and
            yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and
            brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a
            company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom
            counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always
            knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew
            anything else about the discourse. However, this time
            he was really interested for a little while. The
            minister made a grand and moving picture of the
            assembling together of the world's hosts at the
            millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down
            together and a little child should lead them. But the
            pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle
            were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
            conspicuousness of the principal character before the
            on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and
            he said to himself that he wished he could be that
            child, if it was a tame lion.
          </blockquote>

          <p>The scene we have selected is not so laughable,
          perhaps, as some others in the volume, but it indicates
          very well the kind of art in which Mark Twain is
          pre-eminent in our time. Every movement of boy, beetle,
          and poodle, is described not merely with precision, but
          with a subtle sense of meaning in every movement.
          Everything is alive, and every face physiognomical. From
          a novel so replete with good things, and one so full of
          significance, as it brings before us what we can feel is
          the real spirit of home life in the far West, there is no
          possibility of obtaining extracts which will convey to
          the reader any idea of the purport of the book. The
          scenes and characters cannot be really seen apart from
          their grouping and environment. The book will no doubt be
          a great favourite with boys, for whom it must in good
          part have been intended; but next to boys we should say
          that it might be most prized by philosophers and poets.
          The interior life, the everyday experiences, of a small
          village on the confines of civilisation and in the
          direction of its advance, may appear, antecedently, to
          supply but thin material for a romance; but still it is
          at just that same little pioneer point that humanity is
          growing with the greatest freedom, and unfolding some of
          its unprescribed tendencies. We can, indeed, hardly
          imagine a more felicitous task for a man of genius to
          have accomplished than to have seized the salient,
          picturesque, droll, and at the same time most significant
          features of human life, as he has himself lived it and
          witnessed it, in a region where it is continually
          modified in relation to new circumstances. The chief
          fault of the story is its brevity, and it will, we doubt
          not, be widely and thoroughly enjoyed by young and old
          for its fun and its philosophy.</p>
