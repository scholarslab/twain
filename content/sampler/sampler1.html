<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; One of the main goals of this site is to make the
  rare and often unique Twain items in the Barrett Collection
  available to users around the world. At left is part of the first
  page of the manuscript of "A True Story," a sketch MT wrote in
  1874. Based on the experience of slavery of "Aunt Rachel" (whom
  MT knew as a servant at Quarry Farm, where he was finishing
  <i>Tom Sawyer</i>), it was MT's first sustained attempt to
  represent African American speech. It was also the first of his
  works ever to be published in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>.
  Clicking on the image will take you to the complete text and
  29-page manuscript of the tale, as they are displayed in the
  site's section of the sources of <i>Huck Finn</i>.</font></p></td>

<td><a href="../onstage/82toast.html"><img src="toast.jpg" align="right" alt="DETAIL: 1882 MANUSCRIPT" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; The Barrett Collection contains the manuscripts of several of
  MT's speeches. Although he sought to give his live performances
  an air of improvisation, he always carefully wrote out even his
  after-dinner "toasts" beforehand, and memorized them while
  rehearsing them in private. At left is part of the first page of
  a sixteen-page tribute "To Woman" that MT delivered at
  Delmonico's in New York in 1882. Clicking on the image will take
  you to the display of this speech in "Mark Twain on Stage," where
  you can see the entire manuscript (and see how carefully MT
  prepared his live performances). You can also read the press
  reports to see how the men at the banquet enjoyed the
  performance.</font></p></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; Several dozen of MT's letters can also be "seen" throughout the
  site. Seventeen of them are gathered together in an interactive
  exhibit that displays the many different names Sam Clemens and
  Mark Twain used to identify themselves. You can go there by
  clicking on the image at left.</font></p></td>

<td><a href="../wilson/calendar.html"><img src="../marketin/pwcal.jpg" align="right" alt= "1894 PROMOTIONAL CALENDAR" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; The site contains many different kinds of promotional materials
  created by MT and his publishers: prospectuses, posters, ads,
  brochures, and novelty items like the one at left. This pocket
  edition of "Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar" was produced by <i>The
  Century Magazine</i> to advertise its ongoing serial publication
  of the novel. There are two versions of this "text" in the
  Barrett Collection. MT signed the one at left "with Wilson's
  compliments" for presentation to Bram Stoker, the author of
  <i>Dracula</i>. Clicking on it will take you to the other
  version, as displayed in the "<i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>" section
  of the site.</font></p></td>

<td>
  <p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; One of the most recent additions to the Barrett Twain Collection
  is the typescript for a very short story called "How the
  Chimney-Sweep Got the Ear of the Emperor." Special Collections
  already owned the manuscript, which MT wrote in Vienna late in
  1899. By then MT was regularly having his mss. typed before
  sending them to be printed, but this is apparently the earliest
  ts. that has survived. You can see digital facsimiles of both the
  ms. and the ts. (with MT's revisions and comments on both) by
  clicking on the icon at left, which will take you to a critical
  edition of the story designed and written by Catherine
  Tousignant, former Associate Director of the E-Text Center, for a
  graduate class at U.Va.</font></p></td>

  <td>
  <p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; And then there are the kinds of items that only MT -- with his
  wide range of interests, his impulsive imagination and his
  lifelong ambition for money -- could produce. Included in that
  category is the Barrett Collection's copy of a game MT designed
  and marketed during the 1880s. You can see it by clicking on the
  image at left. If you want to play it, you'll have to get your
  own copy. (You can play this site's interactive "Memory" game --
    loosely based on MT's -- by</font> <a href=
