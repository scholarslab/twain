  ILLUSTRATIONS</b><font size="+1">!" That's what MT's contemporary
  readers knew they would find in each of his popular books. These
  pictures played a major role in shaping the way MT's texts were
  read. In this site are hundreds of illustrations too, including
  hundreds from the various publications of MT's work. The one at
  left, by True Williams, is the first glimpse readers had of Huck
  Finn. Clicking on it will take you to the exhibit on Williams'
  illustrations of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.</font></p></td>

  The pictures drawn from MT's texts illustrate more than one kind
  of story. How Jim was depicted, for example, gives us access to
  popular images of African Americans in MT's time, and since. The
  picture at left was drawn by E.W. Kemble, the original
  illustrator of <i>Huck Finn</i>, for an 1899 newspaper article.
  Clicking on it will take you to a collection in the <i>Huck
  Finn</i> part of this site of that brings together
  representations of Jim from all the illustrated American editions
  of the novel between 1885 and 1985.</font></p></td>

  To many readers the most vivid and best-known of MT's characters
  was "Mark Twain" himself. He was the central character in
  <i>Innocents Abroad</i>, his best-selling book, and many of his
  other books and sketches. The depiction at left is from
  <i>Following the Equator</i>, published when MT was over 60.
  Clicking on it will take you to an exhibit in the part of the
  site called "Sam Clemens as Mark Twain." There you can see for
  yourself how in his own works MT and his illustrators created and
  manipulated the image of "Mark Twain."</font></p></td>

  The image of "Mark Twain" was also regularly kept in his
  contemporaries' view through many magazine and newspaper
  articles, where scores of different artists assembled his
  distinctive features -- hair, moustache, deadpan expression,
  lively eyes, cigar, and eventually the white suit -- into their
  own generally loving caricatures. The picture at left is one of
  the fifteen "Mark Twain's" who appeared in <i>Life</i> magazine
  between 1883 and 1907. Clicking on it will take you to an exhibit
  of all fifteen.</font></p></td>

  "Mark Twain" was also one of the most frequently photographed
  people in the nineteenth century (some have said</font>
  <b>THE</b> <font size="+1">most photographed). Throughout this
  site are many of these photos, some familiar, some very rare.
  Clicking on the one at left will take you to a display in the
  "Mark Twain on Stage" section of eight snapshots taken by Major
  J.B. Pond when he was traveling as MT's manager during the
  American leg of MT's 1895 lecture tour around the
  world.</font></p></td>
