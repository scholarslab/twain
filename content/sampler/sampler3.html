<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; A main goal of this site is to develop new
      ways to organize material to explore the possibilities of an
      electronic archive. Each part of the site allows users to
      follow their interests in various directions and to varying
      depths. For example, clicking on the image <i>at left</i>
      will take you to one of the sites
      "</font><b>PRETEXTS</b><font size="+1">" exhibits, this one
      on the "Sources of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>." There you'll find
      selections from other contemporary texts about childhood,
      chosen to help put MT's novel in the cultural and literary
      context of "His Times."</font></p></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; "His Times," of
      course, takes in a subject much too huge for any site to
      represent, but an electronic archive is not bound by the
      limits of print anthologies. In virtual reality you can store
      enormous amounts of material while keeping it all within the
      reach of the fingers on the keyboard or mouse. In the
      site's</font> <b>ROUGHING IT</b> <font size="+1">section are
      dozens of texts and hundreds of images from accounts of the
      American "West" published between the time MT first went west
      himself (1861) and the appearance of his book (1872),
      organized according to the route he followed and the
      narrative of <i>Roughing It</i>. Thus by clicking on the icon
      <i>above left</i> you can see how, for example, MT's account
      of Native Americans (and its accompanying illustrations)
      compares to other contemporary words and pictures.</font></p></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; There are also specific
      exhibits designed to give users as much interactive control
      as possible. In the site's</font> <b>MARK TWAIN ON STAGE</b>
      <font size="+1">section, for example, the hypertext schedules
      of MT's major American lecture tours let you "attend"
      different performances from either the audience's side (by
      clicking on reviews in various local papers) or the
      entertainer's (by reading from letters MT wrote while on
      tour). The link at left leads to the schedule of the
      1884-1885 reading tour that MT arranged to promote <i>Huck
      Finn</i>.</font></p></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp;       Or you can follow MT on his lecture tours a different way.
      This icon (<i>left</i>) links to a set of maps in the</font>
      <b>MARK TWAIN ON STAGE</b> <font size="+1">section showing
      the stops on seven of MT's North American speaking tours
      between 1866 and 1895. These maps are interactive too,
      allowing users to access the archive's lecture reviews
      geographically. They also make it possible to appreciate
      graphically just what parts of the country MT visited to
      perform live for his audience -- and (also part of the story
      of his relationship to his time and place) what parts he
      never spoke to in person.</font></p></td>

      <a href="../huckfinn/hfillcomp.html"><img src="comppix.jpg"
      align="right" alt= "SCREEN IMAGE" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; The agility with which
      computers can display graphics pushes us to think about the
      stories pictures tell. Clicking on the icon at left will take
      you to an interactive exhibit in the</font> <b>HUCK FINN</b>
      <font size="+1">section that allows you to create your own
      comparisons of the novel's original illustrations to see what
      they reveal about the way character was constructed in MT's
      times according to preconceptions about race, class and
      gender.</font></p></td>

<tr>
<td><a href="../innocent/webmap.html"><img src="../innocent/webmapa.gif" align="right"
      alt= "DETAIL: INTERACTIVE MAP" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; Once
      texts are on-line, it is also possible to display and even to
      conceptualize them anew. The map <i>at left</i> displays the
      route MT took in 1867 on the <i>Quaker City</i> pilgrimage to
      Europe and the Holy Land. It's also (as you'll see by
      clicking on it) a hypertext map of <i>Innocents Abroad</i>
      that redeploys MT's narrative in terms that are spacial,
      non-linear, and also geographical, racial and ethnic.
      "Plotting" texts in such formats enables a reader to explore
      and perhaps appreciate their meaning or achievement in new
      ways.</font></p></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; One of the best and most interactive
      features of an electronic text is its "searchability." There
      is a lot to be learned from the kinds of information a
      computer search can provide. How often specific words or
      phrases are used in a book, where they appear, what words or
      phrases they are associated with -- students can use that
      information to begin researching papers and readers can use
      it to confirm interpretive impressions. (It's interesting,
      for example, to compare the number of times forms of the
      words "free" and "slave" appear in <i>Huck Finn</i>, and then
      to compare both again with their appearances in <i>Pudd'nhead
      Wilson</i>.) You can search the many MT texts in this site,
      and all the reviews of them and of his live performances, by
      clicking on the image at left.</font></p></td>

      <td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp;
      The frog at left is from a poster for one of MT's live
      performances. In his times MT was as well known for his
      lectures and speeches and one-liners as for his books. Tens
      of thousands of people around the world heard him in person,
      and hundreds of thousands more had an idea what he sounded
      like, because few who heard him failed to comment on his very
      distinctive voice. We can't ever hear "Mark Twain," but if
      your computer is equipped to play audio files you can, in
      the</font> <b>ON STAGE</b> <font size="+1">portion of this
      site, hear four modern Mark Twain impersonators give their
      lovingly recreated versions of "His Voice."</font></p></td>
