  <font size="+1">One of the main goals of this site is to make the
  rare and often unique Twain items in the Barrett Collection
  available to users around the world. At left is part of the first
  page of the manuscript of "A True Story," a sketch MT wrote in
  1874. Based on the experience of slavery of "Aunt Rachel" (whom
  MT knew as a servant at Quarry Farm, where he was finishing
  <i>Tom Sawyer</i>), it was MT's first sustained attempt to
  represent African American speech. It was also the first of his
  works ever to be published in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>.
  Clicking on the image will take you to the complete text and
  29-page manuscript of the tale, as they are displayed in the
  site's section of the sources of <i>Huck Finn</i>.<br clear=

  <a href="../huckfinn/defaced.html"><img src="silas.jpg" align=

  On a much less serious note -- except to MT, whose own publishing
  company lost $10,000 because of it -- is the Barrett Collection's
  rare copy of the original sales prospectus for <i>Huck Finn</i>.
  The prospectus had to be withdrawn from circulation, and altered
  and rebound, after it was discovered that someone at the
  engraving plant had turned Uncle Silas into a flasher. By
  clicking on the image at left you can see more of Silas than you
  were meant to.<br clear="left" />

  <a href="../onstage/82toast.html"><img src="toast.jpg" align=

  The Barrett Collection contains the manuscripts of several of
  MT's speeches. Although he sought to give his live performances
  an air of improvisation, he always carefully wrote out even his
  after-dinner "toasts" beforehand, and memorized them while
  rehearsing them in private. At left is part of the first page of
  a sixteen-page comic tribute "To Woman" (a staple toast of
  nineteenth century American banquets) that MT delivered at
  Delmonico's in New York in 1882. Clicking on the image will take
  you to the display of this speech in "Mark Twain on Stage," where
  you can "see" the entire manuscript (and see how carefully MT
  prepared his live performances) and read press reviews of
  it.<br clear="left" />
  <br/>
  <a href="../sc_as_mt/yrstruly.html"><img src=
  "../sc_as_mt/quotmt.gif" align="left"  alt= "" /></a><br/>
  Several dozen of MT's letters can also be "seen" throughout the
  site. Twelve of them are gathered together in an interactive
  exhibit that displays the many different names Sam Clemens and
  Mark Twain used to identify themselves. You can go there by
  clicking on the image at left.<br clear="left" />

  <br/>
  The site contains many different kinds of promotional materials
  created by MT and his publishers: prospectuses, posters, ads,
  brochures, and novelty items like the one at left. This pocket
  edition of "Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar" was produced by <i>The
  Century Magazine</i> to advertise its ongoing serial publication
  of the novel. There are two versions of this "text" in the
  Barrett Collection. MT signed the one at left "with Wilson's
  compliments" for presentation to Bram Stoker, the author of
  <i>Dracula</i>. Clicking on it will take you to the other
  version, as displayed in the "<i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>" section
  of the site.<br clear="left" />

  <br/>
  And then there are the kinds of items that only MT -- with his
  wide range of interests, his impulsive imagination and his
  lifelong ambition for money -- could produce. Included in that
  category is the Barrett Collection's copy of a game MT designed
  and marketed during the 1880s. You can see it by clicking on the
  image at left. If you want to play it, you'll have to get your
  own copy.<br clear="left" /></font>
