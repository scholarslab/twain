<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp; This site is built around six of MT's full-length
  works, but is also contains dozens of additional works by Mark
  Twain, and scores of texts by other writers in his times. Many of
  the texts include, or allow you to access, their original
  illustrations. <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> is available in two
  different forms: an</font> <b>SGML</b><font size="+1">-coded
  electronic text, and a graphic facsimile of the first edition,
  with the unusual "marginal illustrations" displayed at left.
  Clicking on this sample page will take you to the table of
  contents page for the entire facsimile text. (If you're looking
  for a specific text, you can use the <a href=
  "../about/txtindex.html"><font size="-1">ELECTRONIC
  INDEX</font></a>.)</font></p></td>

  "right" alt= "DETAIL: 1883 SALES PROSPECTUS COVER" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp;  MT's books were not written or designed
  to be sold in bookstores. Instead contemporaries bought them from
  subscription agents who went door-to-door across America taking
  orders for "the new work by Mark Twain." Each agent carried a
  prospectus, a bound volume displaying portions of the forthcoming
  work. Four propsectuses, photographed in their entirety, are
  available in the site. The image at left is from the cover of the
  prospectus for <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>. Clicking on it
  will take you to an exhibit that shows "virtually" how publishers
  trained agents to use these samplers to sell books.</font></p></td>

  "../marketin/webcat.gif" align="right" alt= "DETAIL: 1892 CATALOGUE COVER" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp;  In the
  section called "Marketing Twain" and the sections devoted to
  individual books this site contains a lot of material -- textual
  and visual -- connected with the commercial context of MT's
  texts. The business of promoting and selling the work of his
  imagination was an enterprise MT himself engaged in as
  aggressively as any of his publishers, becoming with <i>Huck
  Finn</i> his own publisher. The image at left is from the cover
  of the 1892 catalogue of MT's publishing company. Clicking on it
  will take you to an exhibit of three catalogues, from three
  different publishers, where you can see for yourself how the
  books we still read were defined and marketed in his
  times.</font></p></td>

  "../onstage/harpers3.jpg" align="right" alt= "COVER: 1905 SOUVENIR PROGRAM" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp;   The hypertextual capabilities of computers are well-suited for
  giving modern readers access to the contemporary contexts of MT's
  various performances, textual and live. Throughout the site the
  design allows users to explore those contexts in various
  directions, from the sources MT drew on to the conclusions
  reviewers and reporters drew from his works. MT's "Seventieth
  Birthday Speech," for example, is still widely reprinted.
  Clicking on the image at left will take you to the way the text
  of that speech is contextualized here, which includes pictures
  and media accounts of the banquet at which MT gave it.</font></p></td>

<tr>
<td>  <a href="../yankee/cymachhp.html"><img src="cysamp.jpg" align=
  "right" alt= "DETAIL: 1876 ILLUSTRATION" /></a></td>

<td><p><font size="+1"> &nbsp;   The site also includes a number of exhibits designed to allow
  readers to explore contemporary cultural or ideological contexts.
  Although it is set in sixth century England, for example, <i>A
  Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> reveals a lot about
  the attitudes and anxieties of late nineteenth-century America.
  At left is the Corliss Steam Engine that powered the exhibits at
  the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. Clicking on it will
  take you to a virtual exhibit designed to suggest MT's, and his
  times', attitude toward technological progress at the time
  <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> was written.</font></p>
