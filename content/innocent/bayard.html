        <p>[<i>from Chapter XIX, "Leipsic and Dresden"</i>] &nbsp;</p>
        <p>The railroad brought us in three hours from Leipsic, over
        the eighty miles of plain that intervene. We came from the
        station through the <i>Neustadt</i>, passing the Japanese
        Palace and the equestrian statue of Augustus the Strong.
        The magnificent bridge over the Elbe was so much injured by
        the late inundation as to be impassable, and we were
        obliged to go some distance up the river bank and cross on
        a bridge of boats. Next morning my first search was for the
        Picture Gallery. We set off at random, and after passing
        the Church of Our Lady, with its lofty dome of solid stone,
        which withstood the heaviest bombs during the war with
        Frederick the Great, came to an open square, one side of
        which was occupied by an old, brown, red-roofed building,
        which I at once recognized as the object of our search.</p>

        <p>I have just taken a last look at the gallery this
        morning, and left it with real regret; for during the two
        visits, Raphael's heavenly picture of the Madonna and Child
        had so grown into my love and admiration, that it was
        painful to think I should never see it again. There are
        many more which clung so strongly to my imagination,
        gratifying in the highest degree the love for the
        Beautiful, that I left them with sadness, and the thought
        that I would now only have the memory. I can see the
        inspired eye and god-like brow of the Jesus-child, as if I
        were still standing before the picture, and the sweet, holy
        countenance of the Madonna still looks upon me. Yet, though
        this picture is a miracle of art, the first glance filled
        me with disappointment. It has somewhat faded, during the
        three hundred years that have rolled away since the hand of
        Raphael worked the canvas and the glass with which it is
        covered for better preservation, injures the effect. After
        I had gazed on it a while every thought of this vanished.
        The figure of the Virgin seemed to soar in the air, and it
        was difficult to think the clouds were not in motion. Two
        divine cherubs look up from below, and in her arms sits the
        sacred child. Those two faces beam from the picture like
        those of angels. The dark, prophetic eye and pure brow of
        the young Jesus chain one like a spell. There is something
        more than mortal in its expression -- something in that
        infant face which indicates a power mightier than the
        proudest manhood. There is no glory around the head; but
        the spirit which shines from those features, marks his
        divinity. In the sweet face of the mother a sorrowful
        forboding mingles with its tenderness, as if she knew the
        world into which the Saviour was born and foresaw the path
        in which he was to tread. It is a picture which one can
        scarce look upon without tears. [pp. 198-200]</p>

        <p>[<i>from Chapter XXXII, "Scenes in Genoa, Leghorn, and
        Pisa"</i>] Has the reader ever seen some grand painting of
        a city, rising with its domes and towers and palaces from
        the edge of a glorious bay, shut in by mountains -- the
        whole scene clad in those deep, delicious, sunny hues,
        which we admire so much in the picture although they appear
        unrealized in Nature? If so, he can figure to himself
        Genoa, as she appeared to us at sunset, from the
        battlements west of the city. When we had passed through
        the gloomy gate of the fortress that guards the western
        promontory, the whole scene opened on us at once in all its
        majesty. The battlements where we were standing, and the
        blue mirror of the Mediterranean just below, with a few
        vessels moored near the shore, made up the foreground; just
        in front lay the queenly city, stretching out to the
        eastern point of the bay, like a great meteor -- this
        point, crowned with the towers and dome of a cathedral,
        representing the nucleus, while the tail gradually widened
        out and was lost among the numberless villas that reached
        to the top of the mountains behind. As we gazed, a purple
        glow lay on the bosom of the sea, while far beyond the
        city, the eastern half of the mountain crescent around the
        gulf was tinted with the loveliest hue of orange. The
        impressions which one derives from looking on remarkable
        scenery depend, for much of their effect, on the time and
        weather. I have been very fortunate in this respect in two
        instances, and shall carry with me through life, two
        glorious pictures of a very different character -- the wild
        sublimity of the Brocken in cloud and storm, and the
        splendor of Genoa in an Italian sunset. [pp. 339-40]</p>

        <p>[<i>from Chapter XXXIII, "Residence in Florence"</i>]
        Italy remains the home of Art, and it is but just she
        should keep these treasures, though the age that brought
        them forth has passed away. They are her only support now;
        her people are dependent for their subsistence on the glory
        of the Past. The spirits of the old painters, living still
        on their canvas, earn from year to year the bread of an
        indigent and oppressed people. This ought to silence those
        utilitarians at home, who oppose the cultivation of the
        fine arts, on the ground of their being useless luxuries.
        Let them look to Italy, where a picture by Raphael or
        Correggio is a rich legacy for a whole city. Nothing is
        useless that gratifies the perception of Beauty, which is
        at once the most delicate and the most intense of our
        mental sensations, binding us by an unconscious link nearer
        to nature and to Him, whose every thought is born of
        Beauty, Truth and Love. I envy not the man who looks with a
        cold and indifferent spirit on these immortal creations of
        the old masters -- these poems written in marble and on the
        canvas. They who oppose every thing which can refine and
        spiritualize the nature of man, by binding him down to the
        cares of the work-day world alone, cheat life of half its
        glory. [pp. 354-55]</p>
