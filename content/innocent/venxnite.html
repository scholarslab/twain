        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Venice By Night</h3><br />

        <p>I began to feel that the old Venice of song and story
        had departed forever. But I was too hasty. In a few minutes
        we swept gracefully out into the Grand Canal, and under the
        mellow moonlight the Venice of poetry and romance stood
        revealed. Right from the water's edge rose long lines of
        stately palaces of marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly
        hither and thither and disappearing suddenly through
        unsuspected gates and alleys; ponderous stone bridges threw
        their shadows athwart the glittering waves. There was life
        and motion everywhere, and yet everywhere there was a hush,
        a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret
        enterprises of bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in
        moonbeams and half in mysterious shadows, the grim old
        mansions of the Republic seemed to have an expression about
        them of having an eye out for just such enterprises as
        these at that same moment. Music came floating over the
        waters--Venice was complete.</p>

        <p>It was a beautiful picture--very soft and dreamy and
        beautiful. But what was this Venice to compare with the
        Venice of midnight? Nothing. There was a f&ecirc;te--a
        grand f&ecirc;te in honor of some saint who had been
        instrumental in checking the cholera three hundred years
        ago, and all Venice was abroad on the water. It was no
        common affair, for the Venetians did not know how soon they
        might need the saint's services again, now that the cholera
        was spreading every where. So in one vast space--say a
        third of a mile wide and two miles long--were collected two
        thousand gondolas, and every one of them had from two to
        ten, twenty and even thirty colored lanterns suspended
        about it, and from four to a dozen occupants. Just as far
        as the eye could reach, these painted lights were massed
        together--like a vast garden of many-colored flowers,
        except that these blossoms were never still; they were
        ceaselessly gliding in and out, and mingling together, and
        seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazy
        evolutions. Here and there a strong red, green, or blue
        glare from a rocket that was struggling to get away,
        splendidly illuminated all the boats around it. Every
        gondola that swam by us, with its crescents and pyramids
        and circles of colored lamps hung aloft, and lighting up
        the faces of the young and the sweet-scented and lovely
        below, was a picture; and the reflections of those lights,
        so long, so slender, so numberless, so many-colored and so
        distorted and wrinkled by the waves, was a picture
        likewise, and one that was enchantingly beautiful. Many and
        many a party of young ladies and gentlemen had their state
        gondolas handsomely decorated, and ate supper on board,
        bringing their swallow-tailed, white-cravatted varlets to
        wait upon them, and having their tables tricked out as if
        for a bridal supper. They had brought along the costly
        globe lamps from their drawing-rooms, and the lace and
        silken curtains from the same places, I suppose. And they
        had also brought pianos and guitars, and they played and
        sang operas, while the plebeian paper-lanterned gondolas
        from the suburbs and the back alleys crowded around to
        stare and listen.</p>
