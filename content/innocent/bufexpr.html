          <p>If any book of late years has so generally interested
          the press of the country and received so extensive and
          favorable an introduction to the public as has Mark
          Twain's <i>Innocents Abroad,</i> since its appearance, we
          fail to remember the instance. We gave to our readers
          last week, in a supplementary sheet, some specimens of
          the notices we have found in our exchanges. Numerous as
          were the excerpts here collected, they represent but a
          fraction of what have fallen under our observation, and
          the notable fact is, that, instead of the mere mention so
          commonly accorded to a new book, almost every journal has
          given it an unusually elaborate review, written not in a
          simple spirit of courtesy, but evidentally with an
          inspiration of interest excited by reading the work. The
          truth is, we believe, that no one of an ordinary
          disposition of mind can dip into the volume without being
          snared by a curious fascination. It is so different from
          any narrative of travel that ever was written before. The
          mere tickle of an ever pervading humor is not all that
          makes it delightful, but that humor is like an
          atmosphere, in which the old world scenes that so many
          tourists and travellers have led us into, take on a new
          and altogether novel appearance, so that we follow our
          droll excursionist from place to place as eagerly as
          though we had never been carried to them by any narrative
          before. It would be a great mistake to suppose that the
          book is just a big package of Mark Twain's jokes, to be
          read with laughter, and for the sake of laughter. It is
          the panorama of Europe and the Holy Land as they were
          seen by one who went abroad with no illusions; who
          carried about with him a shrewd pair of American eyes,
          and used them to get his own impressions of things, as
          they actually presented themselves, not as he had been
          taught to expect them; who bore with him, moreover, as
          acute an appreciation of sham and humbug as his sense of
          the humorous and ludicrous was keen. What he saw he
          tells, and we believe there is more true description in
          his book than in any other of the kind that we have read.
          What is to be told soberly he tells soberly, and with all
          the admiration or reverence that is due to the subject.
          But he does like to wash off false colors, to scrape away
          putty and varnish, to stick a pin into venerable moss
          grown shams -- and it is a perpetual delight to his
          reader to see him do it in his droll, dry way. We have
          yet to find the person who could open the book and
          willingly lay it down again, for, certainly, it is not
          often that more or livelier entertainment can be had in
          the same compass. The work has been published by the
          American Publishing Company, at Hartford, and is sold by
          agents who canvass for subscriptions.</p>
