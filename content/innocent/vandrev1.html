  <h1>The Cleveland Herald<br />
  18 November 1868</h1>

  <p>[<i>The first of the three Cleveland reviews was written by
  Mrs. Mary Fairbanks, the wife of the publisher of the</i>
  Herald<i>, and the woman MT addressed as "Mother." He met her on
  the</i> Quaker City <i>trip, and almost immediately put himself
  up for adoption as her "Prodigal Son." He premiered the "American
  Vandal" lecture in Cleveland so that his lecture tour could begin
  under her auspices. The review she wrote was apparently very
  influential in convincing other midwestern towns to engage MT as
  a lecturer.</i>]</p>

  <p>The course of lectures before the Library Association was
  inaugurated last evening by the brilliant entertainment of the
  humorist "Mark Twain." Notwithstanding the unpropitious weather,
  and strong competition of counter attractions in the way of
  amusements, Case Hall was early filled with an assembly who were
  prepared to criticize closely this new candidate for their favor.
  A few moments sufficed to put him and his audience on the best of
  terms, and to warm him up with the pleasant consciousness of
  their approval. For nearly two hours he held them by the
  magnetism of his varied talent.</p>

  <p>We shall attempt no transcript of his lecture, lest with
  unskillful hands we mar its beauty, for beauty and poetry it
  certainly possessed, though the production of a profound
  humorist.</p>

  <p>We know not which to commend, the quaint utterances, the funny
  incidents, the good-natured recital of the characteristics of the
  harmless "Vandal," or the gems of beautiful descriptions which
  sparkled all through his lecture. We expected to be amused, but
  we were taken by surprise when he carried us on the wings of his
  redundant fancy, away to the ruins, the cathedrals, and the
  monuments of the Old World. There are some passages of gorgeous
  word painting which haunt us like a remembered picture.</p>

  <p>We congratulate Mr. Twain upon having taken the tide of public
  favor "at the flood" in the lecture field, and having
  conclusively proved that a man may be a humorist without being a
  clown. He has elevated his profession by his graceful delivery
  and by recognizing in his audience something higher than merely a
  desire to laugh. We can assure the cities who await his coming
  that a rich feast is in store for them and Cleveland is proud to
  offer him the first laurel leaf, in his role as lecturer this
  side of the "Rocky-slope."</p>

  <p>The most popular American humorist since the demise of poor
  Artemus, made his first bow to a Cleveland public, as a lecturer,
  last evening, at Case Hall. Mark Twain has reason to feel a
  gratified pride at the pleasant and satisfactory impression he
  made upon his immense audience. The "American Vandal Abroad" was
  the title of a slightly incoherent address of between one and two
  hour's duration -- mingling the most irresistible humor with
  little flights of eloquence, and making up an entertainment of
  which it were impossible to tire. The "Vandal" was the type of
  careless, dry, Yankee tourist, who never lost his equanimity, or
  coolness, no matter what his situation might be. He looked at a
  manuscript of Christopher Columbus, with the most infernal sang
  froid -- remarking that it didn't amount to much as a specimen of
  penmanship; there were school boys in his country, who could beat
  it. The vandal, in order that he may the better appreciate
  Columbus, is told by the guide that he discovered America. "Guess
  not," says he, "I have just come from America, and I heard
  nothing about it!" He examines a mummy. To the guide -- "What did
  I understand you to say was the name of the gentleman?" The guide
  perspires, and explains that the diseased died some 3,000 years
  ago. "Ah," sighs the vandal, "are his parents living?" The Vandal
  is an untiring relic hunter. He got along very well till he
  arrive in the Crimea; there relics were scarce. He finally found
  the hip bone of a horse, on the field of the Alma, however, which
  was gobbled up and labeled -- "Jawbone of a Russian general." The
  apostrophe to the Sphinx was really beautiful; and when the
  speaker would up with a sketch of the imperturbable Vandal who so
  coolly whistled in its shade, the house "came down["]. We have
  given two or three "specimen bricks." Mr. Clemmen's manner very
  much enhanced the effect of his remarks -- there is a dry,
  comical drawl in his voice, that is irresistible in a funny
  story. He should speak louder, however; those in the rear of the
  hall lost many of his good things.</p>

  <p>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font>. -- A
  very large audience assembled in Case Hall last evening to hear
  Mark Twain lecture. It is a dangerous thing for a man who has
  made a reputation as a writer to enter the field of lecturing,
  but as Mr. Clemens' manner corresponds completely with his dry,
  off-hand style of wit he has perhaps suffered nothing in
  reputation by appearing before the lecture-going poet [sic] as a
  candidate for its plaudits. His subject was the "American Vandal
  Abroad," and he portrayed the <i>nonchalance</i>, dignity and
  independence of that large class of Americans traveling in
  Europe, and known at home as "shoddy," with truth and in a
  humorous way. The discourse, however, was not altogether
  facetious. At times there were passages which were grand indeed
  and in the delivery of which the lecturer became eloquent. The
  lecture course of the literary association has thus had a most
  auspicious beginning and we hope to see every entertainment as
  liberally patronized. Next week Mr. J. E. Murdoch, the celebrated
  elocutionist, will give some miscellaneous readings.</p>
