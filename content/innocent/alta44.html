        <p>It is a singular circumstance that right under the roof
        of this same great church, and not far away from that
        illustrious column, old Adam, the father of the human race,
        lies buried. There is no question that he is actually
        buried in the grave which is pointed out as his--there can
        be none--because it has never yet been proven that the
        grave is not the grave in which he is buried. I could not
        do less than shed some tender tears over poor old Adam. I
        could not but feel how much he had lost by dying so young.
        He had not seen the telegraph, or the locomotive, or the
        steamboat; he did not even see the flood. He missed the
        Paris Exposition. There was a roughness about that that
        cannot be over-estimated. He never had to pay three dollars
        a dozen for washing, and then have somebody's shirts come
        home to him that were too right around the neck--but can a
        happiness like that atone for the suffering it must have
        cost him to have to go into company in the meagre costume
        of his time? When he first put on fig leaves he probably
        felt innocently gay; and when he finally branched out and
        got himself up regardless of expense, in a sheep-skin, he
        must have considered himself positively gorgeous. But think
        of Adam, with that skin and his long patriarchal beard, and
        think of him in a claw-hammer coat, white kids, and a
        moustache. The more I reflected upon what Adam had lost in
        being taken away so early, the more I was moved and the
        more I wept. The subject is too painful for contemplation,
        even now. Let us change it.</p>[St. Helena]

        <p>In this altar they used to keep one of the most curious
        relics that human eyes ever looked upon--a thing that had
        power to fascinate the beholder in some mysterious way and
        keep him staring for hours together. It was nothing less
        than the copper plate Pilate put upon the Savior's cross,
        and upon which he wrote, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS." I
        think St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, found this
        wonderful memento when she was prospecting here in the
        third century. She was all over Palestine, and she had a
        run of luck the like of which was never seen before or
        since. Whenever she found a thing mentioned in her Bible,
        Old or New, she would take her umbrella and start out after
        that thing and never, never stop until she found it. If it
        was Adam, she would find Adam; if it was the Ark, she would
        find the Ark; if it was Goliah, or Joshua or Exodus, or any
        of those parties, she would find <i>them</i>; if it was a
        cup of a saint, or the handkerchief of the Virgin, or a
        painting by St. Luke, a man could risk his shekels that she
        would raise them; there was not anything she couldn't find.
        She was starting after Moses when she died; Moses is not
        found yet. And as for martyrs--why, martyrs were her strong
        suit, as you might say. She could start a martyr any time.
        She was pretty much always turning up a martyr somewhere,
        and dividing him up among the churches--a leg to this great
        cathedral, an arm to that, the body to the third, and so
        on, and the toe-nails she gave to the small fry. She meant
        well, of course, but then she has those martyrs divided up
        and scattered around so, that fragments of different ones
        have got mixed together, and there is going to be trouble
        some day on account of it. She was a most remarkable woman,
        and very impartial about martyrs.</p>

        <p>She did her best here on Calvary, no doubt. She had a
        claim here that she worked as long as she lived, and always
        had reason to be satisfied with it. She found the
        inscription here that I was speaking of, I think. She found
        it in this very spot, close to where the martyred Roman
        soldier stood. It is but just to say that the circumstance
        aroused no suspicion concerning the soldier. That copper
        plate is in one of the churches in Rome, now. I have seen
        it there. The inscription is very distinct. It is written
        in English, Italian and Spanish. This fact proves its
        authenticity, because these languages were not known in
        Pilate's time.</p>
