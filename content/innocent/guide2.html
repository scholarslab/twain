        <p>[<i>from the section on Milan</i>] "<i>The Last
        Supper</i>," by Leonardo da Vinci, is in the former
        refectory of the Dominican Convent attached to Santa Maria.
        It has suffered much from dampness, injudicious attempts at
        restoration, and other ill usage. "At the time that Milan
        was in the possession of Napoleon, this convent was
        converted into barracks, and as the refrectory became a
        stable for the calvary horses, the already mutilated
        painting received still further injury. Many anecdotes are
        related of Leonardo da Vinci during the progress of his
        picture. It is said that the head of our Saviour was left
        unfinished; the artist, having invested the countenance of
        the disciple John with a beauty almost divine, shrank from
        portraying the mingled emotions of him whose heart was full
        of grief, knowing as he did that in the band of his beloved
        disciples there was one who had proved a traitor."</p>

        <p>"The purpose being the decoration of a refectory in a
        rich convent, the chamber lofty and spacious, Leonardo has
        adopted the usual arrangement: the table runs across from
        side to side, filling up the whole extent of the wall, and
        the figures, being above the eye, and to be viewed from a
        distance, are colossal; they would otherwise have appeared
        smaller than the real personages seated at the tables
        below. The moment selected is the utterance of the words,
        'Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall
        betray me;' or rather, the words have just been uttered,
        and the picture expresses their effect on the different
        auditors. The intellectual elevation, the fineness of
        nature, the benign god-like dignity, suffused with the
        profoundest sorrow, in the head of Christ, surpassed all I
        could have conceived as possible in art; and faded as it
        is, the character there, being stamped on it by the soul,
        not the hand, of the artist, will remain while a line or
        hue remains visible. It is a divine shadow, and until it
        fades into nothing, and disappears into nothing, will have
        the lineaments of divinity...." -- <i>Jameson</i>.</p>

        <p>"Leonardo said that he had meditated for two whole years
        how best to portray on a human face the working of the
        perfidious heart of Judas; it is believed that he took for
        his model the prior of the convent, his bitter and
        malicious enemy." [pp. 617-18]</p>

        <p>[<i>from the section on Rome</i>] We have now reached
        the COLISEUM or the Flavian Amphitheatre. It was commence
        by Vespasian, on his return from his war against the Jews,
        continued, and dedicated by his eldest son Titus,
        <font size="-1">A.D.</font> 80, and completed by his
        youngest son, Domitian, who succeeded Titus. . . . The
        aesthetic impression is that produced by massiveness and
        magnitude, and is well expressed in the quotation made use
        of by Byron: --</p>

        <p>"While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;<br />
        When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;<br />
        And when Rome falls, the world."</p>

        <p>It is, by common consent, the grandest ruin of old Rome.
        The cause of its dilapidation cannot be better described
        than in the same writer's words: --</p>

        <p>"Arches on arches! as it were that Rome,<br />
        Collecting the chief trophies of her line,<br />
        Would build up all her triumphs in one dome....</p>

        <p>The <i>arena</i>, or space where the shows were
        exhibited, derived its name from the <i>sand</i> with
        which, on account of the number of wild beasts slain there,
        it was found necessary to strew it. Hence the word was
        afterwards used, not unfrequently, to denote the
        amphitheatre itself, and a gladiator was sometimes called
        <i>arenarius</i>. The arena was surrounded by a wall (still
        nearly entire) carried to a height sufficient to prevent
        the wild beasts from leaping over it. . . .</p>

        <p>Every nation has its vices, and cruelty seems to have
        been the vice of Rome. It is said, indeed, that the truly
        brave are never cruel; but to that assertion the Flavian
        amphitheatre gives the lie. "Here sat the conquerors of the
        world coolly to enjoy the tortures and the death of men who
        had never offended them;" of men --</p>

        <p>"Spared but to die, a public spectacle,<br />
        In combat with each other, and required<br />
        To fall with grace, with dignity, -- to sink<br />
        While life is gushing, and the plaudits ring<br />
        Faint and yet fainter on their falling ear,<br />
        As models for the sculptor." -- R<font size=
        "-1">OGERS</font>.</p>

        <p>"Two aqueducts were scarcely sufficient to wash off the
        human blood which a few hours' sport shed in this Imperial
        shambles. Twice in one day came the senators and matrons of
        Rome to the butchery; a virgin always gave the signal for
        slaughter." [pp. 693-95]</p>
        <hr width="60%" />

        <p>[<i>from the section on
        Constaninople</i>]Constantinople, called by the Turks
        Stamboul or Istamboul, was originally called Byzantium. . .
        . The city itself is built on hilly ground, and from this
        circumstance its numerous gardens, mosques, palaces,
        minarets, and towers, present a magnificent appearance from
        the Golden Horn. The scenery of the Thracian Bosphorus is
        of almost unrivalled beauty.</p>

        <p>A nearer approach to Constantinople reveals the
        characteristics of an Eastern town: narrow, filthy streets,
        and miserable houses. . . . The population of
        Constantinople in 1873 was 750,000, of whom about one-half
        were Mahomedans, one-fourth Greeks, and the rest Armenians,
        Franks, and Jews. . . .</p>

        <p>"It would be difficult for any imagination to associate
        in close array all the incongruous and discordant objects
        which may be contemplated in an hour's walk in
        Constantinople. The barbarous extremes of magnificence and
        wretchedness, and the majesty of nature, crowned with all
        the grandeur of art in contrast with the atrocious effects
        of unrestrained sensuality, fill up the varied picture. The
        howling of ten thousand dogs re-echoing through the streets
        all the live-long night, chases you betimes from your
        pillow. Approaching your window you are greeted by the rays
        of the rising sun, gilding the snowy summits of Mount
        Olympus . . ."</p>
