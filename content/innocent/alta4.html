        <p>I have caught a glimpse of the faces of several Moorish
        women (for they are only human, and will expose their faces
        for the admiration of a Christian dog when no he-Moor is
        by,) and I am full of veneration for the wisdom that leads
        them to cover up such atrocious ugliness. If I had a wife
        as ugly as some of those I have seen, I would go over her
        face with a nail-grab and see if I couldn't improve it.</p>

        <p>They carry their children at their backs, in a sack,
        like other savages the world over.</p>

        <p>Many of the negroes are held in slavery by the Moors.
        But the moment a female slave becomes her master's
        concubine her bonds are broken, and as soon as a male slave
        can read the first chapter of the Koran (which contains the
        creed) he can no longer be held in bondage. It would be a
        good idea to apply this educational test to his race in
        America.</p>
