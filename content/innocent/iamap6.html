        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rome</h2><br />

        <p>In all seriousness--without meaning to be
        frivolous--without meaning to be irreverent, and more than
        all, without meaning to be blasphemous,--I state as my
        simple deduction from the things I have seen and the things
        I have heard, that the Holy Personages rank thus in
        Rome:</p>

        <p><i>First</i>--"The Mother of God"--otherwise the Virgin
        Mary.</p>

        <p><i>Second</i>--The Deity.</p>

        <p><i>Third</i>--Peter.</p>

        <p><i>Fourth</i>--Some twelve or fifteen canonized Popes
        and martyrs.</p>

        <p><i>Fifth</i>--Jesus Christ the Saviour--(but always as
        an infant in arms.)</p>

        <p>I may be wrong in this--my judgment errs often, just as
        is the case with other men's--but it <i>is</i> my judgment,
        be it good or bad.</p>

        <p>Just here I will mention something that seems curious to
        me. There are no "Christ's Churches" in Rome, and no
        "Churches of the Holy Ghost," that I can discover. There
        are some four hundred churches, but about a fourth of them
        seem to be named for the Madonna and St. Peter. There are
        so many named for Mary that they have to be distinguished
        by all sorts of affixes, if I understand the matter
        rightly. Then we have churches of St. Louis; St. Augustine;
        St. Agnes; St. Calixtus; St. Lorenzo in Lucina; St. Lorenzo
        in Damaso; St. Cecilia; St. Athanasius; St. Philip Neri;
        St. Catherine, St. Dominico, and a multitude of lesser
        saints whose names are not familiar in the world--and away
        down, clear out of the list of the churches, comes a couple
        of hospitals: one of them is named for the Saviour and the
        other for the Holy Ghost!</p>

        <p>Day after day and night after night we have wandered
        among the crumbling wonders of Rome; day after day and
        night after night we have fed upon the dust and decay of
        five-and-twenty centuries--have brooded over them by day
        and dreampt of them by night till sometimes we seemed
        moldering away ourselves, and growing defaced and
        cornerless, and liable at any moment to fall a prey to some
        antiquary and be patched in the legs, and "restored" with
        an unseemly nose, and labeled wrong and dated wrong, and
        set up in the Vatican for poets to drivel about and vandals
        to scribble their names on forever and forevermore.</p>

        <p>But the surest way to stop writing about Rome is to
        stop. I wished to write a real "guide-book" chapter on this
        fascinating city, but I could not do it, because I have
        felt all the time like a boy in a candy-shop--there was
        every thing to choose from, and yet no choice. I have
        drifted along hopelessly for a hundred pages of manuscript
        without knowing where to commence. I will not commence at
        all. Our passports have been examined. We will go to
        Naples.</p><br clear="right" />
