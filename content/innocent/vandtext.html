        <p>[<i>There is no definitive text of a MT lecture. For the
        "American Vandal" he followed his usual practice of writing
        it out and committing it to memory, but in performance it
        was a living thing. In essence it remained the same
        throughout the 1868-1869 tour, but on any given night he
        could make it longer or shorter, try out new ideas, and so
        on. The version below is Albert Bigelow Paine's, from</i>
        Mark Twain's Speeches <i>; other versions can be found in
        Fred W. Lorch's</i> Trouble Begins At Eight <i>and Paul
        Fatout's</i> Mark Twain Speaking<i>. Paine's is the
        shortest, probably about half as long as any talk MT
        delivered, and the least humorous. Like Mrs. Fairbanks,
        Paine obviously preferred what MT called "the serious
        passages." These moments were important to contemporary
        audiences, who wanted to feel "improved" or "instructed" or
        "uplifted" in the lyceum, but MT's great popularity as a
        speaker came from his humor. To see examples of the kinds
        of passages audiences laughed at, but Paine minimized, the
        text below has links to a couple additional passages -- the
        first from Fatout's, the second from Lorch's versions of
        the lecture.</i>]</p>

        <p>I am to speak of the American Vandal this evening, but I
        wish to say in advance that I do not use this term in
        derision or apply it as a reproach, but I use it because it
        is convenient; and duly and properly modified, it best
        describes the roving, independent, free-and-easy character
        of that class of traveling Americans who are <i>not</i>
        elaborately educated, cultivated, and refined, and gilded
        and filigreed with the ineffable graces of the first
        society. The best class of our countrymen who go abroad
        keep us well posted about their doings in foreign lands,
        but their brethren vandals cannot sing their own praises or
        publish their adventures.</p>

        <p>The American Vandal gallops over England, Scotland,
        Spain, and Switzerland, and finally brings up in Italy. He
        thinks it is the proper thing to visit Genoa, the stately
        old City of Palaces, whose vast marble edifices almost meet
        together over streets so narrow that three men can hardly
        walk abreast in them, and so crooked that a man generally
        comes out of them about the same place he went in. He only
        stays in Genoa long enough to see a few celebrated things
        and get some fragments of stone from the house Columbus was
        born in -- for your genuine Vandal is an intolerable and
        incorrigible relic gatherer. It is estimated that if all
        the fragments of stone brought from Columbus's house by
        travelers were collected together they would suffice to
        build a house fourteen thousand feet high -- and I suppose
        they would.</p>

        <p>Next he hurries to Milan and takes notes of the Grand
        Cathedral (for he is alwlays taking notes). Oh, I remember
        Milan and the noble cathedral well enough -- that marble
        miracle of enchanting architecture. I remember how we
        entered and walked about its vast spaces and among its huge
        columns, gazing aloft at the monster windows all aglow with
        brilliantly colored scenes in the life of the Savior and
        his followers. And I remember the side-shows and
        curiosities there, too. The guide showed us a
        coffee-colored piece of sculpture which he said was
        supposed to have come from the hand of Phidias, since it
        was not possible that any other man, of any epoch, could
        have copied nature with such faultless accuracy. The figure
        was that of a man without a skin; with every vein, artery,
        muscle, every fiber and tendon and tissue of the human
        frame, represented in minute detail. It looked natural,
        because it looked somehow <i>as if it were in pain</i>. A
        skinned man <i>would be likely to look that way</i> --
        unless his attention were occupied by some other
        matter.</p>

        <p>The Vandal goes to see the ancient and most celebrated
        painting in the world, "The Last Supper." We all know it in
        engravings: the disciples all sitting on one side of a
        long, plain table and Christ with bowed head in the center
        -- all the last suppers in the world are copied from this
        painting. It is so damaged now, by the wear and tear of
        three hundred years, that the figures can hardly be
        distinguished. The Vandal goes to see this picture -- which
        all the world praises -- looks at it with a critical eye,
        and says it's a perfect old nightmare of a picture and he
        wouldn't give forty dollars for a million like it (and I
        indorse his opinion), and then he is done with Milan.</p>

        <p>He paddles around the Lake of Como for a few days, and
        then takes the cars. He is bound for Venice, the oldest and
        the proudest and the princeliest republic that ever graced
        the earth. We put on a good many airs with our little
        infant of a Republic of a century's growth, but we grow
        modest when we stand before this gray, old imperial city
        that used to laugh the armies and navies of half the world
        to scorn, and was a haughty, invincible, magnificent
        Republic for fourteen hundred years! The Vandal is bound
        for Venice! He has a long, long, weary ride of it; but just
        as the day is closing he hears some one shout, "Venice!"
        and puts his head out of a window, and sure enough, afloat
        on the placid sea, a league away, lies the great city with
        its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden mist
        of sunset!</p>

        <p>Have you been to Venice, and seen the winding canals,
        and the stately edifices that border them all along,
        ornamented with the quaint devices and sculptures of a
        former age? And have you seen the great Cathedral of St.
        Mark's -- and the Giant's Staircase -- and the famous
        Bridge of Sighs -- and the great Square of St. Mark's --
        and the ancient pillar with the winged lion of St. Mark

        <p>I had begun to feel that the old Venice of song and
        story had departed forever. But I was too hasty. When we
        swept gracefully out into the Grand Canal and under the
        mellow moonlight the Venice of poetry and romance stood
        revealed. Right from the water's edge rose palaces of
        marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly hither and thither
        and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and
        alleys; ponderous stone bridges threw their shadows athwart
        the glittering waves. There were life and motion
        everywhere, and yet everywhere there was a hush, a stealthy
        sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret
        enterprises of bravos and of lovers; and clad half in
        moonbeams and half in mysterious shadows, the grim old
        mansions of the republic seemed to have an expression about
        them of having an eye out for just such enterprises as
        these. At that same moment music came stealing over the
        waters -- Venice was complete.</p>

        <p><i>Our</i> Vandals hurried away from Venice and
        scattered abroad everywhere. You could find them breaking
        specimens from the dilapidated tomb of Romeo and Juliet at
        Padua -- and infesting the picture galleries of Florence --
        and risking their necks on the Leaning Tower of Pisa -- and
        snuffing sulphur fumes on the summit of Vesuvius -- and
        burrowing among the exhumed wonders of Herculaneum and
        Pompeii -- and you might see them with spectacles on, and
        blue cotton umbrellas under their arms, benignantly
        contemplating Rome from the venerable arches of the
        Coliseum.</p>

        <p>And finally we sailed from Naples, and in due time
        anchored before the Piraeus, the seaport of Athens in
        Greece. But the quarantine was in force, and so they set a
        guard of soldiers to watch us and would not let us go
        ashore. However, I and three other Vandals took a boat, and
        muffled the oars, and slipped ashore at 11.30 at night, and
        dodged the guard successfully. Then we made a wide circuit
        around the slumbering town, avoiding all roads and houses
        -- for they'd about as soon hang a body as not for
        violating the quarantine laws in those countries. We got
        around the town without any accident, and then struck out
        across the Attic Plain, steering straight for Athens --
        over rocks and hills and brambles and everything -- with
        Mt. Helicon for a landmark. And so we tramped for five or
        six miles. The Attic Plain is a mighty uncomfortable plain
        to travel in, even if it <i>is</i> so historical. The armed
        guards got after us three times and flourished their
        gleaming gun barrels in the moonlight, because they thought
        we were stealing grapes occasionally -- and the fact is we
        <i>were</i> -- for we found by and by that the brambles
        that tripped us up so often were grape-vines -- but these
        people in the country didn't know that we were
        quarantine-blockade runners, and so they only scared us and
        jawed Greek at us, and let us go, instead of arresting
        us.</p>

        <p>We didn't care about Athens particularly, but we wanted
        to see the famous Acropolis and its ruined temples, and we
        did. We climbed the steep hill of the Acropolis about one
        in the morning and tried to storm that grand old fortress
        that had scorned the battles and sieges of three thousand
        years. We had the garrison out mighty quick -- four Greeks
        -- and we bribed them to betray the citadel and unlock the
        gates. In a moment we stood in the presence of the noblest
        ruins we had ever seen -- the most elegant, the most
        graceful, the most imposing. The renowned Parthenon towered
        above us, and about us were the wreck of what were once the
        snowy marble Temples of Hercules and Minerva, and another
        whose name I have forgotten. Most of the Parthenon's grand
        columns are still standing, but the roof is gone.</p>

        <p>As we wandered down the marble-paved length of this
        mighty temple, the scene was strangely impressive. Here and
        there in lavish profusion were gleaming white statues of
        men and women, propped against blocks of marble, some of
        them armless, some without legs, others headless, but all
        looking mournful and sentient and startlingly human! They
        rose up and confronted the midnight intruder on every side;
        they stared at him with stony eyes from unlooked-for nooks
        and recesses; they peered at him over fragmentary heaps far
        down the desolate corridors; they barred his way in the
        midst of the broad forum, and solemnly pointed with
        handless arms the way from the sacred fane; and through the
        roofless temple the moon looked down and banded the floor
        and darkened the scattered fragments and broken statues
        with the slanting shadows of the columns!</p>

        <p>What a world of ruined sculpture was about us! Stood up
        in rows, stacked up in piles, scattered broadcast over the
        wide area of the Acropolis, were hundreds of crippled
        statues of all sizes and of the most exquisite
        worksmanship; and vast fragments of marble that once
        belonged to the entablatures, covered with bas-reliefs
        representing battles and sieges, ships of war with three
        and four tiers of oars, pageants and processions --
        everything one could think of.</p>

        <p>We walked out into the grass-grown, fragment-strewn
        court beyond the Parthenon. It startled us every now and
        then, to see a stony white face stare suddenly up at us out
        of the grass, with its dead eyes. The place seemed alive
        with ghosts. We half expected to see the Athenian heroes of
        twenty centuries ago glide out of the shadows and steal
        into the old temple they knew so well and regarded with
        such boundless pride.</p>

        <p>The full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens
        now. We sauntered carelessly and unthinkingly to the edge
        of the lofty battlements of the citadel, and looked down,
        and, lo! a vision! And such a vision! Athens by moonlight!
        All the beauty in all the world could not rival it! The
        prophet that thought the splendors of the New Jerusalem
        were revealed to him, surely saw this instead. It lay in
        the level plain right under our feet -- all spread abroad
        like a picture -- and we looked down upon it as we might
        have looked from a balloon. We saw no semblance of a
        street, but every house, every window, every clinging vine,
        every projection, was as distinct and sharply marked as if
        the time were noonday; and yet there was no glare, no
        glitter, nothing harsh or repulsive -- the silent city was
        flooded with the mellowest light that ever streamed from
        the moon, and seemed like some living creature wrapped in
        peaceful slumber. On its father side was a little temple
        whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich
        luster that chained the eye like a spell; and, nearer by,
        the palace of the king reared its creamy walls out of the
        midst of a great garden of shrubbery that was flecked all
        over with a random shower of amber lights -- a spray of
        golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of
        the moon and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage
        like the pallid stars of the Milky Way! Overhead, the
        stately columns, majestic still in their ruin; underfoot,
        the dreaming city; in the distance the silver sea -- not on
        the broad earth is there another picture half so
        beautiful!</p>

        <p>We got back to the ship safely, just as the day was
        dawning. We had walked upon pavements that had been pressed
        by Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Socrates, Phocion,
        Euclid, Xenophon, Herodotus, Diogenes, and a hundred others
        of deathless fame, and were satisfied. We got to stealing
        grapes again on the way back, and half a dozen rascally
        guards with muskets and pistols captured us and marched us
        in the center of a hollow square nearly to the sea -- till
        we were beyond all the graperies. Military escort -- ah, I
        never travelled in so much state in all my life.</p>

        farther -- not <i>our</i> Vandals to Constantinople and
        Smyrna and the Holy Land, Egypt, the islands of the sea,
        and to Russia and his visit to the emperor. But I wish I

        <p>In closing these remarks I will observe that I could
        have said more about the American Vandal abroad, and less
        about other things, but I found that he had too many
        disagreeable points about him, and so I thought I would
        touch him lightly and let him go.</p>

        <p>If there is a moral to this lecture it is an injunction
        to all Vandals to <i>travel</i>. I am glad the American
        Vandal <i>goes</i> abroad. It does him good. It makes a
        better man of him. It rubs out a multitude of his old
        unworthy biases and prejudices. It aids his religion, for
        it enlarges his charity and his benevolence, it broadens
        his views of men and things; it deepens his generosity and
        his compassion for the failings and shortcomings of his
        fellow creatures. Contact with men of various nations and
        many creeds teaches him that there are <i>other</i> people
        in the world besides his own little clique, and other
        opinions as worthy of attention and respect as his own. He
        finds that he and <i>his</i> are not the most momentous
        matters in the universe. Cast into trouble and misfortune
        in strange lands and being mercifully cared for by those he
        never saw before, he begins to learn that best lesson of
        all -- that one which culminates in the conviction that God
        puts <i>something</i> good and something lovable in every
        man his hands create -- that the world is <i>not</i> a
        cold, harsh, cruel, prison-house, stocked with all manner
        of selfishness and hate and wickedness. It
        <i>liberalizes</i> the Vandal to travel. You never saw a
        bigoted, opionated, stubborn, narrow-minded,
        self-conceited, <i>almighty mean man</i> in your life but
        he had stuck in one place ever since he was born and
        thought God made the world and dyspepsia and bile for
        <i>his</i> especial comfort and satisfaction. So I say,
        <i>by all means</i> let the American Vandal go on
        traveling, and let no man discourage him.</p>
