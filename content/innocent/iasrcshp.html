        <p>MT was as much a <i>re</i>-writer as a writer.
        Throughout his career he depended heavily on other books --
        pre-texts -- to shape both his humorous and his realist
        agendas. In many places <i>Innocents Abroad</i> burlesques
        or parodies earlier sentimental or romantic narratives, and
        throughout it is defined as an attempt to revise previous
        accounts of the Old World, to show American readers Europe
        and the Holy Land as they really are, and not as various
        books have depicted them.</p>

        <p>Thus MT's first book has many "sources." As a travel
        narrative, for example, its origins could be traced as far
        back as Irving's account of an American going back east in
        <i>The Sketch-Book</i> -- or even further. Here, however,
        are included only a few of the more significant
        contemporary texts with which MT's book is in dialogue.</p>

        <p>Although by far the most popular, <i>Innocents</i> was
        not the first humorous account of travel to the Old World.
        <i>Yusef; or the Journey of the Frangi</i>, published in
        1853 by J. Ross Browne, is about comic misadventures in the
        Holy Land. MT knew this Browne, but he was more deeply
        indebted to the travel accounts of Charles Farrar Browne --
        better known as Artemus Ward. In 1866, "Ward" was in
        England, lecturing on his experiences among the same
        Western scenes MT would write about in <i>Roughing It</i>
        (see Mark Twain on Stage). While there, he published eight
        letters in the comic magazine <i>Punch</i> about the way
        the sites and shrines of England looked to him. Like a lot
        of American humorists before MT, Ward partly relied for
        laughs on komik mishspellin, but the kinds of <a name="a"
        id="a">American innocence</a> his pilgrim embodies
        certainly helped MT define his own character:</p>

        <p>Most American accounts of the Old World, though, were
        not humorous, but rather serious -- even solemn and
        reverent. One of the most popular 19th-century American
        travel writers was Bayard Taylor. He died in 1878, but
        multi-volume editions of his travel books continued to be
        brought out throughout MT's career. In <i>Views A-Foot</i>
        (1855) Taylor covers much the same ground as MT in
        <i>Innocents</i> , but as (to use <a name="b" id="b">the
        label</a> he gave himself) a "sentimental traveler":</p>

        <p>As MT notes in the opening chapters of <i>Innocents</i>,
        by the end of the Civil War the number of Americans going
        to the Old World grew dramatically. Whereas earlier
        travelers had to rely on European guidebooks like Murray's
        and Baedeker's, by 1860 there were a number of guidebooks
        written specifically by and for Americans abroad. Two of
        the most popular were <i>Harper's</i> and
        <i>Appleton's</i>. As MT complains throughout
        <i>Innocents</i> , such books not only told Americans what
        to see in places like <a name="c" id="c">Paris or Rome</a>,
        but also what to feel and what to say about what they
        saw:</p>

        <p>Most Americans going to the Old World were, in one sense
        or other, pilgrims. But the special destination of the
        <i>Quaker City</i>, the main feature of its program, was
        the Holy Land. In a passage written for the <i>Alta</i>,
        but deleted for <i>Innocents</i>, MT lists eight
        contemporary books about Palestine that the <i>Quaker
        City</i> passengers were encouraged to bring with them on
        the trip, as appropriate guides to the sacred realm they
        were about to enter. Two such books are represented here,
        including Prime's <i>Tent Life</i>, the traveler that MT
        <a name="d" id="d">quotes and derides</a> (as "Grimes") in
        <i>his</i> account of the Holy Land:</p>

        <p><i>Innocents Abroad</i> offers one kind of record of the way MT read others' representations of travel through the Old World.  In the summer of  2011, when Mallory Howard, Curatorial Associate at the Mark Twain House &amp; Museum, Hartford, discovered that the copy of William G. Prime's <i>Boat Life in Egypt and Nubia</i> in their library contained over a dozen handwritten comments by MT, we gained access another record of that reading experience.  Thanks to the efforts of Patti Philippon, Chief Curator, and the generosity of the Mark Twain House, we can look over MT's shoulder as he read Prime's book, sharing his reader responses.  These range from angry contempt to playful disparagement, as you can see for yourself:</p>
