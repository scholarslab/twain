  <p><font size="+1">"I</font> <font size="-1">MIGHT</font> come to
  grief?"</p>

  <p>"You might."</p>

  <p>"Roll over a precipice perhaps, and break my neck?"</p>

  <p>"Well; that's so. Your temper might be tried in that way. The
  roads over the Sierra are pretty rough just now, and we are
  likely to have ugly weather."</p>

  <p>"Then, I think the game is hardly worth the candle, my friend.
  No riding over the mountains alone for me. Besides, what would
  there be to see when I got to Nevada?"</p>

  <p>"You would see the big silver mines."</p>

  <p>"I have seen the Mexican ones. They were large enough for me.
  Is there anything else to repay me for the journey?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You would see <i>Mark Twain</i>."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I will go."</p>

  <p>The foregoing is, as nearly as I can remember, an abstract of
  a conversation with a literary friend in San Francisco, towards
  the close of the year 1863. I knew that in a few months I should
  have to visit Nevada on business. Why not avail myself of a
  leisure week and ride over the Sierra to see the wonders of the
  new territory? A mountain summit 6000 feet high, snow, slippery
  paths, and very rough roads were the hindrances. But when my
  friend mentioned the name of Mark Twain the mountains grew less
  steep, the roads perfectly practicable, and the snow became white
  roses. I had read many of Mark Twain's contributions to the press
  of the Great West. I had heard numerous reports of his telents,
  his jovial wit, his social singularities, and his extreme good
  fellowship. In one of the papers I had seen him styled -- "That
  moral phenomenon, Mark Twain." Believing that a "moral
  phenomenon" would be something to see, and that the conversation
  of a man who could write so humorously would be worth listening
  to, I started for Nevada.</p>

  <p>At the town of Placerville I came to a halt. My horse -- a
  borrowed one -- did not at all care about seeing Mark Twain. He
  preferred to see a veterinary doctor. The people of Placerville
  told me that I had better make the journey in the stage-coach. I
  did so; but not till nearly two months later, when the roads were
  in better condition. Then it was that I landed myself in Virginia
  City, a terraced town, built on the side of Mount Davidson; and
  there it was that I met Mark Twain.</p>

  <p>"You will find him at the office of the <i>Territorial
  Enterprise</i>," was the direction I received.</p>

  <p>Virginia City was but a few months old. The <i>Territorial
  Enterprise</i> was a daily paper, well edited, copious in its
  information, fortunate in its advertisements, of large
  dimensions, and published every morning, where a year or two
  previous, there had been the silence of the wilderness and the
  tents of the Indian savage.</p>

  <p>The newspaper office was in C Street. Its foundations were of
  granite, its front of iron. In its basement was a saloon for
  drink, furnished with a piano, the use of which I was informed
  was "to tone down the troubled spirits of the visitors." Behind
  the drinking saloon were two of Hoe's cylinder steam-printing
  presses. On the first floor of the building were the offices of
  mining share-brokers, and a wholesale brandy store. On the second
  story were some more brokers and some attorneys, and on the third
  floor were the editorial offices of the paper. I asked for Mr.
  Mark Twain, and hearing his name mentioned, the gentleman of whom
  I was in quest called out to Mr. Wright, to whom I had addressed
  myself--</p>

  <p>"Dan, pass the gentleman into my den. The noble animal is
  here."</p>

  <p>A young man, strongly built, ruddy in complexion, his hair of
  a sunny hue, his eyes light and twinkling, in manner hearty, and
  nothing of the student about him, but very much of the miner --
  one who looked as if he could take his own part in a quarrel,
  strike a smart blow as readily as he could say a telling thing,
  bluffly jolly, brusquely cordial, off-handedly good-natured --
  such was the kind of man I found Mark Twain to be.</p>

  <p>Let it be borne in mind that from the windows of the newspaper
  office the American desert was visible; that within a radius of
  ten miles Indians were encamping amongst the sage-brush; that the
  whole city was populated with miners, adventurers, Jew traders,
  gamblers, and all the rough-and-tumble class which a mining town
  in a new territory collects together, and it will be readily
  understood that a reporter for a daily paper in such a place must
  neither go about his duties wearing light kid gloves, nor be
  fastidious about having gilt edges to his note-books. In Mark
  Twain I found the very man I had expected to see -- a flower of
  the wilderness, tinged with the colour of the soil, the man of
  thought and the man of action rolled into one, humorist and
  hard-worker, Momus in a felt hat and jack-boots. In the reporter
  of the <i>Territorial Enterprise</i> I became introduced to a
  Californian celebrity, rich in eccentricities of thought, lively
  in fancy, quaint in remark, whose residence upon the fringre of
  civilization had allowed his humour to develop without restraint,
  and his speech to be racily idiomatic.</p>

  <p>The name of M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size=
  "-1">WAIN</font> is a <i>nom de plume</i> for Mr. Samuel L.
  Clemens; whose father, Mr. Orion Clemens, held a high position in
  the territorial government of Nevada. Before visiting that
  territory Mark Twain had afforded evidence of his literary
  ability on the Californian side of the Sierra. At the time of my
  introduction to him his talents had scarcely rendered his name
  familiar to the public of Boston or New York, and his expressed
  to Artemus Ward and myself a very earnest desire to be better
  known in one of other of those cities. Artemus promised to get
  him appointed a contributor to the <i>New York Mercury</i>, a
  promise that I believe was faithfully kept.</p>

  <p>Writing of himself and his friend Dan de Quille, his
  <i>collaborateur</i> on the Nevada paper in 1863, Mark Twain
  says, in an advertisement of the <i>Territorial Enterprise</i> --
  "Our duty is to keep the universe thoroughly posted concerning
  murders and street fights and balls and threatres, and
  pack-trains, and churches, and lectures, and school-houses, and
  city military affairs, and highway robberies, and Bible
  societies, and hay waggons, and the thousand other things which
  it is within the province of local reporters to keep track of and
  magnify into undue importance for the instruction of the readers
  of a great daily newspaper. Beyond this revelation everything
  connected with these two experiments of Providence must for ever
  remain an impenetrable mystery."</p>

  <p>With the rapid development of a literature of its own,
  California offered Mark Twain increased scope for his talents. A
  series of remarkably original articles, abounding in drollery and
  grotesque humour, were contributed by him to various journals of
  San Francisco, among which were the <i>Golden Era</i>,
  <i>Californian</i>, and <i>Overland Monthly</i>, and he soon
  became transferred from the rough life of Nevada to undertake
  editorial duties in San Francisco. The tale of "The Jumping
  Frog," a capitally told and richly conceived humorous story of
  the California gold-mines, gave its author an immediate and
  widespread popularity. "The Jumping Frog" has been republished
  everywhere, and is as well known to the readers of Australia as
  it is to the literary public of London and New York. It has been
  highly praised by Mr. Tom Hood in the pages of <i>Fun</i>, and a
  friend of mine had it put into his hands by a Parsee merchant in
  Bombay, who assured him that it was the funniest thing he could
  read.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1867 an extraordinary pleasure-trip was
  projected at New York. A steamer was to leave that port in the
  summer, cross the Atlantic, make the circuit of the
  Mediterranean, stop at the principal places along the coast of
  Spain, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and Syria; the passengers
  were to visit Rome, Cairo, Jerusalem, and everywhere else
  besides, see all places of interest, visit all historical sites,
  be back in New York in time to attend to their winter duties, and
  all for the sum of 1250 dollars in American currency, or less
  than 200<i>l</i>. English. The celebrated Rev. Ward Beecher was
  to have formed one of the party, but did not carry out his
  intention. Mark Twain went instead. To the young humorist, fresh
  from the rough life of the Far West, the Eastern world was full
  of the most attractive charms. It would be something to see how
  far Rome was like Sacramento, and whether there was any
  resemblance between Cairo and San Francisco. Besides, any habits
  of the people at Naples and at Jerusalem were likely to be
  slightly dissimilar to those of a camp of miners among the
  mountains of Nevada.</p>

  <p>The incidents of this famous excursion, and the results
  arrived at, are detailed by Mark Twain in the two volumes now
  published. The first volume, entitled "The Innocents Abroad,"
  gives the details of the trip from New York as far as Naples;
  while the second volume, under the title of the "New Pilgrim's
  Progress," furnishes an account of all that the excursionists
  experienced in the Holy Land, and among the classic localities of
  the Grecian and Syrian shores.</p>

  <p>A most aptly chosen title is that of "The Innocents Abroad,"
  so far as Mark Twain is concerned. He visited Europe and Asia
  without any of the preparations for travel which most travellers
  undertake. His object was to see things as they are, and record
  the impressions they produced on a man of hjmourous perception,
  who paid his first visit to Europe without a travelling-tutor, a
  university education, or a stock of conventional sentimentality
  packed in his carpet-bag. Throughout the trip he looked at all
  objects as an untravelled American might be expected to look, and
  measured men and manners by the gauge he had set up for himself
  among the gold-hills of California and the silver-mines of
  half-civilized Nevada.</p>

  <p>I believe that Mark Twain has never visited England. Some time
  since he wrote to me asking my opinion relative to his giving an
  entertainment in London. He has appeared in New York, and
  elsewhere as a lecturer, and from his originality would, I have
  no doubt, be able to repeat his lectures with success were he to
  visit this country. But I never met him in the character of a
  public entertainer, and can only speak from experience of his
  remarkable talent as a humorous writer, and of his cordial
  frankness and jovial good-fellowship as a friend and
  companion.</p>
