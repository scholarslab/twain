          <p>The character of American humor, and its want of
          resemblance to the humor of Kamtschatka and Patagonia, --
          will the reader forgive us if we fail to set down here
          the thoughts suggested by these fresh and apposite
          topics? Will he credit us with a self-denial proportioned
          to the vastness of Mr. Clements's very amusing book, if
          we spare to state why he is so droll, or -- which is as
          much to the purpose -- why we do not know? This reticence
          will leave us very little to say by way of analysis; and,
          indeed, there is very little to say of <i>The Innocents
          Abroad</i> which is not of the most obvious and easy
          description. The idea of a steamer-load of Americans
          going on a prolonged picnic to Europe and the Holy Land
          is itself almost sufficiently delightful, and it is
          perhaps praise enough for the author to add that it
          suffers nothing from his handling. If one considers the
          fun of making a volume of six hundred octavo pages upon
          this subject, in compliance with one of the main
          conditions of a subscription book's success, bigness
          namely, one has a tolerably fair piece of humor, without
          troubling Mr. Clements further. It is out of the bounty
          and abundance of his own nature that he is as amusing in
          the execution as in the conception of his work. And it is
          always good-humored humor, too, that he lavishes on his
          reader, and even in its impudence it is charming; we do
          not remember where it is indulged at the cost of the weak
          or helpless side, or where it is insolent, with all its
          sauciness and irreverence. The standard shams of travel
          which everybody sees through suffer possibly more than
          they ought, but not so much as they might; and one
          readily forgives the harsh treatment of them in
          consideration of the novel piece of justice done on such
          a traveller as suffers under the pseudonyme of Grimes. It
          is impossible also that the quality of humor should not
          sometimes be strained in the course of so long a
          narrative; but the wonder is rather in the fact that it
          is strained so seldom.</p>

          <p>Mr. Clements gets a good deal of his fun out of his
          fellow-passengers, whom he makes us know pretty well,
          whether he presents them somewhat caricatured, as in the
          case of the "Oracle" of the ship, or carefully and
          exactly done, as in the case of such a shrewd, droll,
          business-like, sensible, kindly type of the American
          young man as "Dan." We must say also that the artist who
          has so copiously illustrated the volume has nearly always
          helped the author in the portraiture of his
          fellow-passengers, instead of hurting him, which is
          saying a good deal for an artist; in fact, we may go
          further and apply the commendation to all the
          illustrations; and this in spite of the variety of
          figures in which the same persons are represented, and
          the artist's tendency to show the characters on mules
          where the author says they rode horseback.</p>

          <p>Of course the instructive portions of Mr. Clements's
          book are of a general rather than particular character,
          and the reader gets as travel very little besides series
          of personal adventures and impressions; he is taught next
          to nothing about the population of the cities and the
          character of the rocks in the different localities. Yet
          the man who can be honest enough to let himself see the
          realities of human life everywhere, or who has only seen
          Americans as they are abroad, has not travelled in vain
          and is far from a useless guide. The very young American
          who told the English officers that a couple of our
          gunboats could come and knock Gibraltar into the
          Mediterranean Sea; the American who at a French
          restaurant "talked very loudly and coarsely, and laughed
          boisterously, where all others were so quiet and well
          behaved," and who ordered "wine, sir!" adding, to raise
          admiration in a country where wine is as much a matter of
          course as soup, "I never dine without wine, sir"; the
          American who had to be addressed several times as Gordon,
          being so accustomed to hear the name pronounced Gorrdong,
          and who had forgotten most English words during a three
          months' sojourn in Paris; the Americans who pitilessly
          made a three days' journey in Palestine within two days,
          cruelly overworking the poor beasts they rode, and
          overtaxing the strength of their comrades, in order not
          to break the Sabbath; the American Pilgrims who travelled
          half round the world to be able to take a sail on the Sea
          of Galilee, and then missed their sole opportunity
          because they required the boatman to take them for one
          napoleon when he wanted two; -- these are all Americans
          who are painted to peculiar advantage by Mr. Clements,
          and who will be easily recognized by such as have had the
          good fortune to meet them abroad.</p>

          <p>The didactic, however, is not Mr. Clements's
          prevailing mood, nor his best, by any means. The greater
          part of his book is in the vein of irony, which, with a
          delicious impudence, he attributes to Saint Luke,
          declaring that Luke, in speaking of the winding "street,
          called Straight" in Damascus, "is careful not to commit
          himself; he does not say it is the street which <i>is</i>
          straight, but the street which is <i>called</i>
          Straight.' It is a fine piece of irony; it is the only
          facetious remark in the Bible, I believe." At Tiberias
          our author saw the women who wear their dowry in their
          head-dresses of coins. "Most of these maidens were not
          wealthy, but some few have been kindly dealt with by
          fortune. I saw heiresses there, worth, in their own
          right, -- worth, well, I suppose I might venture to say
          as much as nine dollars and a half. But such cases are
          rare. When you come across one of these, she naturally
          puts on airs." He thinks the owner of the horse
          "Jericho," on which he travelled towards Jerusalem, "had
          a wrong opinion about him. He had an idea that he was one
          of those fiery, untamed, steeds, but he is not of that
          character. I know the Arab had this idea, because when he
          brought the horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept
          jerking at the bridle and shouting in Arabic, Ho! will
          you? Do you want to run away, you ferocious beast, and
          break your neck?' when all the time the horse was not
          doing anything in the world, and only looked like he
          wanted to lean up against something and think. Whenever
          he is not shying at things or reaching after a fly, he
          wants to do that yet. How it would surprise his owner to
          know this!" In this vein of ironical drollery is that now
          celebrated passage in which Mr. Clements states that he
          was affected to tears on coming, a stranger in a strange
          land, upon the grave of a blood-relation, -- the tomb of
          Adam; but that passage is somewhat more studied in tone
          than most parts of the book, which are written with a
          very successful approach in style to colloquial drolling.
          As Mr. Clements writes of his experiences, we imagine he
          would talk of them; and very amusing talk it would be:
          often not at all fine in matter or manner, but full of
          touches of humor, -- which if not delicate are nearly
          always easy, -- and having a base of excellent sense and
          good feeling. There is an amount of pure human nature in
          the book, that rarely gets into literature; the depths of
          our poor unregeneracy -- dubious even of the blissfulness
          of bliss -- are sounded by such a simple confession as
          Mr. Clements makes in telling of his visit to the Emperor
          of Russia: "I would as soon have thought of being
          cheerful in Abraham's bosom as in the palace of an
          Emperor." Almost any topic, and any event of the author's
          past life, he finds pertinent to the story of European
          and Oriental travel, and if the reader finds it
          impertinent, he does not find it the less amusing. The
          effect is dependent in so great degree upon this
          continuous incoherence, that no chosen passage can
          illustrate the spirit of the whole, while the passage
          itself loses half in separation from the context.
          Nevertheless, here is part of the account given by Mr.
          Clements of the Pilgrims' excursion to the river Jordan,
          over roads supposed to be infested by Bedouins; and the
          reader who does not think it droll as it stands can go to
          our author for the <a name="3">rest</a>.</p>

            I think we must all have determined upon the same line
            of tactics, for it did seem as if we never would get to
            Jericho. I had a notoriously slow horse, but somehow I
            could not keep him in the rear, to save my neck. He was
            forever turning up in the lead. In such cases I
            trembled a little, and got down to fix my saddle. But
            it was not of any use. The others all got down to fix
            their saddles, too. I never saw such a time with
            saddles. It was the first time any of them had got out
            of order in three weeks, and now they had all broken
            down at once. I tried walking, for exercise--I had not
            had enough in Jerusalem searching for holy places. But
            it was a failure. The whole mob were suffering for
            exercise, and it was not fifteen minutes till they were
            all on foot and I had the lead again. . . .<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; . . . We were moping along down through
            this dreadful place, every man in the rear. Our
            guards--two gorgeous young Arab sheiks, with cargoes of
            swords, guns, pistols, and daggers on board--were
            loafing ahead.<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; "Bedouins!"<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; Every man shrunk up and disappeared in
            his clothes like a mud-turtle. My first impulse was to
            dash forward and destroy the Bedouins. My second was to
            dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in
            that direction. I acted on the latter impulse. So did
            all the others. If any Bedouins had approached us,
            then, from that point of the compass, they would have
            paid dearly for their rashness.

          <p>Under his <i>nom de plume</i> of Mark Twain, Mr.
          Clements is well known to the very large world of
          newspaper-readers; and this book ought to secure him
          something better than the uncertain standing of a popular
          favorite. It is no business of ours to fix his rank among
          the humorists California has given us, but we think he
          is, in an entirely different way from all the others,
          quite worthy of the company of the best.</p>
