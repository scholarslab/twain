        <p>I understand it, I think. The people who go into
        ecstacies over St. Sophia get them out of the guide book
        (where every church is spoken of as being "considered by
        good judges to be the most marvelous structure, in many
        respects, that the world has ever seen.") Or else they are
        these old-master worshippers from the wilds of New Jersey,
        who can't tell a fresco from lath-and-plaster, and don't
        know any more about pictures than a kangaroo does about
        astronomy. And so you always hear them carrying on about
        wonderful pictures, wonderful statuary and wonderful
        architecture, the shameless lunatics! as if they had always
        been used to palaces and studios, extensive travel and the
        company of the elegant and accomplished, instead of being
        raised in a cow-lot, educated in a saw-mill, and their
        minds enlarged and stored with precious knowledge by travel
        down a creek on a shingle raft.</p>

        <p>Now there was that wretched woman in the Vatican in
        Rome. She overheard Brown say something outrageous about
        the old masters, and she permitted him to overhear her say
        something rather savage about "people who had no
        appreciation of the divine works of the great masters." It
        was not a gentlemanly thing for a lady to do, but she did
        not know that, perhaps. However, she went into hysterics,
        pretty soon, over a picture marked "Angelo," and called it
        a miracle of art, and a heavenly conception and a work such
        as none but inspired hands could have wrought, and a lot
        more of sickening nonsense like that, but finally an
        officer of the institution came along and set her back. He
        said that that particular "Angelo" was <i>not</i> Mike, but
        a certain other Angelo who used to be a butcher in
        Pisa--and that after painting until he found out it was not
        his best hold, he went back into the butchering business
        again. I just had an idea that may be that woman had had
        more experience in tending babies on a salary than in
        setting in judgment on the inspired fire-screens of the old
        masters.</p>
