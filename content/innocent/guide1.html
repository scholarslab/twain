        <center><font size="+1"><b>Harper's Hand-book for Travelers<br /> in
        Europe and The East</b></font> (Ninth Year)<br />
        By W. Pembroke Fetridge<br /> (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers,
        1870)</center>



        <p>[<i>The section on Paris, the longest in the book,
        covers 74 pages. It begins with a discussion of hotels,
        then backs up to consider the history of the city and its
        contemporary political situation, before getting to the
        attractions. Starting with museums, Fetridge concludes by
        talking about how to get oneself presented to the Emperor,
        and where to buy the new clothes one would want to wear on
        such an occasion. The following two passages are from the
        middle of this lengthy account.</i>]</p>

        <p><i>The Mabille</i>, or <i>Jardin des Fleurs</i>, should
        be visited in the evening. Every thing that taste and skill
        could do has been done to make it a fairy scene of
        enchantment. In a beautiful semicircular building is seated
        a well-conducted orchestra, around which the "gayest of the
        gay" whirl themselves through the mazes of the waltz,
        polka, and mazourka. As the dances are, as a general thing,
        considered a little loose, it is unnecessary to say the
        gentleman traveler is not expected, in company with his
        wife or daughter, to join in the amusement of the dancers,
        although we see no harm in looking on. It may be that
        "chilling reserve" is not a characteristic of the ladies
        who frequent these gardens; still, every thing is conducted
        with a proper regard for public decency. Recesses, bowers,
        and groves every where meet the eye, while multitudes of
        gas-lights twinkle through the grass, or illuminate the
        Chinese lanterns festooned from the trees. You have also a
        shooting-gallery, Chinese billard-tables, a cafe and
        restaurant, where you may enjoy your coffee, beer, wine, or
        cigars; admission, 2 francs.</p>

        <p><i>Musee du Louvre</i>. -- . . . Next to this is the
        <i>Salle Ronde</i>: the ceiling is beautifully frescoed,
        and the pavement a fine mosaic; it opens into the
        <i>Galerie d'Apollon</i>. This splendid gallery is one of
        the finest in the Louvre. For over one hundred years it has
        been occupied as a picture-gallery; was rejuvenated by the
        present emperor in 1851. It commands a fine view of the
        Seine and the garden. Portraits of many of the leading
        artists are finely executed in Gobelins tapestry, and adorn
        the walls. Next to this gallery we pass into the <i>Salon
        Carre</i>. This room contains the choicest gem of the
        Louvre, Murillo's <i>Conception</i>, purchased at Marshal
        Soult's sale for $123,060. There are many other valuable
        paintings in this room. Next comes the <i>Long Gallery</i>,
        divided into five compartments. One of these is devoted to
        Rubens's pictures exclusively. The whole gallery contains
        some eighteen hundred paintings, and is about equally
        divided between Italian, Spanish, German, Flemish, and
        French schools. No pictures are here admitted except those
        of deceased masters. This gallery is considered the finest
        in the world; there may be pictures of more value in the
        two galleries at Florence or the gallery at Dresden, but,
        taking quantity and quality together, it richly deserves
        the title.</p>
