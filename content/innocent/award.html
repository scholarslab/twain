        <p>M<font size="-1">R. PUNCH</font>, M<font size="-1">Y
        DEAR</font> S<font size="-1">IR</font>, -- I skurcely need
        inform you that your excellent Tower is very pop'lar with
        peple from the agricultooral districks, and it was chiefly
        them class which I found waitin at the gates the other
        mornin.</p>

        <p>I saw at once that the Tower was established on a firm
        basis. In the entire history of firm basisis I don't find a
        basis more firmer than this one.</p>

        <p>"You have no Tower in America?" said a man in the crowd,
        who had somehow detected my denomination.</p>

        <p>"Alars! no," I ansered; "we boste of our enterprise and
        improovements, and yit we are devoid of a Tower. America,
        oh my onhappy country! thou hast not got no Tower! It's a
        sweet Boon."</p>

        <p>The gates opened after awhile, and we all purchist
        tickets and went into a waitin-room.</p>

        <p>"My frens," said a pale-faced little man, in black
        close, "this is a sad day."</p>

        <p>"Inasmuch as to how?" I said.</p>

        <p>"I mean it is sad to think that so many people hve been
        killed within these gloomy walls. My frens, let us drop a
        tear!"</p>

        <p>"No," I said, "you must excuse me. Others may drop one
        if they feel like it; but as for me, I decline. The early
        managers of this institootion were a bad lot, and their
        crimes were trooly orful; but I can't sob for those who
        died four or five hundred years ago. If they was my own
        relations I couldn't. It's absurd to shed sobs over things
        which occurd durin the rain of Henry the Three. Let us be
        cheerful," I continued. "Look at the festiv Warders, in
        their red flannil jackets. They are cheerful, and why
        should it not be thusly with us?"</p>
        <hr width="60%" />

        <p>The room where the daggers and pistils and other weppins
        is kept is interestin. Among this collection of choice
        cutlery I notist the bow and arrer which those hot-heded
        old chaps used to conduct battles with. It is quite like
        the bow and arrer used at this day by certin tribes of
        American Injuns, and they shoot 'em off with such a
        excellent precision that I almost sigh'd to be a Injun,
        when I was in the Rocky Mountain regin. They are a pleasant
        lot them Injuns. Mr. Cooper and Dr. Catlin have told us of
        the red man's wonerful eloquence, and I found it so. Our
        party was stopt on the plains of Utah by a band a
        Shoshones, whose chief said, "Brothers! the pale-face is
        welcome. Brothers! the sun is sinkin in the West, and
        Warra-bucky-she will soon cease speakin. Brothers! the poor
        red man belongs to a race which is fast becomin extink." He
        then whooped in a shrill manner, stole all our blankets and
        whisky, and fled to the primeval forest to conceal his
        emotions.</p>

        <p>I will remark here, while on the subjeck of Injuns, that
        they are in the main a very shaky set, with even less sense
        than the Fenians, and when I hear philanthropists bewailin
        the fack that every year "carries the noble red man nearer
        the settin sun," I simply have to say I'm glad of it, tho'
        it is rough on the settin sun. They call you by the sweet
        name of Brother one minit, and the next the scalp you with
        their Thomashawks. But I wander. Let us return to the
        Tower.</p>
        <hr width="60%" />

        <p>The Warder showd us some instrooments of tortur, such as
        thumbscrews, throat-collars, etc., statin that these was
        conkerd from the Spanish Armady, and addin what a crooil
        peple the Spaniards was in them days -- which elissited
        from a bright eyed little girl of about twelve summers the
        remark that she tho't it <i>was</i> rich to talk about the
        crooilty of the Spaniards usin thumbscrews, when we was in
        a Tower where so many poor peple's heads had been cut off.
        This made the Warder stammer and turn red.</p>

        <p>I was so blessed with the little girl's brightness that
        I could have kissed the dear child, and I would if she'd
        been six years older.</p>
