        With the help of computer technology <a href=
        "webmap.html">this map</a> attempts to display two different
        things. The black line tracks the route MT took on the <i>Quaker City</i>
        excursion. At the same time, the 13 places named <font color="#0033FF">in
        blue</font> are active links. Clicking on any of them will
        take you to a passage in <i>Innocents Abroad</i> about that
        place. And when MT's book is reconceived this way --
        geographically, or geo-culturally -- what begins to appear
        is a map of the racial and ethnic prejudices shared by the
        book and its American audience.<br /><br />

        <p>The lines on this ideological map aren't always clearly
        drawn. <i>Innocents Abroad</i> is rhetorically
        opportunistic rather than thematically coherent. MT's
        perspective often switches around, and whenever his
        point-of-view changes so does the site he's looking at. He
        offers a graphic description, for example, of <a href=
        "venxday.html">Venice by day</a>; a few minutes and
        paragraphs later, however, and <a href=
        "venxnite.html">Venice by night</a> is a different place
        altogether. He finds things to mock and to admire almost
        everywhere he goes.</p>

        <p>But as you'll see by comparing what he writes about
        northern locales like Paris and Odessa with what he writes
        about Mediterranean Europe, or comparing any of these
        passages with the way he describes non-white and
        non-Christian peoples in Africa and Asia, many of the
        variations in the narrative's tone can be linked directly
        to racial preconceptions. (A good instance of this is the
        way his nose comes increasingly into play as people's skins
        get darker; after only a brief time in Constantinople, for
        example, he can talk without irony about what Turks "smell
        like.")</p>

        <p>The links to Jerusalem and the Sphinx will bring up the passages that MT's contemporary
        readers seem to have enjoyed the most. But the
        other passages were picked to display the pattern of the book's
        preconceptions. Some fans of MT may decide that what this
        map chiefly exposes is my own biased reading of the text,
        but I've tried to be fair. You can check to see how fairly
        I've chosen by clicking on the graphic of the "Siamese
        twins" at the bottom right of each "page"; that will take
        you to the whole chapter from which the passage comes.
        (Clicking on the icon of the map at the bottom left will
        bring you back to the map.)</p>

        <p><i>Innocents Abroad</i> was the most popular travel book
        of MT's times. Its irreverent humor, its blithe assertion
        of America's readiness to take on the world, even (as the
        advertising would put it) its length and its lavish
        illustrations -- all these were major reasons for its
        extraordinary appeal to American readers. At the same time,
        the book's way of looking at Europe, Africa and Asia add up
        to a tour of the ideological world inside many of MT's
        contemporaries' heads.</p>
