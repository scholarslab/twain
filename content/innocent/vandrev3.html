    <b>Mark Twain.</b>
  </center>

  <p>Last evening Young Men's Hall was densely crowded with one of
  the largest audiences of the season, to listen to Mark Twain in
  his new <i>role</i> of comic lecturer. Of course all were
  intensely amused at his droll sayings, but it is perhaps safe to
  say that his capabilities as a writer are far in advance of his
  powers as a lecturer. The lecture itself was decidedly good, but
  its delivery was not what might have been expected, an assumed
  drawl, though very taking and appropriate at times, spoiling the
  effect of many of the finest sentences. Some of the more serious
  passages were of the most brilliant order, but their effect was
  sadly marred by the failing already alluded to. The allusion to
  the Sphynx is a striking illustration of this:</p>

  <p>"The great face was so sad, so earnest, so longing, so
  patient. There was a dignity not of earth in its mien, and in its
  countenance a benignity such as never any thing human wore. It
  was stone, but it seemed sentient! If ever image of stone
  thought, it was thinking. It was looking toward the verge of the
  landscape, but looking at nothing--nothing but distance and
  vacancy. It was looking over and beyond every thing of the
  present, and far into the past. It was gazing out over the ocean
  of time--over lines of century-waves which, further and further
  receding, closed nearer and nearer together, and blended at last
  into one unbroken tide, away toward the horizon of a remote
  antiquity.</p>

  <p>"It was thinking of the wars of departed ages--of the empires
  it had seen created and destroyed--of the nations whose birth it
  had witnessed, whose progress it had watched, whose annihilation
  it had noted--of the joy and sorrow, the life and death, the
  grandeur and decay, of five thousand slow revolving years.</p>

  <p>"It was the type of an attribute of man--of a faculty of his
  heart and brain. It was M<font size=
  "- 1">EMORY</font>--R<font size="-1">ETROSPECTIVE</font>--wrought
  into visible, tangible form. All who know what pathos there is in
  memories of days that are accomplished and faces that have
  vanished--albeit only a trifling score of years gone by--will
  have some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave
  eyes that look so steadfastly back upon the things they knew
  before history was born--before tradition had being--things that
  were, and forms that moved, in a vague era which even poetry and
  romance scarce know of--and passed one by one away and left the
  stony dreamer solitary in the midst of a strange new age, and
  uncomprehended scenes!</p>

  <p>"The Sphynx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in its
  magnitude; it is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its
  story. And there is that in the overshadowing majesty of this
  eternal figure of stone, with its accusing memory of the deeds of
  all ages, which reveals to one something of what he shall feel
  when he stands at last in the awful presence of God!"</p><br />
