  <blockquote>
    <a name="a" id="a">The tomb</a> of Adam! How touching it was,
    here in a land of strangers, far away from home, and friends,
    and all who cared for me, thus to discover the grave of a blood
    relation. True, a distant one, but still a relation. The
    unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition. The
    fountain of my filial affection was stirred to its profoundest
    depths, and I gave way to tumultuous emotion. I leaned upon a
    pillar and burst into tears. I deem it no shame to have wept
    over the grave of my poor dead relative. Let him who would
    sneer at my emotion close this volume here, for he will find
    little to his taste in my journeyings through Holy Land. Noble
    old man--he did not live to see me--he did not live to see his
    child. And I--I--alas, I did not live to see <i>him</i>.
    Weighed down by sorrow and disappointment, he died before I was
    born--six thousand brief summers before I was born. But let us
    try to bear it with fortitude. Let us trust that he is better
    off where he is. Let us take comfort in the thought that his
    loss is our eternal gain.

  <blockquote>
    <a name="b" id="b">At noon</a> we took a swim in the Sea of
    Galilee--a blessed privilege in this roasting climate--and then
    lunched under a neglected old fig tree at the fountain they
    call Ain-et-Tin, a hundred yards from ruined Capernaum. Every
    rivulet that gurgles out of the rocks and sands of this part of
    the world is dubbed with the title of "fountain," and people
    familiar with the Hudson, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi
    fall into transports of admiration over them, and exhaust their
    powers of composition in writing their praises. If all the
    poetry and nonsense that have been discharged upon the
    fountains and the bland scenery of this region were collected
    in a book, in would make a most valuable volume to burn.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; During luncheon, the pilgrim enthusiasts of our
    party, who had been so light-headed and happy ever since they
    touched holy ground that they did little but mutter incoherent
    rhapsodies, could scarcely eat, so anxious were they to "take
    shipping" and sail in very person upon the waters that had
    borne the vessels of the Apostles. Their anxiety grew and their
    excitement augmented with every fleeting moment, until my fears
    were aroused and I began to have misgivings that in their
    present condition they might break recklessly loose from all
    considerations of prudence and buy a whole fleet of ships to
    sail in instead of hiring a single one for an hour, as quiet
    folk are wont to do. I trembled to think of the ruined purses
    this day's performances might result in. I could not help
    reflecting bodingly upon the intemperate zeal with which
    middle-aged men are apt to surfeit themselves upon a seductive
    folly which they have tasted for the first time. And yet I did
    not feel that I had a right to be surprised at the state of
    things which was giving me so much concern. These men had been
    taught from infancy to revere, almost to worship, the holy
    places whereon their happy eyes were resting now. For many and
    many a year this very picture had visited their thoughts by day
    and floated through their dreams by night. To stand before it
    in the flesh--to see it as they saw it now--to sail upon the
    hallowed sea, and kiss the holy soil that compassed it about;
    these were aspirations they had cherished while a generation
    dragged its lagging seasons by and left its furrows in their
    faces and its frosts upon their hair. To look upon this
    picture, and sail upon this sea, they had forsaken home and its
    idols and journeyed thousands and thousands of miles, in
    weariness and tribulation. What wonder that the sordid lights
    of work-day prudence should pale before the glory of a hope
    like theirs in the full splendor of its fruition? Let them
    squander millions! I said--who speaks of money at a time like
    this?<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In this frame of mind I followed, as fast as I
    could, the eager footsteps of the pilgrims, and stood upon the
    shore of the lake, and swelled, with hat and voice, the frantic
    hail they sent after the "ship" that was speeding by. It was a
    success. The toilers of the sea ran in and beached their bark.
    Joy sat upon every countenance.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; "How much?--ask him how much, Ferguson!--how much
    to take us all--eight of us and you--to Bethsaida, yonder, and
    to the mouth of Jordan, and to the place where the swine ran
    down into the sea--quick!--and we want to coast around
    everywhere--everywhere!--all day long! --<i>I</i> could sail a
    year in these waters!--and tell him we'll stop at Magdala and
    finish at Tiberias!--ask him how much!--anything--anything
    whatever!--tell him we don't care what the expense is!" (I said
    to myself, I knew how it would be.)<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Ferguson</i>--(interpreting)--"He says two
    napoleons--eight dollars."<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; One or two countenances fell. Then a pause.<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; "Too much!--we'll give him one!"<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall never know how it was--I shudder yet when
    I think how the place is given to miracles--but in a single
    instant of time, as it seemed to me, that ship was twenty paces
    from the shore, and speeding away like a frightened thing!
    Eight crest-fallen creatures stood upon the shore, and oh, to
    think of it! this--this--after all that overmastering ecstasy!
    Oh, shameful, shameful ending, after such unseemly boasting! It
    was too much like "Ho! let me at him!" followed by a prudent,
    "Two of you hold him--one can hold me!"

  <blockquote>
    <a name="c" id="c">I think</a> we must all have determined upon
    the same line of tactics, for it did seem as if we never would
    get to Jericho. I had a notoriously slow horse, but somehow I
    could not keep him in the rear, to save my neck. He was forever
    turning up in the lead. In such cases I trembled a little, and
    got down to fix my saddle. But it was not of any use. The
    others all got down to fix their saddles, too. I never saw such
    a time with saddles. It was the first time any of them had got
    out of order in three weeks, and now they had all broken down
    at once. I tried walking, for exercise--I had not had enough in
    Jerusalem searching for holy places. But it was a failure. The
    whole mob were suffering for exercise, and it was not fifteen
    minutes till they were all on foot and I had the lead again. .
    . .

    <p>. . . We were moping along down through this dreadful place,
    every man in the rear. Our guards--two gorgeous young Arab
    sheiks, with cargoes of swords, guns, pistols, and daggers on
    board--were loafing ahead.</p>

    <p>"Bedouins!"</p>

    <p>Every man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a
    mud-turtle. My first impulse was to dash forward and destroy
    the Bedouins. My second was to dash to the rear to see if there
    were any coming in that direction. I acted on the latter
    impulse. So did all the others. If any Bedouins had approached
    us, then, from that point of the compass, they would have paid
    dearly for their rashness.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <a name="d" id="d">In this connection I wish to say one word
    about Michael Angelo Buonarotti. I used to worship the mighty
    genius of Michael Angelo--that man who was great in poetry,
    painting, sculpture, architecture--great in everything he
    undertook. But I do not want Michael Angelo for breakfast--for
    luncheon--for dinner--for tea--for supper--for between meals. I
    like a change, occasionally. In Genoa, he designed everything;
    in Milan he or his pupils designed everything; he designed the
    Lake of Como; in Padua, Verona, Venice, Bologna, who did we
    ever hear of, from guides, but Michael Angelo? In Florence, he
    painted everything, designed everything, nearly, and what he
    did not design he used to sit on a favorite stone and look at,
    and they showed us the stone. In Pisa he designed everything
    but the old shot-tower, and they would have attributed that to
    him if it had not been so awfully out of the perpendicular. He
    designed the piers of Leghorn and the custom-house regulations
    of Civita Vecchia. But, here--here it is frightful. He designed
    St. Peter's; he designed the Pope; he designed the Pantheon,
    the uniform of the Pope's soldiers, the Tiber, the Vatican, the
    Coliseum, the Capitol, the Tarpeian Rock, the Barberini Palace,
    St. John Lateran, the Campagna, the Appian Way, the Seven
    Hills, the Baths of Caracalla, the Claudian Aqueduct, the
    Cloaca Maxima--the eternal bore designed the Eternal City, and
    unless all men and books do lie, he painted everything in it!
    Dan said the other day to the guide, "Enough, enough, enough!
    Say no more! Lump the whole thing! say that the Creator made
    Italy from designs by Michael Angelo!"<br />
    <br /></a>

    <p>I never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil,
    so filled with a blessed peace, as I did yesterday, when I
    learned that Michael Angelo was dead.</p>
