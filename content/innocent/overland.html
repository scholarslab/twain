          <p>Six hundred and fifty pages of open and declared fun
          -- very strongly accented with wood-cuts at that -- might
          go far toward frightening the fastidious reader. But the
          Hartford publishers, we imagine, do not print for the
          fastidious reader, nor do traveling book agents sell much
          to that rarely occurring man, who prefers to find books
          rather than let them find <i>him</i>. So that, unless he
          has already made "Mark Twain's" acquaintance through the
          press, he will not probably meet him until, belated in
          the rural districts, he takes from the parlor table of a
          country farm-house an illustrated Bible, Greeley's
          <i>American Conflict,</i> Mr. Parton's apocryphal
          <i>Biographies,</i> successively and listlessly, and so
          comes at last upon "Mark Twain's" <i>Innocents</i> like a
          joyous revelation -- an Indian spring in an alkaline
          literary desert. For the book has that intrinsic worth of
          bigness and durability which commends itself to the rural
          economist, who likes to get a material return for his
          money. It is about the size of <i>The Family
          Physician,</i> for which it will doubtless be often
          mistaken -- with great advantage to the patient. The
          entire six hundred and fifty pages are devoted to an
          account of the "steamship <i>Quaker City's</i> excursion
          to Europe and the Holy Land," with a description of
          certain famous localities of which a great many six
          hundred and fifty pages have been, at various times,
          written by various tourists. Yet there is hardly a line
          of Mr. Clemens' account that is not readable; and none
          the less, certainly, from the fact that he pokes fun at
          other tourists, and that the reader becomes dimly
          conscious that Mr. Clemens' fellow-passengers would have
          probably estopped this gentle satirist from going with
          them could they have forecast his book. The very title
          <i>-- The Innocents Abroad</i> -- is a suggestive hint of
          the lawlessness and audacity in which the trip is
          treated. We shall not stop to question the propriety of
          this feature: it is only just to Mr. Clemens to say, that
          the best satirists have generally found their quarry in
          the circle in which they moved, and among their best
          friends; but we contend that if he has, by this act,
          choked off and prevented the enthusiastic chronicling of
          the voyage by any of his fellow-passengers, who may have
          been sentimentally inclined, he is entitled to the
          consideration of a suffering world; and it shall stand in
          extenuation of some mannerism that is only slang, some
          skepticism that lacks the cultivation which only makes
          skepticism tolerable, and some sentiment that is only
          rhetoric. And so, with an irreverence for his
          fellow-pilgrims which was equaled only by his scorn for
          what they admired, this hilarious image-breaker started
          upon his mission. The situation was felicitous, the
          conditions perfect for the indulgence of an humor that
          seems to have had very little moral or esthetic
          limitation. The whole affair was a huge practical joke,
          of which not the least amusing feature was the fact that
          "Mark Twain" had embarked in it. Before the <i>Quaker</i>
          <i>City</i> reached Fayal, the first stopping-place, he
          had worked himself into a grotesque rage at every thing
          and every body. In this mock assumption of a righteous
          indignation, lies, we think, the real power of the book,
          and the decided originality of Mr. Clemens' humor. It
          enables him to say his most deliberately funny things
          with all the haste and exaggeration of rage; it gives him
          an opportunity to invent such epithets as "animated
          outrage," and "spider-legged gorilla," and apply them,
          with no sense of personal responsibility on the part of
          reader or writer. And the rage is always ludicrously
          disproportionate to the cause. It is "Mr. Boythorn,"
          without his politeness, or his cheerful intervals. For,
          when "Mark Twain" is not simulating indignation, he is
          <i>really</i> sentimental. He shows it in fine writing --
          in really admirable rhetoric, vigorous and picturesque --
          but too apt, at times, to suggest the lecturing attitude,
          or the reporter's flourish. Yet it is so much better than
          what one had any right to expect, and is such an
          agreeable relief to long passages of extravagant humor,
          that the reader is very apt to overlook the real fact,
          that it is often quite as extravagant. Yet, with all his
          independence, "Mark Twain" seems to have followed his
          guide and guidebooks with a simple, unconscious fidelity.
          He was quite content to see only that which every body
          else sees, even if he was not content to see it with the
          same eyes. His record contains no new facts or features
          of the countries visited. He has always his own
          criticism, his own comments, his own protests, but always
          concerning the same old facts. Either from lack of time
          or desire, he never stepped out of the tread-mill round
          of "sights." His remarks might have been penciled on the
          margins of Murray. This is undoubtedly a good way to
          correct the enthusiasm or misstatements of other
          tourists; but is, perhaps, hardly the best method of
          getting at the truth for one's self. As a conscientious,
          painstaking traveler, "Mark Twain," we fear, is not to be
          commended. But that his book would have been as amusing,
          if he had been, is a matter of doubt. Most of the
          criticism is just in spirit, although extravagant, and
          often too positive in style. But it should be remembered
          that the style itself is a professional exaggeration, and
          that the irascible pilgrim, "Mark Twain," is a very
          eccentric creation of Mr. Clemens'. We can, perhaps, no
          more fairly hold Mr. Clemens responsible for "Mark
          Twain's" irreverence than we could have held the late Mr.
          Charles F. Browne to account for "Artemus Ward's"
          meanness and humbuggery. There may be a question of taste
          in Mr. Clemens permitting such a man as "Mark Twain" to
          go to the Holy Land at all; but we contend that such a
          traveler would be more likely to report its external
          aspect truthfully than a man of larger reverence. And are
          there not Lamartines, Primes, and unnumbered sentimental
          and pious pilgrims to offset these losel skeptics -- or,
          as our author would say, such "animated outrages" -- as
          Ross Browne, Swift, "Mark Twain," <i>et al</i>.</p>

          <p>To subject Mr. Clemens to any of those delicate tests
          by which we are supposed to detect the true humorist,
          might not be either fair or convincing. He has caught,
          with great appreciation and skill, that ungathered humor
          and extravagance which belong to pioneer communities --
          which have been current in bar-rooms, on railways, and in
          stages -- and which sometimes get crudely into
          literature, as "a fellow out West says." A good deal of
          this is that picturesque Western talk which we call
          "slang," in default of a better term for inchoate
          epigram. His characters speak naturally, and in their own
          tongue. If he has not it that balance of pathos which we
          deem essential to complete humor, he has something very
          like it in that serious eloquence to which we have before
          alluded. Like all materialists, he is an honest hater of
          all cant -- except, of course, the cant of materialism --
          which, it is presumed, is perfectly right and proper. To
          conclude: after a perusal of this volume, we see no
          reason for withholding the opinion we entertained before
          taking it up, that Mr. Clemens deserves to rank foremost
          among Western humorists; and, in California, above his
          only rival, "John Phoenix," whose fun, though more
          cultivated and spontaneous, lacked the sincere purpose
          and larger intent of "Mark Twain's."</p>
