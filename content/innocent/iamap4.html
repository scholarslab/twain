        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Paris Nightlife</h2><br />

        <p>The dance had begun, and we adjourned to the temple.
        Within it was a drinking saloon, and all around it was a
        broad circular platform for the dancers. I backed up
        against the wall of the temple and waited. Twenty sets
        formed, the music struck up, and then--I placed my hands
        before my face for very shame. But I looked through my
        fingers. They were dancing the renowned "Cancan." A
        handsome girl in the set before me tripped forward lightly
        to meet the opposite gentleman, tripped back again, grasped
        her dresses vigorously on both sides with her hands, raised
        them pretty high, danced an extraordinary jig that had more
        activity and exposure about it than any jig I ever saw
        before, and then, drawing her clothes still higher, she
        advanced gaily to the center and launched a vicious kick
        full at her <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> that must infallibly
        have removed his nose if he had been seven feet high. It
        was a mercy he was only six.</p>

        <p>That is the cancan. The idea of it is to dance as
        wildly, as noisily, as furiously as you can; expose
        yourself as much as possible if you are a woman; and kick
        as high as you can, no matter which sex you belong to.
        There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid,
        respectable, aged people who were there that night can
        testify to the truth of that statement. There were a good
        many such people present. I suppose French morality is not
        of that straight-laced description which is shocked at
        trifles.</p>

        <p>I moved aside and took a general view of the cancan.
        Shouts, laughter, furious music, a bewildering chaos of
        darting and intermingling forms, stormy jerking and
        snatching of gay dresses, bobbing beads, flying arms,
        lightning flashes of white-stockinged calves and dainty
        slippers in the air, and then a grand final rush, riot, a
        terrific hubbub, and a wild stampede! Heavens! Nothing like
        it has been seen on earth since trembling Tam O'Shanter saw
        the devil and the witches at their orgies that stormy night
        in "Alloway's auld haunted kirk."</p>
