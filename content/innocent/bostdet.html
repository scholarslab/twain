          <p>MARK TWAIN'S NEW BOOK. What would the great old
          romantic voyagers and travellers, the heroes of Hackluyt
          and Purchas, say of the monster Yankee picnic to Europe
          and the Holy Land? I think that if those worthies were to
          get hold of a copy of Mark Twain's account of the
          excursion, there would be laughter in Elysium. At any
          rate, I can hardly believe it possible for an earthly
          reader -- unless, indeed, like Charles Lamb's Scotchman,
          he is joke-proof -- to peruse Twain's new book, <i>The
          Innocents Abroad,</i> without "laughing consumedly." The
          work, however, though rich in joke and jest is not, like
          Gilbert a Becket's dreary comic histories, a merely funny
          book. On the contrary, it is a very full and
          matter-of-fact record of travel in Europe and the East,
          delightfully flavored with humor and plentifully spiced
          with wit. Addison's sober citizen complained that there
          were too many plums and no suet in his pudding, but no
          one can say that Twain's literary pudding is wanting in
          suet or too full of plums.</p>

          <p>Our author is not one of the "one-eyed travellers,"
          mentioned by Whateley, who see "a great deal of some
          particular class of objects, and are blind to all
          others," but a shrewd, quick-witted person, who travelled
          with his eyes very wide open, and saw things as they
          were, not as they have been described by poets and
          romancers. It is not, however, so much for its new,
          truthful and pleasant pictures of Old World places and
          people, as for the delicious wit and humor scattered so
          freely up and down the book, that one praises and prizes
          <i>The Innocents Abroad.</i> And it is such good humor,
          too, most of it, and with all its freedom and riot,
          touching gently and lovingly all serious things. I have
          been reading Fuller's <i>Pisgah Sight of Palestine,</i>
          and derived no little amusement by comparing his
          descriptions of the Holy Land with Mark Twain's. Fuller,
          though as pious and reverent as a saint, was a rare wit
          and humorist, and his book on Palestine is brimming over
          with merry quibbles and jocular humor. Although some of
          Mark Twain's levities might have displeased the witty old
          divine, I think that he would have laughed loud and long
          at the passage concerning the tomb of Adam.</p>

          <p><i>The Innocents Abroad</i> is issued by the American
          Publishing Company of Hartford, and is sold only by
          subscription. The Boston agents are George M. Smith &amp;
          Co., No. 6 Tremont Street.</p>
