  <p>9. William Ward: 'American Humorists',<br />
  Macon (Mississippi) <i>Beacon<br /></i>14 May 1870, 2</p>

  <p>Ward was editor of the <i>Beacon.</i> J[ohn] Ross Browne
  (1821-75), traveller and author, wrote <i>Yusef, or, A Journey of
  the Frangi: A Crusade in the East</i> (1853), a travel book. The
  <i>Beacon</i> article closes with praise for the poetry of John
  G. Saxe.</p>

  <p>Within the last thirty years a series of humorous writers have
  made their appearance, at intervals, each of whom seems to have
  selected some speciality as a basis upon which he might attain an
  ephemeral popularity. These specialties have been the different
  dialects, or, rather provincialisms, which are prevalent in
  different sections of our country, though a few of them have
  adopted as a basis the flexibility of our language and its
  adaptability to antithesis and exaggeration. Of all these, there
  are only two whose popularity will be permanent &ndash; one of
  the earliest and one of the latest &ndash; Washington Irving and
  'Mark Twain' &ndash; because they have none of these adventitious
  elements of humor upon which the others depend for popularity,
  but weave their subtle webs in the unadulterated English.</p>

  <p>[discusses briefly twelve American humorists.]</p>

  <p>But, since Irving, no humorist in prose has laid the
  foundation of a permanent fame, except it be Mark Twain, and
  this, as in the case of Irving, is because he is a pure writer.
  Aside from the subtle mirth that lurks through his compositions,
  the grace and finish of his more didactic and descriptive
  sentences indicate more than mediocrity, though much of his
  writing has a dash of Bulwer in it. Compare his description of
  the Sphinx in the <i>Innocents Abroad</i> with Bulwer's in the
  <i>Last Days of Pompeii,</i> and we are struck with the
  similarity of the two passages; there are the same ideas, clothed
  in the same fine rhetoric, and we cannot but think that the
  former is an imitation of the latter. At the same time he
  confesses that it is a good one, which in itself is high praise.
  The book is a refinement, an improvement, on Ross Brown's lacking
  the grotesque features of Yu-self, and more in accordance with
  the culture of the period.</p>
