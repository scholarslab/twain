          <p>Mr. Samuel L. Clemens, who is known to many of us, and
          ought to be known to all of us, as Mark Twain, was one of
          the passengers on the <i>Quaker City</i> when she took
          her ill-assorted party of excursionists to Europe and the
          East, and he has just given us, in a thick book of more
          than six hundred pages, a record of the tour. It might
          better have been a thinner book, for there is some dead
          wood in it, as there has to be in all books which are
          sold by book-agents and are not to be bought in stores.
          The rural-district reader likes to see that he has got
          his money's worth even more than he likes
          wood-engravings. At least, such is the faith in Hartford;
          and no man ever saw a book-agent with a small volume in
          his hand.</p>

          <p>But if some of the book is needless, none of it is
          really poor, and much of it very good. Mr. Clemens's plan
          of delivering an unvarnished tale, of giving just his own
          impressions of what he saw, at once made his work sure of
          some real value as well as much freshness, and his book
          is one to be commended merely as a book of travels. But,
          of course, the "American humor" is the great thing. It is
          not in the light of a traveller that one regards a
          gentleman who when during his wanderings in the Holy Land
          he comes upon the "tomb of Adam," which the monks
          exhibit, thus gives utterance to a natural burst of
          <a name="1">sentiment:</a></p>

            The tomb of Adam! How touching it was, here in a land
            of strangers, far away from home, and friends, and all
            who cared for me, thus to discover the grave of a blood
            relation. True, a distant one, but still a relation.
            The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its
            recognition. The fountain of my filial affection was
            stirred to its profoundest depths, and I gave way to
            tumultuous emotion. I leaned upon a pillar and burst
            into tears. I deem it no shame to have wept over the
            grave of my poor dead relative. Let him who would sneer
            at my emotion close this volume here, for he will find
            little to his taste in my journeyings through Holy
            Land. Noble old man--he did not live to see me--he did
            not live to see his child. And I--I--alas, I did not
            live to see <i>him</i>. Weighed down by sorrow and
            disappointment, he died before I was born--six thousand
            brief summers before I was born. But let us try to bear
            it with fortitude. Let us trust that he is better off
            where he is. Let us take comfort in the thought that
            his loss is our eternal gain.

          <p>All the prominent characteristics of our peculiar
          school of humorists -- their audacity, their extravagance
          and exaggeration -- Mr. Clemens displays in fulness in
          the course of his ramblings, and he has some merits which
          belong to his individual self, and which make him a very
          agreeable companion when he is at ease and natural --
          which is not always; for as he pads so, we must make free
          to tell him, does he sometimes grimace, and is
          professionally a humorist as he was professionally a
          book-maker. It will be a just punishment for him to
          reflect that no doubt many a farmer will read all his
          jokes -- the good ones as well as these bad ones we are
          speaking to him about -- with profound gravity and
          unshaking belief in them as so much serious log-book.</p>

          <p>There is, besides those we have mentioned, another
          characteristic of "American humor," which consists in a
          certain sort of what may be called fatuousness. When the
          man in the stage-coach, riding along with "the great
          moral showman" without knowing him, kept on telling him,
          "some of Artemus Ward's jokes," and at the end of each
          one of them punched his companion in the side and said,
          "What a damned fool the fellow is!" he was not the worst
          critic that Artemus ever had. Nearly all his jokes have
          in them a display of mental helplessness -- not to say
          imbecility -- a drifting along of the mind from one topic
          to another, suggested but not really connected, topic,
          and are largely dependent upon this for their humorous
          effect. The same thing may be seen -- though not nearly
          so unmixed nor so often -- in the efforts of Mr. Josh
          Billings. The humor in the Nasby Papers consists rather
          in Mr. Locke's conception of the low, "dough-face"
          Democrat than in anything strictly humorous that is said
          or done by him after he is made, and the Cross-roads
          pastor and postmaster gives no exhibition of the trait
          mentioned. But the author of <i>The Innocents Abroad</i>
          has some of it -- though something of what he has is
          acquired and imitative, we should say -- and may be taken
          to be rather more nearly Artemus Ward's successor in this
          line than either of the other humorists to whom we have
          referred.</p>
