        <p>Everybody has written about the Grotto del Cane and its
        poisonous vapors, from Pliny down to Smith, and every
        tourist has held a dog over its floor by the legs to test
        the capabilities of the place. The dog dies in a minute and
        a half--a chicken instantly. As a general thing, strangers
        who crawl in there to sleep do not get up until they are
        called. And then they don't either. The stranger that
        ventures to sleep there takes a permanent contract. I
        wanted to see this grotto. I resolved to take a dog and
        hold him myself; suffocate him a little, and time him;
        suffocate him some more and then finish him. We reached the
        grotto at about three in the afternoon, and proceeded at
        once to make the experiments. But now, an important
        difficulty presented itself. After I had taken off my coat
        and bathed a handkerchief with cologne, and tied it over my
        face, and got all ready, and was wrought up to the highest
        pitch of enthusiasm, I recollected that we hadn't got any
        dog. This toned me down some. Well, I thought the matter
        over, and concluded to go back to a house, about half a
        mile away, where I had seen a dog, and see if I could
        borrow it. Brown grumbled a good deal, for the day was hot,
        but my interest was hot, too, and we started. And so we
        tramped, tramped, tramped, till I thought we had walked ten
        miles, and at last we reached the house, almost fagged out.
        We sat there and chatted awhile, and dropped gently into
        the subject of the dog, and found that the woman who owned
        him was prejudiced against loaning him out to be
        experimented on with poisoned air. It was singular, but we
        had no time to discuss the foolish prejudices of "them
        pheasants," as Brown calls the peasantry, and so we just
        bought the dog, out and out, and started back. It was a
        long pull, and a weary one. Pull is the correct word,
        because the dog didn't want to come, and so we had to haul
        him, turn about, by a long rope he had around his neck.
        Sometimes that dog would sit down and brace his fore-paws,
        and it took both of us to start him; and when he did come
        he would come with a yelp, a skip and a jump, and then he
        would prance twenty steps to the right and twenty to the
        left with his paws in the air and collar half over his
        ears, and cavort around and carry on like a lunatic. And
        Brown would "rair back" on the rope and sweat and swear. He
        swore at me, too, for wanting to take so much trouble just
        to try some foolish experiments. This person has no
        appreciation of science.</p>

        <p>Well, toward sunset we got the dog to the place, and I
        took off my coat in a fever of excitement, and rolled up my
        sleeves, and saturated my handkerchief again and tied it
        over my nose. And then--just then, after all my trouble and
        vexation, the dog went up and smelt Brown's breath and laid
        down and died.</p>
