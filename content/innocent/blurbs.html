        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Hartford (Ct.) Courant.</p>

        <p>That the odd genius who described the "Jumping Frog,"
        should go to see and describe the art-treasures of Europe
        and the ruins of Egypt and the Holy Land, has something in
        it very comical. Mark Twain is a true Californian, with the
        original, quaint humor of the Pacific; a very shrewd
        observer, not by any means unpoetical, but yet delighting
        to take the traditional poetry out of things. You may be
        sure that if he went to Italy or Jerusalem he would not
        idealize, but would try to photograph. His very
        exaggerations are all of the disenchanting sort, and are a
        very fair set-off to the usual rhapsodies of most tourists,
        who see what they have been educated to expect, and who
        have tradition so soaked into them that if they sat
        shivering in Naples in January, with snow in the streets
        and ice in the fountains, they would write home about
        sunny, delicious Italy. We doubt if the classic lands ever
        had exactly such a traveler through them as Mark Twain, who
        went out on the famous Quaker City excursion to the Holy
        Land, with a lot of passengers collected especially, it
        seemed to him, for the Holy Land, and this book is a
        dreadfully real, also a whimsical record of what they did
        and what they didn't do and see, with sketches of the
        pilgrims that all of them cannot regard with complacency.
        This record has been put into a large and handsomely
        printed volume of 651-pages, illustrated with two hundred
        and thirty-four cuts of various sorts, views from
        photographs, portraits, odd costumes, characters, scenes
        occurring on shipboard and on land, grave, funny, absurd,
        but a very good accompaniment to the text. The book has a
        great deal of entertainment in it. It has bits of excellent
        real description, and when Twain tries to reproduce a scene
        or describe a place, he does it with wonderful
        faithfulness. The author is not straining to be funny; he
        is not trying to make a joke book; and there is nothing in
        it of that painfully unnatural sort of wit that is so
        wearisome. Very few will be able to read it without
        laughing at least half the time. It may be absurd, but it
        certainly is funny. In the midst of the most serious
        passages, some quaint observation is dropped that has a
        good deal of the quality of the best humor. To attempt
        anything like a criticism of Mark Twain's peculiar humor,
        or to try to explain why it is that he is able to make
        people laugh in spite of themselves, is unnecessary now.
        The book is full of bright things, shrewd observations,
        that lurk here and there, and must be read with the context
        to be appreciated.</p>

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the National (N.J.) Standard.</p>

        <p>This is the raciest book we have met with for many a
        day. Much as we had expected to be pleased, we must
        truthfully say that we had no idea so much humor, wit,
        geniality, fine description and good sense, could be
        contained within the covers of any one book. It is a
        splendid book in every meaning of the word. It is readable,
        enjoyable, laughable; it is keen, satirical, comical, and
        funny; its descriptions are beautiful, and its style is
        unique, and not of a common stamp; its morals are of a high
        tone, and cannot be impeached; it will give the reader a
        new view of the countries and people that it describes,
        showing them upon a side never before exposed. It is not a
        book filled with caricature and stale jokes, but a clear,
        well-written volume upon most interesting subjects, yet
        viewing them from an entirely new stand-point, and
        portraying them in an original and characteristic manner.
        We turned over the pages, without selection of pieces, and
        commenced reading, and invariably in less than two minutes
        we were boiling over with laughter. Our sides ache, and we
        lay aside the volume to rest, and to advise our friends and
        readers, one and all, to buy the book at the first
        opportunity, and read it through. It is full of excellent
        illustrations, in fact, taken all in all, is the jolliest,
        pleasantest, most fascinating, and handsomest volume we
        know of.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Meriden (Ct.) Republican.</p>

        <p>We hope our readers will purchase one new book just as
        soon as the Agent for this place shall put in an
        appearance. We refer to Mark Twain's new book entitled the
        "New Pilgrim's Progress." Mark Twain, always interesting,
        in this book has outrivaled himself. It is instructive,
        humorous, racy, full of quaint expressions that make you
        laugh unexpectedly, and before you are quite ready;
        critical, sometimes caustic, but always good natured; never
        prosy or wearisome. You begin the book and do not want to
        leave it till the last line is reached. Mark never
        describes a place, or sees a sight as others do. He is
        intensely original; and for us there is where the charm
        lies. It is a work permanently adapted for home reading
        aloud, and will invariably call up around the fireside a
        spirit of mirth and congeniality. No one can read its pages
        without feeling there is still beauty and sunshine in the
        world.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York Express.</p>

        <p>It is one of the most quaint and enjoyable books of
        travel that has been issued from the press. Certainly, Mark
        Twain succeeds in dispelling many of the old traditions
        which travelers have so long inflicted upon a confiding and
        long suffering public. He has gone over the ground with a
        genuine Yankee spirit, determining to see everything that
        is to be seen, to see it thoroughly and like a man of
        sense, to go into ecstacies [sic] over but few things, and
        to speak the plain, unvarnished truth under all
        circumstances. And this truth is told to us in such a
        winsome form, that we cannot but listen to it with
        agreeable sensations. Throughout runs an undercurrent of
        genuine native humor. Not what we are so apt to accept as
        such, and which is principally remarkable for its vulgarity
        and insipidity, but a real, crisp, tangible wit, that
        speaks in every line of the vitality, the vigorous honesty
        of the man, and of how fully he is imbued with all the
        better of the national characteristics. The book is a
        Golconda of wit and a very mine of sparkling
        entertainment.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Newark (N.J.) Register.</p>

        <p>It is a rare and wonderful combination. The humor is
        natural, never forced; the narrative is instructive, and
        the descriptive passages are some of the finest in the
        English language, abounding in choice expressions and
        beautiful metaphor.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Winsted (Ct.) Herald.</p>

        <p>The book opens richer and richer with every leaf you
        turn. The next best thing to having been one of this Holy
        Land excursion party, is to read this enchanting account of
        it. Indeed we guess the book will afford more enjoyment, in
        proportion to the cost, than did the trip itself. The book
        and the trip are just alike in one respect,--when you once
        get aboard you cannot get away from it. Perhaps, however,
        there will be no danger in accompanying the author as far
        as off Sandy Hook.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York Leader.</p>

        <p>Twain's irony is delicious and far-reaching; his
        facetious satire penetrates the very soul of appreciation.
        His drolleries are wickedly amusing. No one in full
        sympathy with humor can read Mark Twain's best things and
        not laugh heartily over them. Of course his latest work is
        his best, as it is his most elaborate effort.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Norwich Bulletin.</p>

        <p>If people don't stop laughing so immoderately in the
        dead hours of the night as to keep their neighbors awake,
        there will probably be trouble, that's all. The cause is
        said to be Mark Twain's new book, which everybody is
        reading. But that is no excuse.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York Herald.</p>

        <p>The "Innocents Abroad" must be read to be thoroughly
        enjoyed. It is an oasis in the desert of works on foreign
        travel, with which we are deluged at the present day. We
        have read it through with pleasure, and if Mark Twain will
        do no worse in future efforts at Book Making, we will
        always heartily welcome him at our desk.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Mohawk Valley Register.</p>

        <p>Buy it, and you will bless Mark Twain to the end of your
        existence.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Liberal Christian, N.Y.</p>

        <p>It is the record of a party on a holiday excursion, and
        every page is touched with the mirth of the happy
        merry-makers, and in every paragraph you feel a giggle if
        you do not hear a laugh. Here are no homilies; no essays on
        politics, no discussion of philosophies, or art, or
        archaeology; yet the book preaches nevertheless, and is
        full of health and aglow with that cheerful, hopeful,
        wholesome religion which has so much faith that it does not
        fear to crack a joke or to make one. It tells a great deal
        that other and more serious writers consider it beneath
        their dignity to tell, and it keeps striking the
        spear-point of its shrewd Yankee common sense into the
        cracks and crevices of antique customs and institutions
        until we half expect a general tumbling down of European
        civilization upon the Pilgrims' heads.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York Evening Post.</p>

        <p>It contains many scenes of real merriment that few can
        read without laughter. The cleverness, frankness, and
        catholic spirit of the writer are everywhere apparent.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Central Baptist, St. Louis, Mo.</p>

        <p>It abounds in historical and legendary lore, and written
        in the quaint and serio-comic strain peculiar to the
        author, will readily recommend itself to the public.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York Tribune.</p>

        <p>It is refreshing to find a tourist who does not care
        what other tourists have said before him. Mark Twain must
        be rated as the chief representative of that peculiar kind
        of humor whose principal elements are not bad spelling and
        verbal burlesque, for he does not practice these arts. The
        greater part of his book is pure fun, and its freshness is
        wonderfully well sustained.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the True American, Trenton, N.J.</p>

        <p>The work abounds in historical facts, descriptions of
        different countries and important personages, scenes and
        incidents, so bound together by wit, pleasantry and flashes
        of grotesque humor, as to make one of the most readable and
        amusing books of the period.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Providence (R.I.) Morning Herald.</p>

        <p>He has described with his rare skill and in his best
        style, the adventures of the company, as well as his own,
        which are among the best things in the book. He has left
        the beaten path of tourists, and has never pretended an
        admiration which he did not feel, or which was yielded in
        obedience merely to invariable custom. He claims to adhere
        to the truth and to facts, and in his book has shorn many
        of the venerable shams of the old world of the false charms
        they have pretended. The stand-point of the traveler is
        certainly new, and the book throughout bears the impress of
        originality. The piquant humor and rare felicity of the
        text is well sustained by the numerous engravings, upwards
        of two hundred in number, with which the book is
        embellished.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Providence (R.I.) Journal.</p>

        <p>The book is funny clear through; and if any doubt that
        fun can be sustained through so many pages, they can be
        cured by entering their names upon the subscription
        list.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Norwich (Ct.) Daily Advertiser.</p>

        <p>The drollest, funniest, most truthful and readable book
        of the season is Mark Twain's account of the pleasure trip
        of a party on the Quaker City, up the Mediterranean. The
        writer sees the humorous side of every thing, or gives a
        humorous side to serious things, but is not lacking in
        power to be sober and wise, and even eloquent, when those
        qualities seem necessary for effect. If any one wants a
        book that will really interest and instruct him about one
        of the most remarkable portions of the earth, and at the
        same time to keep in rollicking good humor, he cannot
        afford to be without this book.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York Times.</p>

        <p>About one-third of this pleasant book is given to the
        sacred parts of Asia Minor and Egypt--showing the mental
        proclivity of the majority on board the Quaker City. The
        volume is a large one of 650 pages, beautifully printed,
        and swarming with illustrations which, in their own way,
        are as effective and amusing as the letter press. It is
        altogether a very taking book; and a great many persons who
        would not care to read the graver accounts of travel
        through these world-renowned places, will find themselves
        very much interested in Mark Twain's humorous way of
        getting over the same ground.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Rochester Chronicle.</p>

        <p>Twain's book is valuable for pricking many of the
        bubbles and exploding the humbugs of European travel.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Newark (N.J.) Daily Advertiser.</p>

        <p>We have one earnest caution for our readers who may buy
        this book. The writers seeks to rest your ribs by
        occassional [sic] fine passages of true eloquence, or
        sentiment, or sensible description. But he does not
        succeed. The book must be taken in interrupted doses. There
        is more fun in it than it is safe to swallow at once.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Hartford (Ct.) Times.</p>

        <p>We are indebted to the publishers for a copy of a new
        and really unique volume of travels by that rollicking
        humorist, "Mark Twain." It is a lively, laughter-exciting
        book, such as one rarely meets among volumes of travels;
        yet the fun is not the only feature of the book. It abounds
        in interesting information, conveyed in a wide range of
        facts, adventures, and personal experiences. It is fresh,
        racy and sparkling as a glass of iced champagne, and a good
        deal better for the health and digestion. Seated under a
        shady tree, with this instructive picture book before him,
        one can, in most moods, be better entertained than with a
        living companion. It gives us living scenes and pictures of
        life and experience in far distant lands, so graphically
        portrayed that the book will make an attractive addition to
        the treasures of the library and the drawing-table, for the
        benefit of one's self or friends in a winter evening.
        Everybody should buy and read it.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New Jersey Journal.</p>

        <p>Criticism of the work is almost impossible; as
        sufficient gravity of countenance for the purpose, can
        hardly be maintained over the volume. To think of, or look
        at it, is to smile, but to read it is to overwhelm all
        criticism with uncontrolable [sic] laughter. It is truly an
        original affair, and does credit to its author. He treats
        of subjects of which we supposed we were fully acquainted
        in such a manner that we come to the conclusion finally
        that we are swallowing sugar-coated statistics,--and are
        aware that we are digesting much useful and important
        information,--learning facts we never knew before,--getting
        glimpses of scenes and places from entirely new
        stand-points, and catching new and quaint ideas, expressed
        in the most original and funny manner. Altogether the book
        is a good one; one we can heartily recommend to our
        readers. It is pure in morals, and just the thing for
        fire-side reading. Buy this Book, say we, and, our word for
        it, you will not regret the outlay.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Springfield (Mass.) Union.</p>

        <p>This is one of the most readable and entertaining books
        of the season. For years the quaint humor of Mark Twain has
        enlivened the columns of the newspapers, and few readers
        finish a column of his correspondence without wishing, like
        Oliver Twist, for more. The present volume, while brimfull
        [sic] of humor in almost every page, is by no means a mere
        jest book, but contains more information in regard to the
        places visited by the "Pilgrims" than would be gathered
        from many dry books of travel. It is profusely illustrated,
        and the views, which profess to be real, are authentic and
        well-executed; while the comic and fancy sketches aptly
        illustrate the drollery of the text.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Springfield (Mass.) Republican.</p>

        <p>Mr. Clemens brings to his work a free spirit, a lively
        fancy and an indescribable emancipation from old trammels
        of thought and feeling. He is as different from the stock
        traveler as he is from Montague or Bunyan's Pilgrim,--sees
        things that nobody else saw, says things that nobody else
        ever thought of saying, and throws over his whole work the
        charm of an uncouth freshness.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York World.</p>

        <p>No American book of travels contains so much genuine
        fun. It aims to entertain and it does. There is a genuine
        American tone about it which is refreshing to see after the
        snobberies of some other American travelers.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the New York Sun.</p>

        <p>He pricks a great many bubbles blown by previous
        travelers, both in print and out of it; and where anything
        seemed to him an imposition or a delusion, he bluntly says
        so. One cannot read half a dozen pages of the book without
        enjoying as many hearty laughs at droll fancies of the
        author and the comical tint which he gives to every
        picture. Aside from its mirth the book abounds in clear and
        graphic description, and now and then the author indulges
        in sentimental writing and bursts of eloquence quite in
        contrast with his levity on other pages. Altogether this
        book is both instructive and entertaining, which is more
        than can be said of all travelers' tales.</p>
        <hr />

        <p> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; From the Paterson Daily Guardian, N.J.</p>

        <p>It is a large book, but a reading of a few pages is
        sufficient to convince the reader that Mark is equal to it,
        and could stand a good deal larger one. The public could
        also.</p>

        <p>The author of this work during the past winter delivered
        in scores of cities in the West, his popular lecture termed
        "The American Vandal Abroad," to large and delighted
        audiences. The material for that lecture was drawn from
        this book, and is a fair specimen of its style and quality.
        The lecture is spoken of in the following manner by the
        press:</p>

        <p>LIBRARY ASSOCIATION--LECTURE OF "MARK TWAIN."--We shall
        attempt no transcript of this lecture, lest with unskillful
        hands we mar its beauty, for beauty and poetry it certainly
        possessed, though the production of a professed
        humorist.</p>

        <p>We know not which most to commend, the quaint
        utterances, the funny incidents, the good-natured recital
        of the characteristics of his harmless "Vandal," or the
        gems of beautiful description which sparkled all through
        his lecture. We expected to be amused, but we were taken by
        surprise when he carried us on the wings of his redundant
        fancy, away to the ruins, the cathedrals, and the monuments
        of the old world. There are some passages of gorgeous
        word-painting which haunt us like a remembered picture. We
        congratulate Mr. Twain upon having taken the tide of public
        favor "at the flood" in the lecture field, and having
        conclusively proved that a man may be a humorist without
        being a clown. He has elevated the profession by his
        graceful delivery and by recognizing in his audience
        something higher than merely a desire to laugh. We can
        assure the cities who are awaiting his coming, that a rich
        feast is in store for them, and Cleveland is proud to offer
        him the first laurel leaf in his role as lecturer, this
        side the "Rocky slope."</p>

        <p>MARK TWAIN'S LECTURE.--White's Hall was filled from
        cellar to garret, last night, by one of the best tickled
        audiences that ever assembled there to hear a lecture or
        see the speaker. Mark Twain tickled them. And he did it so
        easily and almost constantly, that they didn't know what
        they were laughing at more than half the time. Twain is
        witty, and his wit comes from his own fertile brain. His
        style is original; and his manner of speaking is not after
        the manner of men generally. His serious face and long
        drawn words are, of themselves, sufficient to make one
        laugh, even if there were not in every sentence expressed a
        sparkling gem of humor and original idea. His anecdotes,
        with which the lecture is replete, are rich, and, as he
        tells them, irresistibly funny. In some of his descriptions
        of European places and characters the lecturer delivers, at
        times, most eloquent passages, brilliant in thought and
        word. That Mark Twain is a success as a lecturer, as well
        as writer, we think no one who heard "The American Vandal
        Abroad," last night, will dispute.</p>

        <p>MARK TWAIN.--This combination of letters spells a name
        and designates a man for whom we have the most intense
        veneration. We had the privilege and pleasure of hearing
        his quaint and instructive lecture, the "American Vandal
        Abroad," on Saturday Evening last. A large and appreciative
        audience greeted him, all anxious to hear and see the man
        who had placed himself so high in their esteem by the many
        brilliant witticisms from time to time seized with avidity
        by the public press, and through it placed before the
        world. Mr. Twain was heard and admired. New and warm
        friends were added to his list and the old ones retained.
        Such a deep interest was manifested in the lecture that at
        the close a general dissatisfaction was apparent that he
        did not speak longer. It seemed too short, but upon
        consulting the time it was discovered to the great surprise
        of all that he had talked one hour and a half. A sermon of
        the same dimensions to the self-same audience would have
        found many dozing, and at the hour of high noon! The
        lecture was a grand success. Everybody was pleased. He is
        about to issue a work of some six hundred pages, "The
        Innocents Abroad, or the New Pilgrim's Progress." We long
        to see it, and predict for it an extensive sale.</p>

        <p>"MARK TWAIN" ON THE SPHYNX [sic].--Among the gems of
        fine description in the lecture of Mark Twain, Tuesday
        evening, that of the mysterious Sphynx thrilled his
        audience with admiration.</p>

        <p>MARK TWAIN'S NEW BOOK, "THE INNOCENTS ABROAD, OR THE NEW
        PILGRIM'S PROGRESS."--Advance sheets of the new work have
        incidentally come under our notice--and from them we are
        prepared to speak highly of Mr. Clemens' prospective book.
        It has for its foundation a description of the sights and
        scenes of famous places abroad, while they are treated in
        that peculiarly attractive vein of power and genuine humor,
        which has made him widely famous, and placed him at the
        head of the witty writers of America. Mr. Clemens, however,
        is something besides a literary humorist. There occurs in
        his writing a blending of sentiment and thought as fine and
        striking as they are beautiful and sparkling--ideas as
        clear and penetrating as his humor is fresh. From what we
        have seen of his new book we are led to believe that it
        will do much towards advancing his reputation, and
        establish it on an enduring basis. That it will be a
        success is already assured.</p>

        <p>By a private note from "Mark Twain," we learn that he is
        about to issue his new book, "The New Pilgrim's Progress,"
        and then transform himself into a pilgrim again and start
        for California. The first part of the information we hail
        with the utmost satisfaction, but we regret that he is soon
        to leave the Atlantic coast. However, as many people will
        kill themselves with laughter over his book, he might be
        subject here to the annoyance of frequent arrests for being
        accessory before the fact to numerous cases of
        manslaughter. In California he would be safe among his
        earlier friends, who know him better, and would let him off
        more easily.</p>
