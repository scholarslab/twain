        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tomb of Adam</h2><br />
        <br />

        <p>But the feature of the place is a short column that
        rises from the middle of the marble pavement of the chapel,
        and marks the exact <i>centre of the earth.</i> The most
        reliable traditions tell us that this was known to be the
        earth's centre, ages ago, and that when Christ was upon
        earth he set all doubts upon the subject at rest forever,
        by stating with his own lips that the tradition was
        correct. Remember, He said that that particular column
        stood upon the centre of the world. If the centre of the
        world changes, the column changes its position accord-
        ingly. This column has moved three different times of its
        own accord. This is because, in great convulsions of
        nature, at three different times, masses of the earth --
        whole ranges of mountains, probably -- have flown off into
        space, thus lessening the diameter of the earth, and
        changing the exact locality of its centre by a point or
        two. This is a very curious and interesting circumstance,
        and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who would
        make us believe that it is not possible for any portion of
        the earth to fly off into space.</p>

        <p>To satisfy himself that this spot was really the centre
        of the earth, a sceptic once paid well for the privilege of
        ascending to the dome of the church to see if the sun gave
        him a shadow at noon. He came down perfectly convinced. The
        day was very cloudy and the sun threw no shadows at all;
        but the man was satisfied that if the sun had come out and
        made shadows it could not have made any for him. Proofs
        like these are not to be set aside by the idle tongues of
        cavilers. To such as are not bigoted, and are willing to be
        convinced, they carry a conviction that nothing can ever
        shake.</p>

        <p>If even greater proofs than those I have mentioned are
        wanted, to satisfy the headstrong and the foolish that this
        is the genuine centre of the earth, they are here. The
        greatest of them lies in the fact that from under this very
        column was taken the <i>dust from which Adam was made.</i>
        This can surely be regarded in the light of a settler. It
        is not likely that the original first man would have been
        made from an inferior quality of earth when it was entirely
        convenient to get first quality from the world's centre.
        This will strike any reflecting mind forcibly. That Adam
        was formed of dirt procured in this very spot is amply
        proven by the fact that in six thousand years no man has
        ever been able to prove that the dirt was <i>not</i>
        procured here whereof he was made.</p>

        <p>It is a singular circumstance that right under the roof
        of this same great church, and not far away from that
        illustrious column, Adam himself, the father of the human
        race, lies buried. There is no question that he is actually
        buried in the grave which is pointed out as his -- there
        can be none -- because it has never yet been proven that
        that grave is not the grave in which he is buried.</p>

        <p>The tomb of Adam! How touching it was, here in a land of
        strangers, far away from home, and friends, and all who
        cared for me, thus to discover the grave of a blood
        relation. True, a distant one, but still a relation. The
        unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition. The
        fountain of my filial aflfection was stirred to its
        profoundest depths, and I gave way to tumultuous emotion. I
        leaned upon a pillar and burst into tears. I deem it no
        shame to have wept over the grave of my poor dead relative.
        Let him who would sneer at my emotion close this volume
        here, for he will find little to his taste in my
        journeyings through Holy Land. Noble old man -- he did not
        live to see me -- he did not live to see his child. And I
        -- I -- alas, I did not live to see <i>him</i>. Weighed
        down by sorrow and disappointment, he died before I was
        born -- six thousand brief summers before I was born. But
        let us try to bear it with fortitude. Let us trust that he
        is better off where he is. Let us take comfort in the
        thought that his loss is our eternal gain.</p>
