<hr><i>Page 217</i><br>

<p>THIS Venice, which was a haughty. invincible, magnificent Republic for nearly fourteen
hundred years; whose armies compelled the world's applause whenever and wherever they battled;
whose navies well nigh held dominion of the seas, and whose merchant fleets whitened the
remotest oceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of every clime, is fallen a
prey to poverty, neglect and melancholy decay. Six hundred years ago, Venice was the Autocrat
of Commerce; her mart was the great commercial centre, the distributing-house from whence the
enormous trade of the Orient was spread abroad over the Western world. To-day her piers are
deserted, her warehouses are empty, her merchant fleets are vanished, her armies and her navies
are but memories. Her glory is departed, and with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces
about her she sits among her stagnant lagoons, forlorn and beggared, forgotten of the world. She
that in her palmy days commanded the commerce of a hemisphere and made the weal or woe of
nations with a beck of her puissant finger, is become the humblest among the peoples of the
earth,--a peddler of glass beads for women, and trifling toys and trinkets for school-girls and
children.

</p><p>The venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject for flippant speech or the
idle gossipping of tourists. It seems a sort of sacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that
pictures her to us softly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin and her
desolation from our view. One ought, indeed, to turn away from her rags, her poverty and her
humiliation, and think of her only as she was when she 

<hr><i>Page 218</i><br>
sunk the fleets of Charlemagne; when she humbled Frederick Barbarossa or waved her victorious
banners above the battlements of Constantinople.

</p><p>We reached Venice at eight in the evening, and entered a hearse belonging to the Grand
Hotel d'Europe. At any rate, it was more like a hearse than any thing else, though to speak by the
card, it was a gondola. And this was the storied gondola of Venice!--the fairy boat in which the
princely cavaliers of the olden time were wont to cleave the waters of the moonlit canals and look
the eloquence of love into the soft eyes of patrician beauties, while the gay gondolier in silken
doublet touched his guitar and sang as only gondoliers can sing! This the famed gondola and this
the gorgeous gondolier!--the one an inky, rusty old canoe with a sable hearse-body clapped on to
the middle of it, and the other a mangy, barefooted guttersnipe with a portion of his raiment on
exhibition which should have been sacred from public scrutiny. Presently, as he turned a corner
and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two long rows of towering, untenanted buildings,
the gay gondolier began to sing, true to the traditions of his race. I stood it a little while. Then I
said:

</p><p>"Now, here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo, I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger, but I
am not going to have my feelings lacerated by any such caterwauling as that. If that goes on, one
of us has got to take water. It is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice have been blighted
forever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier; this system of destruction shall go
no farther; I will accept the hearse, under protest, and you may fly your flag of truce in peace, but
here I register a dark and bloody oath that you shan't sing. Another yelp, and overboard you go."

</p><p>I began to feel that the old Venice of song and story had departed forever. But I was too
hasty. In a few minutes we swept gracefully out into the Grand Canal, and under the mellow
moonlight the Venice of poetry and romance stood revealed. Right from the water's edge rose
long lines of stately palaces of marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly hither and


<hr><i>Page 219</i><br>

thither and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys; ponderous stone bridges
threw their shadows athwart the glittering waves. There was life and motion everywhere, and yet
everywhere there was a hush, a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret enterprises
of bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in moonbeams and half in mysterious shadows, the grim
old mansions of the Republic seemed to have an expression about them of having an eye out for
just such enterprises as these at that same moment. Music came floating over the waters--Venice
was complete.

</p><p>It was a beautiful picture--very soft and dreamy and beautiful. But what was this Venice
to compare with the Venice of midnight? Nothing. There was a f&ecirc;te--a grand f&ecirc;te in
honor of some saint who had been instrumental in checking the cholera three hundred years ago,
and all Venice was abroad on the water. It was no common affair, for the Venetians did not know
how soon they might need the saint's services again, now that the cholera was spreading every
where. So in one vast space--say a third of a mile wide and two miles long--were collected two
thousand gondolas, and every one of them had from two to ten, twenty and even thirty colored
lanterns suspended about it, and from four to a dozen occupants. Just as far as the eye could
reach, these painted lights were massed together--like a vast garden of many-colored flowers,
except that these blossoms were never still; they were ceaselessly gliding in and out, and mingling
together, and seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazy evolutions. Here and
there a strong red, green, or blue glare from a rocket that was struggling to get away, splendidly
illuminated all the boats around it. Every gondola that swam by us, with its crescents and
pyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft, and lighting up the faces of the young and the
sweet-scented and lovely below, was a picture; and the reflections of those lights, so long, so
slender, so numberless, so many-colored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves, was a
picture likewise, and one that was enchantingly beautiful. Many and many a party of young ladies
and gentlemen had their state gondolas hand- 


<hr><i>Page 220</i><br>
somely decorated, and ate supper on board, bringing their swallow-tailed, white-cravatted varlets
to wait upon them, and having their tables tricked out as if for a bridal supper. They had brought
along the costly globe lamps from their drawing-rooms, and the lace and silken curtains from the
same places, I suppose. And they had also brought pianos and guitars, and they played and sang
operas, while the plebeian paper-lanterned gondolas from the suburbs and the back alleys crowded
around to stare and listen.

</p><p>There was music every where--chorusses, string bands, brass bands, flutes, every thing. I
was so surrounded, walled in, with music, magnificence and loveliness, that I became inspired
with the spirit of the scene, and sang one tune myself. However, when I observed that the other
gondolas had sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, I stopped.

</p><p>The f&ecirc;te was magnificent. They kept it up the whole night long, and I never
enjoyed myself better than I did while it lasted.

</p><p>What a funny old city this Queen of the Adriatic is! Narrow streets, vast, gloomy marble
palaces, black with the corroding damps of centuries, and all partly submerged; no dry

<hr><i>Page 221</i><br>
land visible any where, and no sidewalks worth mentioning; if you want to go to church, to the
theatre, or to the restaurant, you must call a gondola. It must be a paradise for cripples, for verily
a man has no use for legs here.

</p><p>For a day or two the place looked so like an overflowed Arkansas town, because of its
currentless waters laving the very doorsteps of all the houses, and the cluster of boats made fast
under the windows, or skimming in and out of the alleys and by-ways, that I could not get rid of
the impression that there was nothing the matter here but a spring freshet, and that the river
would fall in a few weeks and leave a dirty high-water mark on the houses, and the streets full of
mud and rubbish.

</p><p>In the glare of day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under the charitable moon her
stained palaces are white again, their battered sculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old city
seems crowned once more with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago. It is easy,
then, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and fair ladies--with Shylocks in
gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans upon the rich argosies of Venetian commerce--with
Othellos and Desdemonas, with Iagos and Roderigos--with noble fleets and victorious legions
returning from the wars. In the treacherous sunlight we see Venice decayed, forlorn,
poverty-stricken, and commerceless--forgotten and utterly insignificant. But in the moonlight, her
fourteen centuries of greatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she the princeliest
among the nations of the earth.</p>

<l>And gliding up her streets, as in a dream, </l>
<l>So smoothly, silently--by many a dome, </l>
<l>Mosque-like, and many a stately portico, </l>
<l>The statues ranged along an azure sky; </l></font>

<p>What would one naturally wish to see first in Venice? The Bridge of Sighs, of course--and
next the Church and the Great Square of St. Mark, the Bronze Horses, and the famous Lion of St.
Mark.

</p><p>We intended to go to the Bridge of Sighs, but happened into the Ducal Palace first--a
building which necessarily figures largely in Venetian poetry and tradition. In the Senate Chamber
of the ancient Republic we wearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings by
Tintoretto and Paul Veronese, but nothing struck us forcibly except the one thing that strikes
<i>all</i> strangers forcibly--a black square in the midst of a gallery of portraits. In one long row,
around the great hall, were painted the portraits of the Doges of Venice (venerable fellows, with
flowing white beards, for of the three hundred Senators eligible to the office, the oldest was
usually chosen Doge,) and each had its complimentary inscription attached--till you came to the
place that should have had Marino Faliero's picture in it, and that was blank and black--blank,
except that it bore a terse inscription, saying that the conspirator had died for his crime. It seemed
cruel to keep that pitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappy wretch had been
in his grave five hundred years.

</p><p>At the head of the Giant's Staircase, where Marino Faliero was beheaded, and where the
Doges were crowned in ancient times, two small slits in the stone wall were pointed out--two
harmless, insignificant orifices that would never attract a stranger's attention--yet these were the
terrible Lions' Mouths! The heads were gone (knocked off by the French during their occupation
of Venice,) but these were the throats, down which went the anonymous accusation, thrust in
secretly at dead of night by an enemy, that doomed many an innocent man to walk the Bridge of
Sighs and descend into the dungeon which

<hr><i>Page 223</i><br>

none entered and hoped to see the sun again. This was in the old days when the Patricians alone
governed Venice--the common herd had no vote and no voice. There were one thousand five
hundred Patricians; from these, three hundred Senators were chosen; from the Senators a Doge
and a Council of Ten were selected, and by secret ballot the Ten chose from their own number a
Council of Three. All these were Government spies, then, and every spy was under surveillance
himself--men spoke in whispers in Venice, and no man trusted his neighbor--not always his own
brother. No man knew who the Council of Three were--not even the Senate, not even the Doge;
the members of that dread tribunal met at night in a chamber to themselves, masked, and robed
from head to foot in scarlet cloaks, and did not even know each other, unless by voice. It was
their duty to judge heinous political crimes, and from their sentence there was no appeal. A nod to
the executioner was sufficient. The doomed man was marched down a hall and out at a door-way
into the covered Bridge of Sighs, through it and into the dungeon and unto his death. At no time
in his transit was he visible to any save his conductor. If a man had an enemy in those old days,
the cleverest thing he could do was to slip a note for the Council of Three into the Lion's mouth,
saying "This man is plotting against the Government." If the awful Three found no proof, ten to
one they would drown him anyhow, because he was a deep rascal, since his plots were unsolvable.
Masked judges and masked executioners, with unlimited power, and no appeal from their
judgements, in that hard, cruel age, were not likely to be lenient with men they suspected yet
could not convict.

</p><p>We walked through the hall of the Council of Ten, and presently entered the infernal den
of the Council of Three.

</p><p>The table around which they had sat was there still, and likewise the stations where the
masked inquisitors and executioners formerly stood, frozen, upright and silent, till they received a
bloody order, and then, without a word, moved off like the inexorable machines they were, to
carry it out. The frescoes on the walls were startlingly suited to the place. In 

<hr><i>Page 224</i><br>

all the other saloons, the halls, the great state chambers of the palace, the walls and ceilings were
bright with gilding, rich with elaborate carving, and resplendent with gallant pictures of Venetian
victories in war, and Venetian display in foreign courts, and hallowed with portraits of the Virgin,
the Saviour of men, and the holy saints that preached the Gospel of Peace upon earth--but here, in
dismal contrast, were none but pictures of death and dreadful suffering!--not a living figure but
was writhing in torture, not a dead one but was smeared with blood, gashed with wounds, and
distorted with the agonies that had taken away its life! 

</p><p>From the palace to the gloomy prison is but a step--one might almost jump across the
narrow canal that intervenes. The ponderous stone Bridge of Sighs crosses it at the second story--a bridge that is a covered tunnel--you can not be seen when you walk in it. It is partitioned
lengthwise, and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in ancient times,
and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the Three had doomed to lingering
misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons, or to sudden and mysterious death. Down below the
level of the water, by the light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells
where many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn miseries of solitary
imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked, unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his
useless tongue forgetting its office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no longer
marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away from all cheerful sounds, buried in
the silence of a tomb; forgotten by his helpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them
forever; losing his own memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there;
devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into the cell by unseen hands,
and troubling his worn spirit no more with hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free;
ceasing to scratch vain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself, could see
them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling child-

<hr><i>Page 225</i><br>
ishness, lunacy ! Many and many a sorrowful story like this these stony walls could tell if they
could but speak.

</p><p>In a little narrow corridor, near by, they showed us where many a prisoner, after lying in
the dungeons until he was forgotten by all save his persecutors, was brought by masked
executioners and garroted, or sewed up in a sack, passed through a little window to a boat, at
dead of night, and taken to some remote spot and drowned.

</p><p>They used to show to visitors the implements of torture wherewith the Three were wont
to worm secrets out of the accused--villainous machines for crushing thumbs; the stocks where a
prisoner sat immovable while water fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more than
humanity could bear; and a devilish contrivance of steel, which inclosed a prisoner's head like a
shell, and crushed it slowly by means of a screw. It bore the stains of blood that had trickled
through its joints long ago, and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer rested his
elbow comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of the sufferer perishing within.

</p><p>Of course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory of Venice, with its
pavements worn and broken by the passing feet of a thousand years of plebeians and patricians--The Cathedral of St. Mark. It is built entirely of precious marbles, brought from the Orient--nothing in its composition is domestic. Its hoary traditions make it an object of absorbing interest
to even the most careless stranger, and thus far it had interest for me; but no further. I could not
go into ecstacies over its coarse mosaics, its unlovely Byzantine architecture, or its five hundred
curious interior columns from as many distant quarries. Every thing was worn out--every block of
stone was smooth and almost shapeless with the polishing hands and shoulders of loungers who
devoutly idled here in by-gone centuries and have died and gone to the dev--no, simply died, I
mean.

</p><p>Under the altar repose the ashes of St. Mark--and Matthew, Luke and John, too, for all I
know. Venice reveres those relics above all things earthly. For fourteen hundred years St. Mark
has been her patron saint. Every thing about the city 

<hr><i>Page 226</i><br>
seems to be named after him or so named as to refer to him in some way--so named, or some
purchase rigged in some way to scrape a sort of hurrahing acquaintance with him. That seems to
be the idea. To be on good terms with St. Mark, seems to be the very summit of Venetian
ambition. They say St. Mark had a tame lion, and used to travel with him--and every where that
St. Mark went, the lion was sure to go. It was his protector, his friend, his librarian. And so the
Winged Lion of St. Mark, with the open Bible under his paw, is a favorite emblem in the grand
old city. It casts its shadow from the most ancient pillar in Venice, in the Grand Square of St.
Mark, upon the throngs of free citizens below, and has so done for many a long century. The
winged lion is found every where--and doubtless here, where the winged lion is, no harm can
come.

<hr><i>Page 227</i><br>
</p><p>St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was martyred, I think. However, that has
nothing to do with my legend. About the founding of the city of Venice--say four hundred and
fifty years after Christ--(for Venice is much younger than any other Italian city,) a priest dreamed
that an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought to Venice, the city could
never rise to high distinction among the nations; that the body must be captured, brought to the
city, and a magnificent church built over it; and that if ever the Venetians allowed the Saint to be
removed from his new resting-place, in that day Venice would perish from off the face of the the
earth. The priest proclaimed his dream, and forthwith Venice set about procuring the corpse of St.
Mark. One expedition after another tried and failed, but the project was never abandoned during
four hundred years. At last it was secured by stratagem, in the year eight hundred and something.
The commander of a Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the bones, separated them, and
packed them in vessels filled with lard. The religion of Mahomet causes its devotees to abhor
anything that is in the nature of pork, and so when the Christian was stopped by the officers at the
gates of the city, they only glanced once into his precious baskets, then turned up their noses at
the unholy lard, and let him go. The bones were buried in the vaults of the grand cathedral, which
had been waiting long years to receive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were
secured. And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if those holy ashes were stolen
away, the ancient city would vanish like a dream, and its foundations be buried forever in the
unremembering sea.
