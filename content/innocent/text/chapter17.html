<hr><i>page 159</i><br>
We had a pleasant journey of it seaward again.  We found
that for the three past nights our ship had been in a state of war.  The first
night the sailors of a British ship, being happy with grog, came down on the
pier and challenged our sailors to a free fight.  They accepted with alacrity,
repaired to the pier, and gained--their share of a drawn battle.  Several
bruised and bloody members of both parties were carried off by the police and
imprisoned until the following morning.  The next night the British boys came
again to renew the fight, but our men had had strict orders to remain on board
and out of sight.  They did so, and the besieging party grew noisy and more and
more abusive as the fact became apparent (to them) that our men were afraid to
come out.  They went away finally with a closing burst of ridicule and
offensive epithets.  The third night they came again and were more obstreperous
than ever.  They swaggered up and down the almost deserted pier and hurled
curses, obscenity, and stinging sarcasms at our crew.  It was more than human
nature could bear.  The executive officer ordered our men ashore--with
instructions not to fight.  They charged the British and gained a brilliant
victory.  I probably would not have mentioned this war had it ended
differently.  But I travel to learn, and I still remember that they picture no
French defeats in the battle galleries of Versailles.<p>
It was like home to us to step on board the comfortable ship again and smoke
and lounge about her breezy decks.  And yet it was not altogether like home,
either, because so <hr><i>page 160</i><br>
many members of the family were away.  We missed some
pleasant faces which we would rather have found at dinner, and at night there
were gaps in the euchre parties which could not be satisfactorily filled.
"Moult" was in England, Jack in Switzerland, Charley in Spain.  Blucher was
gone, none could tell where.  But we were at sea again, and we had the stars
and the ocean to look at, and plenty of room to meditate in.<p>
In due time the shores of Italy were sighted, and as we stood gazing from the
decks, early in the bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoa rose up
out of the sea and flung back the sunlight from her hundred palaces.<p>
Here we rest for the present--or rather, here we have been trying to rest, for
some little time, but we run about too much to accomplish a great deal in that
line.<p>
I would like to remain here.  I had rather not go any further.  There may be
prettier women in Europe, but I doubt it. The population of Genoa is 120,000;
two-thirds of these are women, I think, and at least two-thirds of the women
are beautiful.  They are as dressy and as tasteful and as graceful as they
could possibly be without being angels.  However, angels are not very dressy, I
believe.  At least the angels in pictures are not--they wear nothing but wings.
But these Genoese women do look so charming.  Most of the young demoiselles are
robed in a cloud of white from head to foot, though many trick themselves out
more elaborately.  Nine-tenths of them wear nothing on their heads but a filmy
sort of veil, which falls down their backs like a white mist.  They are very
fair, and many of them have blue eyes, but black and dreamy dark brown ones are
met with oftenest.<p>
The ladies and gentlemen of Genoa have a pleasant fashion of promenading in a
large park on the top of a hill in the center of the city, from six till nine
in the evening, and then eating ices in a neighboring garden an hour or two
longer.  We went to the park on Sunday evening.  Two thousand persons were
present, chiefly young ladies and gentlemen.  The gentlemen were dressed in the
very latest Paris fashions, and the <hr><i>page 161</i><br>
robes of the ladies glinted among the trees
like so many snowflakes.  The multitude moved round and round the park in a
great procession.  The bands played, and so did the fountains; the moon and the
gas lamps lit up the scene, and altogether it was a brilliant and an animated
picture.  I scanned every female face that passed, and it seemed to me that all
were handsome.  I never saw such a freshet of loveliness before.  I did not see
how a man of only ordinary decision of character could marry here, because
before he could get his mind made up he would fall in love with somebody
else.<p>
Never smoke any Italian tobacco.  Never do it on any account.  It makes me
shudder to think what it must be made of.  You cannot throw an old cigar "stub"
down anywhere, but some vagabond will pounce upon it on the instant.  I like to
smoke a good deal, but it wounds my sensibilities to see one of these
stub-hunters watching me out of the corners
<hr><i>page 162</i><br>
of his hungry eyes and calculating
how long my cigar will be likely to last.  It reminded me too painfully of that
San Francisco undertaker who used to go to sickbeds with his watch in his hand
and time the corpse.  One of these stub-hunters followed us all over the park
last night, and we never had a smoke that was worth anything.  We were always
moved to appease him with the stub before the cigar was half gone, because he
looked so viciously anxious.  He regarded us as his own legitimate prey, by
right of discovery, I think, because he drove off several other professionals
who wanted to take stock in us.<p>
Now, they surely must chew up those old stubs and dry and sell them for smoking
tobacco.  Therefore, give your custom to other than Italian brands of the
article.<p>
"The Superb" and the "City of Palaces" are names which Genoa has held for
centuries.  She is full of palaces, certainly, and the palaces are sumptuous
inside, but they are very rusty without and make no pretensions to
architectural magnificence.  "Genoa the Superb" would be a felicitous title if
it referred to the women.<p>
We have visited several of the palaces--immense thick-walled piles, with great
stone staircases, tessellated marble pavement on the floors (sometimes they
make a mosaicwork of intricate designs, wrought in pebbles or little fragments
of marble laid in cement), and grand <i>salons </i>hung with pictures by
Rubens, Guido, Titian, Paul Veronese, and so on, and portraits of heads of the
family in plumed helmets and gallant coats of mail, and patrician ladies in
stunning costumes of centuries ago.  But, of course, the folks were all out in
the country for the summer, and might not have known enough to ask us to dinner
if they had been at home, and so all the grand empty <i>salons, </i>with their
resounding pavements, their grim pictures of dead ancestors, and tattered
banners with the dust of bygone centuries upon them seemed to brood solemnly of
death and the grave, and our spirits ebbed away, and our cheerfulness passed
from us.  We never went up to the eleventh story.  We always began to suspect
ghosts.  There was <hr><i>page 163</i><br>
always an undertaker-looking servant along, too, who handed
us a program, pointed to the picture that began the list of the <i>salon </i>he
was in, and then stood stiff and stark and unsmiling in his petrified livery
till we were ready to move on to the next chamber, whereupon he marched sadly
ahead and took up another malignantly respectful position as before.  I wasted
so much time praying that the roof would fall in on these dispiriting flunkies
that I had but little left to bestow upon palace and pictures.<p>
And besides, as in Paris, we had a guide.  Perdition catch all the guides.
This one said he was the most gifted linguist in Genoa, as far as English was
concerned, and that only two persons in the city beside himself could talk the
language at all.  He showed us the birthplace of Christopher
Columbus,<br><i>page 164</i><br>
 and
after we had reflected in silent awe before it for fifteen minutes, he said it
was not the birthplace of Columbus, but of Columbus' grandmother! When we
demanded an explanation of his conduct he only shrugged his shoulders and
answered in barbarous Italian.  I shall speak further of this guide in a future
chapter.  All the information we got out of him we shall be able to carry along
with us, I think.<p>
I have not been to church so often in a long time as I have in the last few
weeks.  The people in these old lands seem to make churches their specialty.
Especially does this seem to be the case with the citizens of Genoa.  I think
there is a church every three or four hundred yards all over town.  The streets
are sprinkled from end to end with shovel-hatted, long-robed, well-fed priests,
and the church bells by dozens are pealing all the day long, nearly.  Every now
and then one comes across a friar of orders gray, with shaven head, long,
coarse robe, rope girdle and beads, and with feet cased in sandals or entirely
bare.  These worthies suffer in the flesh and do penance all their lives, I
suppose, but they look like consummate famine-breeders.  They are all fat and
serene.<p>
The old Cathedral of San Lorenzo is about as notable a building as we have
found in Genoa.  It is vast, and has colonnades of noble pillars, and a great
organ, and the customary pomp of gilded moldings, pictures, frescoed ceilings,
and so forth.  I cannot describe it, of course--it would require
a<hr><i>page 165</i><br> good many
pages to do that.  But it is a curious place.  They said that half of it--from
the front door halfway down to the altar--was a Jewish synagogue before the
Saviour was born, and that no alteration had been made in it since that time.
We doubted the statement, but did it reluctantly.  We would much rather have
believed it.  The place looked in too perfect repair to be so ancient.<p>
The main point of interest about the cathedral is the little Chapel of St. John
the Baptist.  They only allow women to enter it on one day in the year, on
account of the animosity they still cherish against the sex because of the
murder of the saint to gratify a caprice of Herodias.  In this chapel is a
marble chest, in which, they told us, were the ashes of St. John; and around it
was wound a chain, which, they said, had confined him when he was in prison.
We did not desire to disbelieve these statements, and yet we could not feel
certain that they were correct--partly because we could have broken that chain,
and so could St. John, and partly because we had seen St. John's ashes before,
in another church.  We could not bring ourselves to think St. John had two sets
of ashes.<p>
They also showed us a portrait of the Madonna which was painted by St. Luke,
and it did not look half as old and smoky as some of the pictures by Rubens.
We could not help admiring the Apostle's modesty in never once mentioning in
his writings that he could paint.<p>
But isn't this relic matter a little overdone?  We find a piece of the true
cross in every old church we go into, and some of the nails that held it
together.  I would not like to be positive, but I think we have seen as much as
a keg of these nails.  Then there is the crown of thorns; they have part of one
in Sainte Chapelle, in Paris, and part of one also in Notre Dame.  And as for
bones of St. Denis, I feel certain we have seen enough of them to duplicate him
if necessary.<p>
I only meant to write about the churches, but I keep wandering from the
subject.  I could say that the Church of the Annunciation is a wilderness of
beautiful columns, of statues,
<hr><i>page 166</i><br>gilded moldings, and pictures almost countless,
but that would give no one an entirely perfect idea of the thing, and so where
is the use?  One family built the whole edifice and have got money left.  There
is where the mystery lies.  We had an idea at first that only a mint could have
survived the expense.<p>
These people here live in the heaviest, highest, broadest, darkest, solidest
houses one can imagine.  Each one might "laugh a siege to scorn." A hundred
feet front and a hundred high is about the style, and you go up three flights
of stairs before you begin to come upon signs of occupancy.  Everything is
stone, and stone of the heaviest--floors, stairways, mantels,
benches--everything.  The walls are four to five feet thick.  The streets
generally are four or five to eight feet wide and as crooked as a corkscrew.
You go along one of these gloomy cracks, and look up and behold the sky like a
mere ribbon of light, far above your head, where the tops of the tall houses on
either side of the street bend almost together.  You feel as if you were at the
bottom of some tremendous abyss, with all the world far above you.  You wind in
and out and here and there, in the most mysterious way, and have no more idea
of the points of the compass than if you were a blind man.  You can never
persuade yourself that these are actually streets, and the frowning, dingy,
monstrous houses dwellings, till you see one of these beautiful, prettily
dressed women emerge from them--see her emerge from a dark, dreary-looking den
that looks dungeon all over, from the ground away halfway up t6 heaven.  And
then you wonder that such a charming moth could come from such a forbidding
shell as that.  The streets are wisely made narrow and the houses heavy and
thick and stony, in order that the people may be cool in this roasting climate.
And they are cool, and stay so.  And while I think of it--the men wear hats and
have very dark complexions, but the women wear no headgear but a flimsy veil
like a gossamer's web, and yet are exceedingly fair as a general thing.
Singular, isn't it?<p>
The huge palaces of Genoa are each supposed to be occupied <hr><i>page
167</i><br>
by one family, but
they could accommodate a hundred, I should think.  They are relics of the
grandeur of Genoa's palmy days--the days when she was a great commercial and
maritime power several centuries ago.  These houses, solid marble palaces
though they be, are in many cases of a dull pinkish color, outside, and from
pavement to eaves are pictured with Genoese battle scenes, with monstrous
Jupiters and Cupids, and with familiar illustrations from Grecian mythology.
Where the paint has yielded to age and exposure and is peeling off in flakes
and patches, the effect is not happy.  A noseless Cupid or a Jupiter with an
eye out or a Venus with a fly blister on her breast are not attractive features
in a picture.  Some of these painted walls reminded me somewhat of the tall
van, plastered with fanciful bills and posters, that follows the bandwagon of a
circus about a country village.  I have not read or heard that the outsides of
the houses of any other European city are frescoed in this way.<p>
I cannot conceive of such a thing as Genoa in ruins.  Such massive arches, such
ponderous substructions as support these towering broad-winged edifices, we
have seldom seen before; and surely the great blocks of stone of which these
edifices are built can never decay; walls that are as thick as an ordinary
American doorway is high cannot crumble.<p>
The republics of Genoa and Pisa were very powerful in the Middle Ages.  Their
ships filled the Mediterranean, and they carried on an extensive commerce with
Constantinople and Syria.  Their warehouses were the great distributing depots
from whence the costly merchandise of the East was sent abroad over Europe.
They were warlike little nations and defied, in those days, governments that
overshadow them now as mountains overshadow molehills.  The Saracens captured
and pillaged Genoa nine hundred years ago, but during the following century
Genoa and Pisa entered into an offensive and defensive alliance and besieged
the Saracen colonies in Sardinia and the Balearic Isles with an obstinacy that
maintained its pristine vigor and held to its purpose for forty long years.
They were victorious at last and divided their conquests
<hr><i>page 168</i><br> equably among their
great patrician families.<p>
Descendants of some of those proud families still inhabit the palaces of Genoa,
and trace in their own features a resemblance to the grim knights whose
portraits hang in their stately halls, and to pictured beauties with pouting
lips and merry eyes whose originals have been dust and ashes for many a dead
and forgotten century.<p>
The hotel we live in belonged to one of those great orders of knights of the
Cross in the times of the Crusades, and its mailed sentinels once kept watch
and ward in its massive turrets and woke the echoes of these halls and
corridors with their iron heels.<p>
But Genoa's greatness has degenerated into an unostentatious commerce in
velvets and silver filagreework.  They say that each European town has its
specialty.  These filagree things are Genoa's specialty.  Her smiths take
silver ingots and work them up into all manner of graceful and beautiful forms.
They make bunches of flowers, from flakes and wires of silver, that counterfeit
the delicate creations the frost weaves upon a windowpane; and we were shown a
miniature silver temple whose fluted columns, whose Corinthian capitals and
rich entablatures, whose spire, statues, bells, and ornate lavishness of
sculpture were wrought in polished silver, and with such matchless art that
every detail was a fascinating study and the finished edifice a wonder of
beauty.<p>
<hr><i>page 169</i><br>
We are ready to move again, though we are not really tired yet of the narrow
passages of this old marble cave.  Cave is a good word--when speaking of Genoa
under the stars.  When we have been prowling at midnight through the gloomy
crevices they call streets, where no footfalls but ours were echoing, where
only ourselves were abroad, and lights appeared only at long intervals and at a
distance, and mysteriously disappeared again, and the houses at our elbows
seemed to stretch upward farther than ever toward the heavens, the memory of a
cave I used to know at home was always in my mind, with its lofty passages, its
silence and solitude, its shrouding gloom, its sepulchral echoes, its flitting
lights, and more than all, its sudden revelations of branching crevices and
corridors where we least expected them.<p>
We are not tired of the endless processions of cheerful, chattering gossipers
that throng these courts and streets all day long, either; nor of the
coarse-robed monks; nor of the "Asti" wines, which that old doctor (whom we
call the Oracle), with customary felicity in the matter of getting everything
wrong, misterms "nasty." But we must go, nevertheless.<p>
Our last sight was the cemetery (a burial place intended to accommodate 60,000
bodies), and we shall continue to remember it after we shall have forgotten the
palaces.  It is a vast marble colonnaded corridor extending around a great
unoccupied square of ground; its broad floor is marble, and on every slab is an
inscription--for every slab covers a corpse.  On either side, as one walks down
the middle of the passage, are monuments, tombs, and sculptured figures that
are exquisitely wrought and are full of grace and beauty.  They are new and
snowy; every outline is perfect, every feature guiltless of mutilation, flaw, or
blemish; and therefore, to us these far-reaching ranks of bewitching forms are
a hundredfold more lovely than the damaged and dingy statuary they have saved
from the wreck of ancient art and set up in the galleries of Paris for the
worship of the world.<p>
Well provided with cigars and other necessaries of life, we are now ready to
take the cars for Milan.
