<center><h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER LVI.</h3></center>

<p>
WE visited all the holy places about Jerusalem which we had left unvisited when we journeyed
to the Jordan and then, about three o'clock one afternoon, we fell into procession and marched
out at the stately Damascus gate, and the walls of Jerusalem shut us out forever. We paused on
the summit of a distant hill and took a final look and made a final farewell to the venerable city
which had been such a good home to us.

</p><p> For about four hours we traveled down hill constantly. We followed a narrow
bridle-path which traversed the beds of the mountain gorges, and when we could we got out of
the way of the long trains of laden camels and asses, and when we could not we suffered the
misery of being mashed up against perpendicular walls of rock and having our legs bruised by
the passing freight. Jack was caught two or three times, and Dan and Moult as often. One horse
had a heavy fall on the slippery rocks, and the others had narrow escapes. However, this was
as good a road as we had found in Palestine, and possibly even the best, and so there was not
much grumbling.

</p><p> Sometimes, in the glens, we came upon luxuriant orchards of figs, apricots,
pomegranates, and such things, but oftener the scenery was rugged, mountainous, verdureless
and forbidding. Here and there, towers were perched high up on acclivities which seemed almost
inaccessible. This fashion is as old as Palestine itself and was adopted in ancient times for
security against enemies.

</p><p> We crossed the brook which furnished David the stone that
</p><hr /><i>Page 605</i><br /><p>
killed Goliah, and no
doubt we looked upon the very ground whereon that noted battle was fought. We passed by a
picturesque old gothic ruin whose stone pavements had rung to the armed heels of many a
valorous Crusader, and we rode through a piece of country which we were told once knew
Samson as a citizen.

</p><p> We staid all night with the good monks at the convent of Ramleh, and in the
morning got up and galloped the horses a good part of the distance from there to Jaffa, or Joppa,
for the plain was as level as a floor and free from stones, and besides this was our last march
in Holy Land. These two or three hours finished, we and the tired horses could have rest and
sleep as long as we wanted it. This was the plain of which Joshua spoke when he said, "Sun,
stand thou still on Gibeon, and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon." As we drew near to Jaffa,
the boys spurred up the horses and indulged in the excitement of an actual race -- an experience
we had hardly had since we raced on donkeys in the Azores islands.

</p><p> We came finally to the noble grove of orange-trees in which the Oriental city of
Jaffa lies buried; we passed through the walls, and rode again down narrow streets and among
swarms of animated rags, and saw other sights and had other experiences we had long been
familiar with. We dismounted, for the last time, and out in the offing, riding at anchor, we saw
the ship!  I put an exclamation point there because we felt one when we saw the vessel. The
long pilgrimage was ended, and somehow we seemed to feel glad of it.

</p><p> [For description of Jaffa, see Universal Gazetteer.] Simon the Tanner formerly
lived here. We went to his house. All the pilgrims visit Simon the Tanner's house. Peter saw
the vision of the beasts let down in a sheet when he lay upon the roof of Simon the Tanner's
house. It was from Jaffa that Jonah sailed when he was told to go and prophesy against Nineveh,
and no doubt it was not far from the town that the whale threw him up when he discovered that
he had no ticket.  Jonah was disobedient, and of a fault-finding, complaining disposition, and
deserves to be lightly spoken of, almost. The
</p><hr /><i>Page 606</i><br /><p>
timbers used in the construction of Solomon's
Temple were floated to Jaffa in rafts, and the narrow opening in the reef through which they
passed to the shore is not an inch wider or a shade less dangerous to navigate than it was then.
Such is the sleepy nature of the population Palestine's only good seaport has now and always
had. Jaffa has a history and a stirring one. It will not be discovered any where in this book. If
the reader will call at the circulating library and mention my name, he will be furnished with
books which will afford him the fullest information concerning Jaffa.

</p><p> So ends the pilgrimage. We ought to be glad that we did not make it for the
purpose of feasting our eyes upon fascinating aspects of nature, for we should have been
disappointed -- at least at this season of the year. A writer in "Life in the Holy Land" observes:

</p><p><font size="-1">"Monotonous and uninviting as much of the Holy Land will appear to persons
accustomed to the almost constant verdure of flowers, ample streams and varied surface of our
own country, we must remember that its aspect to the Israelites after the weary march of forty
years through the desert must have been very different."</font>

</p><p>Which all of us will freely grant. But it truly <i>is</i> "monotonous and
uninviting," and there is no <a name="h">sufficient</a> reason for describing it as being otherwise.

</p><p> Of all the lands there are for dismal scenery, I think Palestine must be the
prince. The hills are barren, they are dull of color, they are unpicturesque in shape. The valleys
are unsightly deserts fringed with a feeble vegetation that has an expression about it of being
sorrowful and despondent. The Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee sleep in the midst of a vast
stretch of hill and plain wherein the eye rests upon no pleasant tint, no striking object, no soft
picture dreaming in a purple haze or mottled with the shadows of the clouds. Every outline is
harsh, every feature is distinct, there is no perspective -- distance works no enchantment here.
It is a hopeless, dreary, heart-broken land.

</p><p>Small shreds and patches of it must be very beautiful in the full flush of spring,
however, and all the more beautiful by
</p><hr /><i>Page 607</i><br /><p>
contrast with the far-reaching desolation that surrounds
them on every side. I would like much to see the fringes of the Jordan in spring-time, and
Shechem, Esdraelon, Ajalon and the borders of Galilee -- but even then these spots would seem
mere toy gardens set at wide intervals in the waste of a limitless desolation.

</p><p>Palestine sits in sackcloth and ashes. Over it broods the spell of a curse that has
w ithered its fields and fettered its energies. Where Sodom and Gomorrah reared their domes
and towers, that solemn sea now floods the plain, in whose bitter waters no living thing
exists -- over whose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and dead -- about whose
borders nothing grows but weeds, and scattering tufts of cane, and that treacherous fruit that
promises refreshment to parching lips, but turns to ashes at the touch. Nazareth is forlorn; about
that ford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised Land with songs of rejoicing,
one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic Bedouins of the desert; Jericho the accursed, lies a
moldering ruin, to-day, even as Joshua's miracle left it more than three thousand years ago;
Bethlehem and Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have nothing about them now
to remind one that they once knew the high honor of the Saviour's presence; the hallowed spot
where the shepherds watched their flocks by night, and where the angels sang Peace on earth,
good will to men, is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any feature that is
pleasant to the eye. Renowned Jerusalem itself, the stateliest name in history, has lost all its
ancient grandeur, and is becorme a pauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there
to compel the admiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple which was the pride
and the glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman crescent is lifted above the spot where, on that
most memorable day in the annals of the world, they reared the Holy Cross. The noted Sea of
Galilee, where Roman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the Saviour sailed in their
ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of war and commerce, and its borders are a silent
wilderness; Caper-
</p><hr /><i>Page 608</i><br /><p>
naum is a shapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida
and Chorazin have vanished from the earth, and the "desert places" round about them where
thousands of men once listened to the Saviour's voice and ate the miraculous bread, sIeep in the
hush of a solitude that is inhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.

</p><p>Palestine is desolate and unlovely. And why should it be otherwise? Can the
<i>curse </i>of the Deity beautify a land?

</p><p>Palestine is no more of this work-day world. It is sacred to poetry and
tradition -- it is dream-land.</p>
