<center><h3>The Innocents Abroad--Chapter 9</h3></center>

<p>ABOUT the first adventure we had yesterday afternoon,
after landing here, came near finishing that heedless Blucher.  We had just
mounted some mules and asses and started out under the guardianship of the
stately, the princely, the magnificent Hadji Muhammad Lamarty (may his tribe
increase!) when we came upon a fine Moorish mosque, with tall tower, rich with
checkerwork of many-colored porcelain, and every part and portion of the
edifice adorned with the quaint architecture of the Alhambra, and Blucher
started to ride into the open doorway.  A startling "Hi-hi!" from our camp
followers and a loud "Halt!" from an English gentleman in the party checked the
adventurer, and then we were informed that so dire a profanation is it for a
Christian dog to set foot upon the sacred threshold of a Moorish mosque that no
amount of purification can ever make it fit for the faithful to pray in again.
Had Blucher succeeded in entering the place, he would no doubt have been chased
through the town and stoned; and the time has been, and not many years ago,
either, when a Christian would have been most ruthlessly slaughtered if
captured in a mosque.  We caught a glimpse of the handsome tessellated
pavements within and of the devotees performing their ablutions at the
fountains, but even that we took that glimpse was a thing not relished by the
Moorish bystanders.</p><p>
Some years ago the clock in the tower of the mosque got out of order.  The
Moors of Tangier have so degenerated that it has been long since there was an
artificer among them
</p><hr /><i>page 84</i><br /><p>
capable of curing so delicate a patient as a debilitated
clock.  The great men of the city met in solemn conclave to consider how the
difficulty was to be met.  They discussed the matter thoroughly but arrived at
no solution.  Finally, a patriarch arose and said:</p><p>
"Oh, children of the Prophet, it is known unto you that a Portuguee dog of a
Christian clock mender pollutes the city of Tangier with his presence.  Ye
know, also, that when mosques are builded, asses bear the stones and the
cement, and cross the sacred threshold.  Now, therefore, send the Christian dog
on all fours, and barefoot, into the holy place to mend the clock, and let him
go as an ass!"</p><p>
And in that way it was done.  Therefore, if Blucher ever sees the inside of a
mosque, he will have to cast aside his humanity and go in his natural
character.  We visited the jail and found Moorish prisoners making mats and
baskets. (This thing of utilizing crime savors of civilization.) Murder is
punished with death.  A short time ago three murderers were taken beyond the
city walls and shot.  Moorish guns are not good, and neither are Moorish
marksmen.  In this instance they set up the poor criminals at long range, like
so many targets, and practiced on them--kept them hopping about and dodging
bullets for half an hour before they managed to drive the center.</p><p>
When a man steals cattle, they cut off his right hand and left leg and nail
them up in the marketplace as a warning to everybody.  Their surgery is not
artistic.  They slice around the bone a little, then break off the limb.
Sometimes the patient gets well; but, as a general thing, he don't.  However,
the Moorish heart is stout.  The Moors were always brave.  These criminals
undergo the fearful operation without a wince, without a tremor of any kind,
without a groan! No amount of suffering can bring down the pride of a Moor or
make him shame his dignity with a cry.</p><p>
Here, marriage is contracted by the parents of the parties to it.  There are no
valentines, no stolen interviews, no riding out, no courting in dim parlors, no
lovers' quarrels and reconciliations--
</p><hr /><i>page 85</i><br /><p>
no nothing that is proper to approaching
matrimony.  The young man takes the girl his father selects for him, marries
her, and after that she is unveiled, and he sees her for the first time.  If
after due acquaintance she suits him, he retains her; but if he suspects her
purity, he bundles her back to her father; if he finds her diseased, the same;
or if, after just and reasonable time is allowed her, she neglects to bear
children, back she goes to the home of her childhood.</p><p>
Muhammadans here who can afford it keep a good many wives on hand.  They are
called wives, though I believe the Koran only allows four genuine wives--the
rest are concubines.  The Emperor of Morocco don't know how many wives he has,
but thinks he has five hundred.  However, that is near enough--a dozen or so,
one way or the other, don't matter.</p><p>
Even the Jews in the interior have a plurality of wives.
</p><p>
<a name="b">I </a>
have caught a glimpse of the faces of several Moorish women (for they are
only human, and will expose their faces for the admiration of a Christian dog
when no male Moor is by), and I am full of veneration for the wisdom that leads
them to cover up such atrocious ugliness.</p><p>
They carry their children at their backs, in a sack, like other savages the
world over.</p><p>
Many of the Negroes are held in slavery by the Moors.  But the moment a female
slave becomes her master's concubine her bonds are broken, and as soon as a
male slave can read the first chapter of the Koran (which contains the creed)
he can no longer be held in bondage.</p><p>
They have three Sundays a week in Tangier.  The Muhammadans' comes on Friday,
the Jews' on Saturday, and that of the Christian Consuls on Sunday.  The Jews
are the most radical.  The Moor goes to his mosque about noon on his Sabbath,
as on any other day, removes his shoes at the door, performs his ablutions,
makes his salaams, pressing his forehead to the pavement time and again, says
his prayers, and goes back to his work.</p>
<hr /><i>page 86</i><br /><p>
But the Jew shuts up shop; will not touch copper or bronze money at all; soils
his fingers with nothing meaner than silver and gold; attends the synagogue
devoutly; will not cook or have anything to do with fire; and religiously
refrains from embarking in any enterprise.</p><p>
The Moor who has made a pilgrimage to Mecca is entitled to high distinction.
Men call him Hadji, and he is thenceforward a great personage.  Hundreds of
Moors come to Tangier every year and embark for Mecca.  They go part of the way
in English steamers, and the ten or twelve dollars they pay for passage is
about all the trip costs.  They take with them a quantity of food, and when the
commissary department fails they "skirmish," as Jack terms it in his sinful,
slangy way.  From the time they leave till they get home again, they never
wash, either on land or sea.  They are usually gone from five to seven months,
and as they do not change their clothes during all that time, they are totally
unfit for the drawing room when they get back.</p><p>
Many of them have to rake and scrape a long time to gather together the ten
dollars their steamer passage costs, and when one of them gets back be is a
bankrupt forever after.  Few Moors can ever build up their fortunes again in
one short lifetime after so reckless an outlay.  In order to confine the
dignity of Hadji to gentlemen of patrician blood and possessions, the Emperor
decreed that no man should make the pilgrimage save bloated aristocrats who
were worth a hundred dollars in specie.  But behold how iniquity can circumvent
the law! For a consideration, the Jewish moneychanger lends the pilgrim one
hundred dollars long enough for him to swear himself through, and then receives
it back before the ship sails out of the harbor!</p><p>
Spain is the only nation the Moors fear.  The reason is that Spain sends her
heaviest ships of war and her loudest guns to astonish these Muslims, while
America and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of a gunboat
occasionally.  The Moors, like other savages, learn by what they see, not what
they hear or read.  We have great fleets in the
</p><hr /><i>page 87</i><br /><p>
Mediterranean, but they seldom
touch at African ports.  The Moors have a small opinion of England, France, and
America, and put their representatives to a deal of red-tape circumlocution
before they grant them their common rights, let alone a favor.  But the moment
the Spanish minister makes a demand, it is acceded to at once, whether it be
just or not.</p><p>
Spain chastised the Moors five or six years ago, about a disputed piece of
property opposite Gibraltar, and captured the city of Tetouan.  She
compromised on an augmentation of her territory, twenty million dollars'
indemnity in money, and peace.  And then she gave up the city.  But she never
gave it up until the Spanish soldiers had eaten up all the cats.  They would
not compromise as long as the cats held out.  Spaniards are very fond of cats.
On the contrary, the Moors reverence cats as something sacred.  So the
Spaniards touched them on a tender point that time.  Their unfeline conduct in
eating up all the Tetouan cats aroused a hatred toward them in the
breasts of the Moors, to which even the driving them out of Spain was tame and
passionless.  Moors and Spaniards are foes forever now.  France had a minister
here once who embittered the nation against him in the most innocent way.  He
killed a couple of battalions of cats (Tangier is full of them) and made a
parlor carpet out of their hides.  He made his carpet in circles--first a
circle of old gray tomcats, with their tails all pointing toward the center;
then a circle of yellow cats; next a circle of black cats and a circle of white
ones; then a circle of all sorts of cats; and, finally, a centerpiece of
assorted kittens.  It was very beautiful, but the Moors curse his memory to
this day.</p><p>
When we went to call on our American Consul General today I noticed that all
possible games for parlor amusement seemed to be represented on his center
tables.  I thought that hinted at lonesomeness.  The idea was correct.  His is
the only American family in Tangier.  There are many foreign consuls in this
place, but much visiting is not indulged in.  Tangier is clear out of the
world, and what is the use of
</p><hr /><i>page 88</i><br /><p>
visiting when people have nothing on earth to
talk about?  There is none.  So each consul's family stays at home chiefly and
amuses itself as best it can.  Tangier is full of interest for one day, but
after that it is a weary prison.  The Consul General has been here five years,
and has got enough of it to do him for a century, and is going home shortly.
His family seize upon their letters and papers when the mail arrives, read them
over and over again for two days or three, talk them over and over again for
two or three more till they wear them out, and after that for days together
they eat and drink and sleep, and ride out over the same old road, and see the
same old tiresome things that even decades of centuries have scarcely changed,
and say never a single word!  They have literally nothing whatever to talk
about.  The arrival of an American man-of-war is a godsend to them.  "O
Solitude, where are the charms which sages have seen in thy face?" It is the
completest exile that I can conceive of.  I would seriously recommend to the
government of the United States that when a man commits a crime so heinous
</p><hr /><i>page 89</i><br /><p>
that
the law provides no adequate punishment for it, they make him Consul General to
Tangier.</p><p>
I am glad to have seen Tangier--the second-oldest town in the world.  But I am
ready to bid it good-bye, I believe.</p><p>
We shall go hence to Gibraltar this evening or in the morning, and doubtless
the <i>Quaker City </i>will sail from that port within the next forty-eight
hours.</p>
