<hr><i>page 199</i><br>
We left Milan by rail.  The cathedral six or seven miles
behind us; vast, dreamy, bluish, snow-clad mountains twenty miles in front of
us--these were the accented points in the scenery.  The more immediate scenery
consisted of fields and farmhouses outside the car and a monster-headed dwarf
and a moustached woman inside it.  These latter were not show people.  Alas,
deformity and female beards are too common in Italy to attract attention.<p>
We passed through a range of wild, picturesque hills, steep, wooded,
cone-shaped, with rugged crags projecting here and there, and with dwellings
and ruinous castles perched away up toward the drifting clouds.  We lunched at
the curious old town of Como, at the foot of the lake, and then took the small
steamer and had an afternoon's pleasure excursion to this place--Bellaggio.<p>
When we walked ashore, a party of policemen (people whose cocked hats and showy
uniforms would shame the finest uniform in the military service of the United
States) put us into a little stone cell and locked us in.  We had the whole
passenger list for company, but their room would have been preferable, for
there was no light, there were no windows, no ventilation.  It was close and
hot.  We were much crowded.  It was the Black Hole of Calcutta on a small
scale.  Presently a smoke rose about our feet--a smoke that smelled of all the
dead things of earth, of all the putrefaction and corruption imaginable.<p>
We were there five minutes, and when we got out it was hard to tell which of us
carried the vilest fragrance.<p>

These miserable outcasts called that "fumigating" us, and the term was a tame
one indeed.  They fumigated us to guard themselves against the cholera, though
we hailed from no infected port.  We had left the cholera far behind us all the
time.  However, they must keep epidemics away somehow or other, and fumigation
is cheaper than soap.  They must either wash themselves or fumigate other
people.  Some of the lower classes had rather die than wash, but the fumigation
of strangers causes them no pangs.  They need no fumigation themselves.  Their
habits make it unnecessary.  They carry their preventive with them; they sweat
and fumigate all the day long.  I trust I am a humble and a consistent
Christian.  I try to do what is right.  I know it is my duty to "pray for them
that despitefully use me"; and therefore, hard as it is, I shall still try to
pray for these fumigating, maccaroni-stuffing organ-grinders.<p>

Our hotel sits at the water's edge--at least its front garden does--and we walk
among the shrubbery and smoke at twilight; we look afar off at Switzerland and
the Alps and feel an indolent willingness to look no closer; we go down the
steps and swim in the lake; we take a shapely little boat and sail abroad among
the reflections of the stars, lie on the thwarts and listen to the distant
laughter, the singing, the soft melody of flutes and guitars that comes
floating across the water from pleasuring gondolas; we close the evening with
exasperating billiards on one of those same old execrable tables.  A midnight
luncheon in our ample bedchamber; a final smoke in its contracted veranda
facing the water, the gardens, and the mountains; a summing up of the day's
events.  Then to bed, with drowsy brains harassed with a mad panorama that
mixes up pictures of France, of Italy, of the ship, of the ocean, of home, in
grotesque and bewildering disorder.  Then a melting away of familiar faces, of
cities, and of tossing waves, into a great calm of forgetfulness and peace.<p>
After which, the nightmare.<p>
Breakfast in the morning, and then the lake.<p>
I did not like it yesterday.  I thought Lake Tahoe was <i>much </i>finer.  I
have to confess now, however, that my judgment erred somewhat, though not
extravagantly.  I always had an idea that Como was a vast basin of water, like
Tahoe, shut in by great mountains.  Well, the border of huge mountains is here,
but the lake itself is not a basin.  It is as crooked as any brook, and only
from one-quarter to two-thirds as wide as the Mississippi.  There is not a yard
of low ground on either side of it--nothing but endless chains of mountains
that spring abruptly from the water's edge and tower to altitudes varying from
a thousand to two thousand feet.  Their craggy sides are clothed with
vegetation, and white specks of houses peep out from the luxuriant foliage
everywhere; they are even perched upon jutting and picturesque pinnacles a
thousand feet above your head.<p>
Again, for miles along the shores, handsome country seats, surrounded by
gardens and groves, sit fairly in the water, sometimes <hr><i>page
202</i><br>
in nooks carved by
Nature out of the vine-hung precipices, and with no ingress or egress save by
boats.  Some have great broad stone staircases leading down to the water, with
heavy stone balustrades ornamented with statuary and fancifully adorned with
creeping vines and bright-colored flowers--for all the world like a drop
curtain in a theater--and lacking nothing but long-waisted, high-heeled women
and plumed gallants in silken tights coming down to go serenading in the
splendid gondola in waiting.<p>
A great feature of Como's attractiveness is the multitude of pretty houses and
gardens that cluster upon its shores and on its mountainsides.  They look so
snug and so homelike, and at eventide, when everything seems to slumber and the
music of the vesper bells comes stealing over the water, one almost believes
that nowhere else than on the lake of Como can there be found such a paradise
of tranquil repose.<p>
<hr><i>page 203</i><br>
From my window here in Bellaggio I have a view of the other side of the lake
now, which is as beautiful as a picture.  A scarred and wrinkled precipice
rises to a height of eighteen hundred feet; on a tiny bench halfway up its vast
wall sits a little snowflake of a church, no bigger than a martin box
apparently; skirting the base of the cliff are a hundred orange groves and
gardens, flecked with glimpses of the white dwellings that are buried in them;
in front, three or four gondolas lie idle upon the water--and in the burnished
mirror of the lake, mountain, chapel, houses, groves, and boats are
counterfeited so brightly and so clearly that one scarce knows where the
reality leaves off and the reflection begins!<p>
The surroundings of this picture are fine.  A mile away a grove-plumed
promontory juts far into the lake and glasses its palace in the blue depths; in
midstream a boat is cutting the shining surface and leaving a long track behind
like a ray of light; the mountains beyond are veiled in a dreamy purple haze;
far in the opposite direction a tumbled mass of domes and verdant slopes and
valleys bars the lake, and here indeed does distance lend enchantment to the
view--for on this broad canvas, sun and clouds and the richest of atmospheres
have blended a thousand tints together, and over its surface the filmy lights
and shadows drift, hour after hour, and glorify it with a beauty that seems
reflected out of heaven itself.  Beyond all question, this is the most
voluptuous scene we have yet looked upon.<p>
Last night the scenery was striking and picturesque.  On the other side crags
and trees and snowy houses were reflected in the lake with a wonderful
distinctness, and streams of light from many a distant window shot far abroad
over the still waters.  On this side, near at hand, great mansions, white with
moonlight, glared out from the midst of masses of foliage that lay black and
shapeless in the shadows that fell from the cliff above--and down in the margin
of the lake every feature of the weird vision was faithfully repeated.<p>
Today we have idled through a wonder of a garden attached to a ducal
estate--but enough of description is enough, I judge.

I suspect that this was
the same place the gardener's son deceived the Lady of Lyons with, but I do not
know.  You may have heard of the passage somewhere:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A deep vale, <BR>
Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world,<BR>
Near a clear lake margined by fruits of gold<BR>
And whispering myrtles:<BR>
Glassing softest skies, cloudless,<BR>
Save with rare and roseate shadows;<BR>
A palace, lifting to eternal heaven its marbled walls,<BR>
From out a glossy bower of coolest foliage musical with birds.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
That is all very well, except the "clear" part of the lake.  It certainly is
clearer than a great many lakes, but how dull its waters are compared with the
wonderful transparence of Lake Tahoe! I speak of the north shore of Tahoe,
where one can count the scales on a trout at a depth of a hundred and eighty
feet.  I have tried to get this statement off at par here, but with no success;
so I have been obliged to negotiate it at fifty percent discount.  At this rate
I find some takers; perhaps the reader will receive it on the same
terms--ninety feet instead of one hundred and eighty.  But let it be remembered
that those are forced terms--sheriffs sale prices.  As far as I am privately
concerned, I abate not a jot of the original assertion that in those strangely
magnifying waters one may count the scales on a trout (a trout of the large
kind) at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet--may see every pebble on the
bottom--might even count a paper of dray pins.  People talk of the transparent
waters of the Mexican Bay of Acapulco, but in my own experience I know they
cannot compare with those I am speaking of.  I have fished for trout in Tahoe,
and at a measured depth of eighty-four feet I have seen them put their noses to
the bait and I could see their gills open and shut.  I could hardly have seen
the trout themselves at that distance in the open air.<p>
As I go back in spirit and recall that noble sea, reposing among the snow peaks
six thousand feet above the ocean, the conviction comes strong upon me again
that Como would only seem a bedizened little courtier in that august
presence.<p>
<hr><i>page 205</i><br>
Sorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year to year
permits Tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen!  Tahoe!  It suggests no crystal
waters, no picturesque shores, no sublimity.  Tahoe for a sea in the clouds: a
sea that has character and asserts it in solemn calms at times, at times in
savage storms; a sea whose royal seclusion is guarded by a cordon of sentinel
peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousand feet above the level world; a
sea whose every aspect is impressive, whose belongings are all beautiful, whose
lonely majesty types the Deity!<p>
Tahoe means grasshoppers.  It means grasshopper soup.  It is Indian and
suggestive of Indians.  They say it is Paiute--possibly it is Digger.  I am
satisfied it was named by the Diggers--those degraded savages who roast their
dead relatives, then mix the human grease and ashes of bones with tar and
"gaum" it thick all over their heads and foreheads and ears, and go
caterwauling about the hills and call it <i>mourning.  These</i> are the gentry
that named the lake.<p>
People say that Tahoe means "silver lake"--"limpid water"--"falling leaf."
Bosh.  It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the Digger tribe,--and
of the Paiutes as well.  It isn't worthwhile, in these practical times, for
people to talk about Indian poetry--there never was any in them--except in the
Fenimore Cooper Indians.  But <i>they </i>are an extinct tribe that never
existed.  I know the Noble Red Man.  I have camped with the Indians; I have
been on the warpath with them, taken part in the chase with them--for
grasshoppers; helped them steal cattle; I have roamed with them, scalped them,
had them for breakfast.  I would gladly eat the whole race if I had a chance.<p>
But I am growing unreliable.  I will return to my comparison of the lakes.
Como is a little deeper than Tahoe, if people here tell the truth.  They say it
is eighteen hundred feet deep at this point, but it does not look a dead enough
blue for that.  Tahoe is one thousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep in
the center, by the state geologist's measurement.  They say the great peak
opposite this town is five thousand
<hr><i>page 206</i><br>
feet high, but I feel sure that three
thousand feet of that statement is--a good honest lie.  The lake is a mile wide
here and maintains at&gt;out that width from this point to its northern
extremity--which is distant sixteen miles, from here to its southern
extremity--say fifteen miles--it is not over half a mile wide in any place, I
should think.  Its snow-clad mountains one hears so much about are only seen
occasionally, and then in the distance, the Alps.  Tahoe is from ten to
eighteen miles wide, and its mountains shut it in like a wall.  Their summits
are never free from snow the year round.  One thing about it is very strange:
it never has even a skim of ice upon its surface, although lakes in the same
range of mountains, lying in a lower and warmer temperature, freeze over in
winter.<p>
It is cheerful to meet a shipmate in these out-of-the-way places and compare
notes with him.  We have found one of ours here--an old soldier of the war, who
is seeking bloodless adventures and rest from his campaigns in these sunny
lands.*
