<center><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER XLVI.</center>

<p>ABOUT an hour's ride over a rough, rocky road, half
flooded with water, and through a forest of oaks of Bashan,
brought us to Dan.

</p><p>From a little mound here in the plain issues a broad
stream of limpid water and forms a large shallow pool, and then
rushes furiously onward, augmented in volume. This puddle is an
important source of the Jordan. Its banks, and those of the brook
are respectably adorned with blooming oleanders, but the
unutterable beauty of the spot will not throw a well-balanced man
into convulsions, as the Syrian books of travel would lead one to
suppose.

</p><p>
From the spot I am speaking of, a cannon-ball would carry
beyond the confines of Holy Land and light upon profane ground
three miles away. We were only one little hour's travel within the
borders of Holy Land -- we had hardly begun to appreciate yet that
we were standing upon any different sort of earth than that we had
always been used to, and see how the historic names began already
to cluster! Dan --  Bashan -- Lake Huleh -- the Sources of Jordan -- the Sea of Galilee. They were all in sight but the last, and it was
not far away. The little township of Bashan was once the kingdom
so famous in Scripture for its bulls and its oaks. Lake Huleh is the
Biblical "Waters of Merom." Dan was the northern and Beersheba
the southern limit of Palestine -- hence the expression "from Dan
to Beersheba." It is equivalent to our phrases "from Maine to
Texas" -- "from Baltimore to San Francisco." Our expression and
that of the Israelites both
</p><hr /><i>Page 479</i><br /><p>
mean the same -- great distance. With
their slow camels and asses, it was about a seven days' journey
from Dan to Beersheba -- -say a hundred and fifty or sixty miles -- it was the entire length of their country, and was not to be
undertaken without great preparation and much ceremony. When
the Prodigal traveled to " a far country," it is not likely that he
went more than eighty or ninety miles. Palestine is only from forty
to sixty miles wide. The State of Missouri could be split into three
Palestines, and there would then be enough material left for part
of another -- possibly a whole one. From Baltimore to San
Francisco is several thousand miles, but it will be only a seven
days' journey in the cars when I am two or three years older.* If
I live I shall necessarily have to go across the continent every now
and then in those cars, but one journey from Dan to Beersheba
will be sufficient, no doubt. It must be the most trying of the two.
Therefore, if we chance to discover that from Dan to Beersheba
seemed a mighty stretch of country to the Israelites, let us not be
airy with them, but reflect that it <i>was </i>and
<i>is</i> a mighty stretch when one can not traverse it by rail.

</p><p>
The small mound I have mentioned a while ago was once
occupied by the Phenician city of Laish. A party of filibusters
from Zorah and Eschol captured the place, and lived there</p>

<hr /><i>Page 480</i><br />
<p>in a free and easy way, worshiping gods of their
own manufacture and stealing idols from their neighbors
whenever they wore their own out. Jeroboam set up a golden
calf here to fascinate his people and keep them from making
dangerous trips to Jerusalem to worship, which might result in a
return to their rightful allegiance. With all respect for those
ancient Israelites, I can not overlook the fact that they were not
always virtuous enough to withstand the seductions of a golden
calf. Human nature has not changed much since then.

</p><p>Some forty centuries ago the city of Sodom was
pillaged by the Arab princes of Mesopotamia, and among other
prisoners they seized upon the patriarch Lot and brought him
here on their way to their own possessions. They brought him to
Dan, and father Abraham, who was pursuing them, crept softly
in at dead of night, among the whispering oleanders and under
the shadows of the stately oaks, and fell upon the slumbering
victors and startled them from their dreams with the clash of
steel. He recaptured Lot and all the other plunder.

</p><p>
We moved on. We were now in a green valley, five or six miles
wide and fifteen long. The streams which are called the sources of
the Jordan flow through it to Lake Huleh, a shallow pond three
miles in diameter, and from the southern extremity of the Lake the
concentrated Jordan flows out. The Lake is surrounded by a broad
marsh, grown with reeds. Between the marsh and the mountains
which wall the valley is a respectable strip of fertile land; at the
end of the valley, toward <a name="e">Dan</a>, as much as half the land is solid
and fertile, and watered by Jordan's sources. There is enough of
it to make a farm. It almost warrants the enthusiasm of the spies
of that rabble of adventurers who captured Dan. They said: "We
have seen the land, and behold it is very good. * * * A place
where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth."

</p><p>Their enthusiasm was at least warranted by the fact
that they had never seen a country as good as this. There was

</p><hr /><i>Page 481</i><br /><p>
enough of it for the ample support of their six hundred men and
their families, too.

</p><p>When we got fairly down on the level part of the
Danite farm, we came to places where we could actually run our
horses. It was a notable circumstance.

</p><p>
We had been painfully clambering over interminable hills and
rocks for days together, and when we suddenly came upon this
astonishing piece of rockless plain, every man drove the spurs into
his horse and sped away with a velocity he could surely enjoy to
the utmost, but could never hope to comprehend in Syria.

</p><p>
Here were evidences of cultivation -- a rare sight in this country
-- an acre or two of rich soil studded with last season's dead
corn-stalks of the thickness of your thumb and very wide apart.
But in such a land it was a thrilling spectacle. Close to it was a
stream, and on its banks a great herd of curious-looking Syrian
goats and sheep were gratefully eating gravel. I do not state this
as a petrified fact -- I only <i>suppose </i>they were eating
gravel, because there did not appear to be any thing else for them
to eat. The shepherds that tended them were the very pictures of
Joseph and his brethren I have no doubt in the world. They were
tall, muscular, and very dark-skinned Bedouins, with inky black
beards. They had firm lips, unquailing eyes, and a kingly
stateliness of bearing. They wore the parti-colored half bonnet,
half hood, with fringed ends falling upon their shoulders, and the
full, flowing robe barred with broad black stripes -- the dress one
sees in all pictures of the swarthy sons of the desert. These chaps
would sell their younger brothers if they had a chance, I think.
They have the manners, the customs, the dress, the occupation and
the loose principles of the ancient stock. [They attacked our camp
last night, and I bear them no good will.] They had with them the
pigmy jackasses one sees all over Syria and remembers in all
pictures of the " Flight into Egypt," where Mary and the Young
Child are riding and Joseph is walking alongside, towering high
above the little donkey's shoulders.

</p><p>But really, here the man rides and carries the child,
as a
</p><hr /><i>Page 482</i><br /><p>
general thing, and the woman walks. The customs have not
changed since Joseph's time. We would not have in our houses a
picture representing Joseph riding and Mary walking; we would
see profanation in it, but a Syrian Christian would not. I know that
hereafter the picture I first spoke of will look odd to me.

</p><p>We could not stop to rest two or three hours out
from our camp, of course, albeit the brook was beside us. So we
went on an hour longer. We saw water, then, but nowhere in all
the waste around was there a foot of shade, and we were scorching
to death.  "Like unto the shadow of a great rock in a weary land."
Nothing in the Bible is more beautiful than that, and surely there
is no place we have wandered to that is able to give it such
touching expression as this blistering, naked, treeless land.


</p><p>
Here you do not stop just when you please, but when you can. We
found water, but no shade. We traveled on and found a tree at
last, but no water. We rested and lunched, and came on to this
place, Ain Mellahah (the boys call it Baldwinsville.) It was a very
short day's run, but the dragoman does not want to go further, and
has invented a plausible lie about the country beyond this being
infested by ferocious Arabs, who would make sleeping in their
midst a dangerous pastime. Well, they ought to be dangerous.
They carry a rusty old weather-beaten flint-lock gun, with a barrel
that is longer than themselves; it has no sights on it, it will not
carry farther than a brickbat, and is not half so certain. And the
great sash they wear in many a fold around their waists has two or
three absurd old horse-pistols in it that are rusty
</p><hr /><i>Page 483</i><br /><p>
from eternal
disuse -- weapons that would hang fire just about long enough for
you to walk out of range, and then burst and blow the Arab's head
off. Exceedingly dangerous these sons of the desert are.

</p><p> It used to make my blood run cold to read Wm. C.
Grimes' hairbreadth escapes from Bedouins, but I think I could
read them now without a tremor. He never said he was attacked by
Bedouins, I believe, or was ever treated uncivilly, but then in
about every other chapter he discovered them approaching, any
how, and he had a blood-curdling fashion of working up the peril;
and of wondering how his relations far away would feel could they
see their poor wandering boy, with his weary feet and his dim
eyes, in such fearful danger; and of thinking for the last time of
the old homestead, and the dear old church, and the cow, and
those things; and of finally straightening his form to its utmost
height in the saddle, drawing his trusty revolver, and then dashing
the spurs into "Mohammed" and sweeping down upon the
ferocious enemy determined to sell his life as dearly as possible.
True the Bedouins never did any thing to him when he arrived,
and never had any intention of doing any thing to him in the first
place, and wondered
</p><hr /><i>Page 484</i><br /><p>
what in the mischief he was making all that
to-do about; but still I could not divest myself of the idea,
somehow, that a frightful peril had been escaped through that
man's dare-devil bravery, and so I never could read about Wm. C.
Grimes' Bedouins and sleep comfortably afterward. But I believe
the Bedouins to be a fraud, now. I have seen the monster, and I
can outrun him. I shall never be afraid of his daring to stand
behind his own gun and discharge it.

</p><p>About fifteen hundred years before Christ, this
camp-ground of ours by the Waters of Merom was the scene of
one of Joshua's exterminating battles. Jabin, King of Hazor, (up
yonder above Dan,) called all the sheiks about him together, with
their hosts, to make ready for Israel's terrible General who was
approaching.

</p><p><font size="-1">"And when all these Kings were met together, they
came and pitched together by the Waters of Merom, to fight
    against Israel.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">"And they went out, they and all their hosts with
them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore for
multitude," etc.</font>

</p><p>
But Joshua fell upon them and utterly destroyed them, root and
branch. That was his usual policy in war. He never left any chance
for newspaper controversies about who won the battle. He made
this valley, so quiet now, a reeking slaughter-pen.

</p><p>Somewhere in this part of the country -- I do not
know exactly where -- Israel fought another bloody battle a
hundred years later. Deborah, the prophetess, told Barak to take
ten thousand men and sally forth against another King Jabin who
had been doing something. Barak came down from Mount Tabor,
twenty or twenty-five miles from here, and gave battle to Jabin's
forces, who were in command of Sisera. Barak won the fight, and
while he was making the victory complete by the usual method of
exterminating the remnant of the defeated host, Sisera fled away
on foot, and when he was nearly exhausted by fatigue and thirst,
one Jael, a woman he seems to have been acquainted with, invited
him to come into her tent and rest himself. The weary soldier
acceded readily enough,
</p><hr /><i>Page 485</i><br /><p>
and Jael put him to bed. He said he was
very thirsty, and asked his generous preserver to get him a cup of
water. She brought him some milk, and he drank of it gratefully
and lay down again, to forget in pleasant dreams his lost battle and
his humbled pride. Presently when he was asleep she came softly
in with a hammer and drove a hideous tent-pen down through his
brain!

</p><p>"For he was fast asleep and weary. So he died."
Such is the touching language of the Bible. "The Song of Deborah
and Barak" praises Jael for the memorable service she had
rendered, in an exultant strain:

</p><p><font size="-1">
"Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">
"He asked for water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
butter in a lordly dish.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">
"She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
workman's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she
smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his
temples.</font>

</p><p><font size="-1">
"At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead."</font>

</p><p>
Stirring scenes like these occur in this valley no more. There is
not a solitary village throughout its whole extent -- not for thirty
miles in either direction. There are two or three small clusters of
Bedouin tents, but not a single permanent habitation. One may ride
ten miles, hereabouts, and not see ten human beings.

</p><p>To this region one of the prophecies is applied:

</p><p><font size="-1">I will bring the land into desolation; and your
enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. And I will
scatter you among the heathen, and I will draw out a sword after
you; and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste."</font>

</p><p>No man can stand here by deserted Ain Mellahah
and say the prophecy has not been fulfilled.

</p><p>In a verse from the Bible which I have quoted
above, occurs the phrase �all these kings." It attracted my attention
in a moment, because it carries to my mind such a vastly different
</p><hr /><i>Page 486</i><br /><p>
significance from what it always did at home. I can see easily
enough that if I wish to profit by this tour and come to a correct
understanding of the matters of interest connected with it, I must
studiously and faithfully unlearn a great many things I have
somehow absorbed concerning Palestine. I must begin a system of
reduction. Like my grapes which the spies bore out of the
Promised Land, I have got every thing in Palestine on too large a
scale. Some of my ideas were wild enough. The word Palestine
always brought to my mind a vague suggestion of a country as
large as the United States. I do not know why, but such was the
case. I suppose it was because I could not conceive of a small
country having so large a history. I think I was a little surprised
to find that the grand Sultan of Turkey was a man of only ordinary
size. I must try to reduce my ideas of Palestine to a more
reasonable shape. One gets large impressions in boyhood,
sometimes, which he has to fight against all his life. "All these
kings." When I used to read that in Sunday School, it suggested to
me the several kings of such countries as England, France, Spain,
Germany, Russia, etc., arrayed in splendid robes ablaze with
jewels, marching in grave procession, with sceptres of gold in
their hands and flashing crowns upon their heads. But here in Ain
Mellahah, after coming through Syria, and after giving serious
study to the character and customs of the country, the phrase "all
these kings" loses its grandeur. It suggests only a parcel of petty
chiefs -- ill-clad and ill-conditioned savages much like our Indians,
who lived in full sight of each other and whose "kingdoms" were
large when they were five miles square and contained two
thousand souls. The combined monarchies of the thirty "kings"
destroyed by Joshua on one of his famous campaigns, only covered
an area about equal to four of our counties of ordinary size. The
poor old sheik we saw at Cesarea Philippi with his ragged band of
a hundred followers, would have been called a "king " in those
ancient times.</p>
<p>
It is seven in the morning, and as we are in the country, the
grass ought to be sparkling with dew, the flowers enrich-
</p><hr /><i>Page 487</i><br /><p>
ing the air
with their fragrance, and the birds singing in the trees. But alas,
there is no dew here, nor flowers, nor birds, nor trees. There is
a plain and an unshaded lake, and beyond them some barren
mountains. The tents are tumbling, the Arabs are quarreling like
dogs and cats, as usual, the campground is strewn with packages
and bundles, the labor of packing them upon the backs of the
mules is progressing with great activity, the horses are saddled, the
umbrellas are out, and in ten minutes we shall mount and the long
procession will move again. The white city of the Mellahah,
resurrected for a moment out of the dead centuries, will have
disappeared again and left no sign. </p>
