<center><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER XLVII.</center>

<p>WE traversed some miles of desolate country whose
soil is rich enough, but is given over wholly to weeds -- a silent,
mournful expanse, wherein we saw only three persons  -- Arabs,
with nothing on but a long coarse shirt like the "tow-linen" shirts
which used to form the only summer garment of little negro boys
on Southern plantations. Shepherds they were, and they charmed
their flocks with the traditional shepherd's pipe -- a reed
instrument that made music as exquisitely infernal as these same
Arabs create when they sing.

</p><p>    In their pipes lingered no echo of the wonderful
music the shepherd forefathers heard in the Plains of Bethlehem
what time the angels sang "Peace on earth, good will to men."

</p><p>Part of the ground we came over was not ground at
all, but rocks -- cream-colored rocks, worn smooth, as if by water;
with seldom an edge or a corner on them, but scooped out,
honey-combed, bored out with eye-holes, and thus wrought into all
manner of quaint shapes, among which the uncouth imitation of
skulls was frequent. Over this part of the route were occasional
remains of an old Roman road like the Appian Way, whose
paving-stones still clung to their places with Roman tenacity.

</p><p>Gray lizards, those heirs of ruin, of sepulchres and
desolation, glided in and out among the rocks or lay still and
sunned themselves. Where prosperity has reigned, and fallen;
where glory has flamed, and gone out; where beauty has dwelt,
and passed away; where gladness was, and sorrow is; where the
pomp of life has been, and silence and death brood in its high
</p><hr /><i>Page 489</i><br /><p>
places, there this reptile makes his home, and mocks at human
vanity. His coat is the color of ashes: and ashes are the symbol of
hopes that have perished, of aspirations that came to nought, of
loves that are buried. If he could speak, he would say, Build
temples: I will lord it in their ruins; build palaces: I will inhabit
them; erect empires: I will inherit them; bury your beautiful: I will
watch the worms at their work; and you, who stand here and
moralize over me: I will crawl over <i>your</i> corpse at the
last.

</p><p>A few ants were in this desert place, but merely to
spend the summer. They brought their provisions from Ain
Mellahah -- eleven miles.

</p><p>Jack is not very well to-day, it is easy to see; but
boy as he is, he is too much of a man to speak of it. He exposed
himself to the sun too much yesterday, but since it came of his
earnest desire to learn, and to make this journey as useful as the
opportunities will allow, no one seeks to discourage him by
fault-finding. We missed him an hour from the camp, and then
found him some distance away, by the edge of a brook,
</p><hr /><i>Page 490</i><br /><p>
and with
no umbrella to protect him from the fierce sun. If he had been
used to going without his umbrella, it would have been well
enough, of course; but he was not. He was just in the act of
throwing a clod at a mud-turtle which was sunning itself on a
small log in the brook. We said:

</p><p>"Don't do that, Jack. What do you want to harm
him for? What has he done?"

</p><p>"Well, then, I won't kill him, but I ought to,
because he is a fraud."

</p><p>We asked him why, but he said it was no matter.
We asked him why, once or twice, as we walked back to the camp
but he still said it was no matter. But late at night, when he was
sitting in a thoughtful mood on the bed, we asked him again and
he said:

</p><p>"Well, it don't matter; I don't mind it now, but I
did not like it to-day, you know, because <i>I </i>don't tell
any thing that isn't so, and I don't think the Colonel ought to,
either. But he did; he told us at prayers in the Pilgrims' tent, last
night, and he seemed as if he was reading it out of the Bible, too,
about this country flowing with milk and honey, and about the
voice of the turtle being heard in the land. I thought that was
drawing it a little strong, about the turtles, any how, but I asked
Mr. Church if it was so, and he said it was, and what Mr. Church
tells me, I believe. But I sat there and watched that turtle nearly
an hour to-day, and I almost burned up in the sun; but I never
heard him sing. I believe I sweated a double handful of sweat- --
I <i>know </i>I did -- because it got in my eyes, and it was
running down over my nose all the time; and
</p><hr /><i>Page 491</i><br /><p>
you know my pants
are tighter than any body else's -- Paris foolishness -- and the
buckskin seat of them got wet with sweat, and then got dry again
and began to draw up and pinch and tear loose -- it was awful --
but I never heard him sing. Finally I said, This is a fraud -- that
is what it is, it is a fraud -- and if I had had any sense I might
have known a cursed mud-turtle couldn't sing. And then I said, I
don't wish to be hard on this fellow, and I will just give him ten
minutes to commence; ten minutes -- and then if he don't, down
goes his building. But he <i>didn't </i>commence, you know.
I had staid there all that time, thinking may be he might, pretty
soon, because he kept on raising his head up and letting it down,
and drawing the skin over his eyes for a minute and then opening
them out again, as if he was trying to study up something to sing,
but just as the ten minutes were up and I was all beat out and
blistered, he laid his blamed head down on a knot and went fast
asleep."

</p><p>"It <i>was </i>a little hard, after you had
waited so long."

</p><p>"I should think so. I said, Well, if you won't sing,
</p><hr /><i>Page 492</i><br /><p>
you shan't sleep, any way; and if you fellows had let me alone I
would have made him shin out of Galilee quicker than any  turtle
ever did yet. But it isn't any matter now -- let it go. The  skin is
all off the back of my neck."

</p><p>About ten in the morning we halted at Joseph's Pit.
This is a  ruined Khan of the Middle Ages, in one of whose side
courts is  a great walled and arched pit with water in it, and this
pit, one  tradition says, is the one Joseph's brethren cast him into.
A  more authentic tradition, aided by the geography of the
country,  places the pit in Dothan, some two days' journey from
here.  However, since there are many who believe in this present
pit  as the true one, it has its interest.

</p><p>It is hard to make a choice of the most beautiful
passage in a book which is so gemmed with beautiful passages as
the Bible; but it is certain that not many things within its lids may
take rank above the exquisite story of Joseph. Who taught those
ancient writers their simplicity of language, their felicity of
expression, their pathos, and above all, their faculty of sinking
themselves entirely out of sight of the reader and making the
narrative stand out alone and seem to tell itself? Shakspeare is
always present when one reads his book; Macaulay is present
when we follow the march of his stately sentences; but the Old
Testament writers are hidden from view.

</p><p>If the pit I have been speaking of is the right one,
a scene transpired there, long ages ago, which is familiar to us all
in pictures. The sons of Jacob had been pasturing their flocks near
there. Their father grew uneasy at their long absence, and sent
Joseph, his favorite, to see if any thing had gone wrong with them.
He traveled six or seven days' journey; he was only seventeen
years old, and, boy like, he toiled through that long stretch of the
vilest, rockiest, dustiest country in Asia, arrayed in the pride of his
heart, his beautiful clawhammer coat of many colors. Joseph was
the favorite, and that was one crime in the  eyes of his brethren;
he had dreamed dreams, and interpreted them to foreshadow his
elevation far above all his family in the far future, and that was
another; he was dressed well and had doubtless displayed the
</p><hr /><i>Page 493</i><br /><p>
harmless vanity of youth in keeping the fact prominently before his
brothers. These were crimes his elders fretted over among
themselves and proposed to punish when the opportunity should
offer. When they saw him coming up from the Sea of Galilee, they
recognized him and were glad. They said, "Lo, here is this
dreamer -- let us kill him." But Reuben pleaded for his life, and
they spared it. But they seized the boy, and stripped the hated coat
from his back and pushed him into the pit. <i>They
</i>intended to let him die there, but Reuben intended to liberate
him secretly. However, while Reuben was away for a little while,
the brethren sold Joseph to some Ishmaelitish merchants who were
journeying towards Egypt. Such is the history of the pit. And the
self-same pit is there in that place, even to this day; and there it
will  remain until the next detachment of image-breakers and tomb
desecraters arrives from the <i>Quaker City </i>excursion,
and they will infallibly dig it up and carry it away with  them. For
behold in them is no reverence for the solemn monuments of the
past, and whithersoever they go they destroy and spare not.

</p><p>Joseph became rich, distinguished, powerful -- as
the Bible expresses it, "lord over all the land of Egypt." Joseph
was the real king, the strength, the brain of the monarchy, though
Pharaoh held the title. Joseph is one of the truly great men of the
Old Testament. And he was the noblest and the manliest, save
Esau. Why shall we not say a good  word for the princely
Bedouin? The only crime that can be brought against him is that
he was unfortunate. Why must every body praise Joseph's
great-hearted generosity to his cruel brethren, without stint of
fervent language, and fling only a reluctant bone of praise to Esau
for his still sublimer generosity to the brother who had wronged
him? Jacob took advantage of Esau's consuming hunger to rob him
of his birthright and the great honor and consideration that
belonged to the position; by treachery and falsehood he robbed him
of his father's blessing; he made of him a stranger in his home,
and a wanderer. Yet after twenty years had passed away and Jacob
met Esau
</p><hr /><i>Page 494</i><br /><p>
and fell at his feet quaking with fear and begging
piteously to be spared the punishment he knew he deserved, what
did that magnificent savage do? He fell upon his neck and
embraced him! When Jacob -- who was incapable of
comprehending nobility of character -- still doubting, still fearing,
insisted upon "finding grace with my lord" by the bribe of a
present of cattle, what did the gorgeous son of the desert say?

</p><p>"Nay, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou
hast unto thyself!"

</p><p>Esau found Jacob rich, beloved by wives and
children, and traveling in state, with servants, herds of cattle and
trains of camels -- but he himself was still the uncourted outcast
this brother had made him. After thirteen years of romantic
mystery, the brethren who had wronged Joseph, came, strangers
in a strange land, hungry and humble, to buy "a little food"; and
being summoned to a palace, charged with crime, they beheld in
its owner their wronged brother; they were trembling beggars --
he, the lord of a mighty empire ! What Joseph that ever lived
would have thrown away such a chance to "show off?" Who stands
first -- outcast Esau forgiving Jacob in prosperity, or Joseph on a
king's throne forgiving the ragged tremblers whose happy rascality
placed him there?

</p><p>Just before we came to Joseph's Pit, we had
"raised" a hill, and there, a few miles before us, with not a tree or
a shrub to interrupt the view, lay a vision which millions of
worshipers in the far lands of the earth would give half their
possessions to see -- the sacred Sea of Galilee!

</p><p>Therefore we tarried only a short time at the pit.
We rested the horses and ourselves, and felt for a few minutes the
blessed shade of the ancient buildings. We were out of water, but
the two or three scowling Arabs, with their long guns, who were
idling about the place, said they had none and that there was none
in the vicinity. They knew there was a little brackish water in the
pit, but they venerated a place made sacred by their ancestor's
imprisonment too much to be willing to see Christian dogs drink
from it. But Ferguson tied rags and handkerchiefs together till he
made a rope long enough to
</p><hr /><i>Page 495</i><br /><p>
lower a vessel to the bottom, and we
drank and then rode on; and in a short time we dismounted on
those shores which the feet of the Saviour have made holy ground.

</p><p><a name="b">At noon</a> we took a swim in the Sea of Galilee -- a
blessed privilege in this roasting climate -- and then lunched under
a neglected old fig-tree at the fountain they call Ain-et-Tin, a
hundred yards from ruined Capernaum. Every rivulet that gurgles
out of the rocks and sands of this part of the world is dubbed with
the title of "fountain," and people familiar with the Hudson, the
great lakes and the Mississippi fall into transports of admiration
over them, and exhaust their powers of composition in writing
their praises. If all the poetry and nonsense that have been
discharged upon the fountains and the bland scenery of this region
were collected in a book, it would make a most valuable volume
to burn.

</p><p>During luncheon, the pilgrim enthusiasts of our
party, who had been so light-hearted and so happy ever since they
touched holy ground that they did little but mutter incoherent
rhapsodies, could scarcely eat, so anxious were they to "take
shipping" and sail in very person
</p><hr /><i>Page 496</i><br /><p>
upon the waters that had borne
the vessels of the Apostles. Their anxiety grew and their
excitement augmented with every fleeting moment, until my fears
were aroused and I began to have misgivings that in their present
condition they might break recklessly loose from all considerations
of prudence and buy a whole fleet of ships to sail in instead of
hiring a single one for an hour, as quiet folk are wont to do. I
trembled to think of the ruined purses this day's performances
might result in. I could not help reflecting bodingly upon the
intemperate zeal with which middle-aged men are apt to surfeit
themselves upon a seductive folly which they have tasted for the
first time. And yet I did not feel that I had a right to be surprised
at the state of things which was giving me so much concern. These
men had been taught from infancy to revere, almost to worship,
the holy places whereon their happy eyes were resting now. For
many and many a year this very picture had visited their thoughts
by day and floated through their dreams by night. To stand before
it in the flesh -- to see it as they saw it now -- to sail upon the
hallowed sea, and kiss the holy soil that compassed it about: these
were aspirations they had cherished while a generation dragged its
lagging seasons by and left its furrows in their faces and its frosts
upon their hair. To look upon this picture, and sail upon this sea,
they had forsaken home and its idols and journeyed thousands and
thousands of miles, in weariness and tribulation. What wonder that
the sordid lights of work-day prudence should pale before the
glory of a hope like theirs in the full splendor of its fruition? Let
them squander millions! I said -- who speaks of money at a time
like this?

</p><p>In this frame of mind I followed, as fast as I could,
the eager footsteps of the pilgrims, and stood upon the shore of the
lake, and swelled, with hat and voice, the frantic hail they sent
after the "ship" that was speeding by. It was a success. The toilers
of the sea ran in and beached their barque. Joy sat upon every
countenance.

</p><p>"How much? -- ask him how much, Ferguson! --
how much to take us all -- eight of us, and you -- to Bethsaida,
yonder,
</p><hr /><i>Page 497</i><br /><p>
and to the mouth of Jordan, and to the place where the
swine ran down into the sea -- quick! -- and we want to coast
around every where -- every where! -- all day long! -- I could sail
a year in these waters! -- and tell him we'll stop at Magdala and
finish at Tiberias! -- ask him how much? -- any thing -- any thing
whatever! -- tell him we don't care what the expense is!" [I said
to myself, I knew how it would be.]

</p><p><i>Ferguson -- </i>(interpreting) -- "He says
two Napoleons -- eight dollars."

</p><p>One or two countenances fell. Then a pause.

</p><p>"Too much! -- we'll give him one!"

</p><p>I never shall know how it was -- I shudder yet
when I think how the place is given to miracles -- but in a single
instant of time, as it seemed to me, that ship was twenty paces
from the shore, and speeding away like a frightened thing! Eight
crestfallen creatures stood upon the shore, and O, to think of it!
this -- this -- after all that overmastering ecstacy! Oh, shameful,
shameful ending, after such unseemly boasting! It was
</p><hr /><i>Page 498</i><br /><p>
too much
like "Ho! let me at him!" followed by a prudent "Two of you hold
him -- one can hold me!"

</p><p>Instantly there was wailing and gnashing of teeth in
the camp. The two Napoleons were offered -- more if necessary -
- and pilgrims and dragoman shouted themselves hoarse with
pleadings to the retreating boatmen to come back. But they sailed
serenely away and paid no further heed to pilgrims who had
dreamed all their lives of some day skimming over the sacred
waters of Galilee and listening to its hallowed story in the
whisperings of its waves, and had journeyed countless leagues to
do it, and -- and then concluded that the fare was too high.
Impertinent Mohammedan Arabs, to think such things of
gentlemen of another faith!

</p><p>Well, there was nothing to do but just submit and
forego the privilege of voyaging on Genessaret, after coming half
around the globe to taste that pleasure. There was a time, when the
Saviour taught here, that boats were plenty among the fishermen
of the coasts -- but boats and fishermen both are gone, now; and
old Josephus had a fleet of men-of-war in these waters eighteen
centuries ago -- a hundred and thirty bold canoes -- but they, also,
have passed away and left no sign. They battle here no more by
sea, and the commercial marine of Galilee numbers only two small
ships, just of a pattern with the little skiffs the disciples knew. One
was lost to us for good -- the other was miles away and far out of
hail. So we mounted the horses and rode grimly on toward
Magdala, cantering along in the edge of the water for want of the
means of passing over it

</p><p>How the pilgrims abused each other! Each said it
was the other's fault, and each in turn denied it. No word was
spoken by the sinners -- even the mildest sarcasm might have been
dangerous at such a time. Sinners that have been kept down and
had examples held up to them, and suffered frequent lectures, and
been so put upon in a moral way and in the matter of going slow
and being serious and bottling up slang, and so crowded in regard
to the matter of being proper and always and forever behaving,
that their lives have become a burden
</p><hr /><i>Page 499</i><br /><p>
to them, would not lag
behind pilgrims at such a time as this, and wink furtively, and be
joyful, and commit other such crimes -- because it would not occur
to them to do it. Otherwise they would. But they did do it, though
-- and it did them a world of good to hear the pilgrims abuse each
other, too. We took an unworthy satisfaction in seeing them fall
out, now and then, because it showed that they were only poor
human people like us, after all.

</p><p>So we all rode down to Magdala, while the
gnashing of teeth waxed and waned by turns, and harsh words
troubled the holy calm of Galilee.

</p><p>Lest any man think I mean to be ill-natured when
I talk about our pilgrims as I have been talking, I wish to say in
all sincerity that I do not. I would not listen to lectures from men
I did not like and could not respect; and none of these can say I
ever took their lectures unkindly, or was restive under the
infliction, or failed to try to profit by what they said to me. They
are better men than I am; I can say that honestly; they are good
friends of mine, too -- and besides, if they did not wish to be
stirred up occasionally in print, why in the mischief did they travel
with me? They knew me. They knew my liberal way -- that I like
to give and take -- when it is for me to give and other people to
take. When one of them threatened to leave me in Damascus when
I had the cholera, he had no real idea of doing it -- I know his
passionate nature and the good impulses that underlie it. And did
I not overhear Church, another pilgrim, say he did not care who
went or who staid, <i>he </i>would stand by me till I walked
out of Damascus on my own feet or was carried out in a coffin, if
it was a year? And do I not include Church every time I abuse the
pilgrims -- and would I be likely to speak ill-naturedly of him ? I
wish to stir them up and make them healthy; that is all.

</p><p>We had left Capernaum behind us. It was only a
shapeless ruin. lt bore no semblance to a town, and had nothing
about it to suggest that it had ever been a town. But all desolate
and unpeopled as it was, it was illustrious ground. From it
</p><hr /><i>Page 500</i><br /><p>
sprang
that tree of Christianity whose broad arms overshadow so many
distant lands to-day. After Christ was tempted of the devil in the
desert, he came here and began his teachings; and during the three
or four years he lived afterward, this place was his home almost
altogether. He began to heal the sick, and his fame soon spread so
widely that sufferers came from Syria and beyond Jordan, and
even from Jerusalem, several days' journey away, to be cured of
their diseases. Here he healed the centurion's servant and Peter's
mother-in-law, and multitudes of the lame and the blind and
persons possessed of devils; and here, also, he raised Jairus's
daughter from the dead. He went into a ship with his disciples, and
when they roused him from sleep in the midst of a storm, he
quieted the winds and lulled the troubled sea to rest with his voice.
He passed over to the other side, a few miles away and relieved
two men of devils, which passed into some swine. After his return
he called Matthew from the receipt of customs, performed some
cures, and created scandal by eating with publicans and sinners.
Then he went healing and teaching through Galilee, and even
journeyed to Tyre and Sidon. He chose the twelve disciples, and
sent them abroad to preach the new gospel. He worked miracles
in Bethsaida and Chorazin -- villages two or three miles from
Capernaum. It was near one of them that the miraculous draft of
fishes is supposed to have been taken, and it was in the desert
places near the other that he fed the thousands by the miracles of
the loaves and fishes. He cursed them both, and Capernaum also,
for not repenting, after all the great works he had done in their
midst, and prophesied against them. They are all in ruins, now --
which is gratifying to the pilgrims, for, as usual, they fit the
eternal words of gods to the evanescent things of this earth; Christ,
it is more probable, referred to the <i>people, </i>not their
shabby villages of wigwams: he said it would be sad for them at
"the day of judgment" -- and what business have mud-hovels at the
Day of Judgment? It would not affect the prophecy in the least --
it would neither prove it or disprove it -- if these towns were
splendid cities now instead of the almost
</p><hr /><i>Page 501</i><br /><p>
vanished ruins they are.
Christ visited Magdala, which is near by Capernaum, and he also
visited Cesarea Philippi. He went up to his old home at Nazareth,
and saw his brothers Joses, and Judas, and James, and Simon --
those persons who, being own brothers to Jesus Christ, one would
expect to hear mentioned sometimes, yet who ever saw their
names in a newspaper or heard them from a pulpit? Who ever
inquires what manner of youths they were; and whether they slept
with Jesus, played with him and romped about him; quarreled with
him concerning toys and trifles; struck him in anger, not
suspecting what he was? Who ever wonders what they thought
when they saw him come back to Nazareth a celebrity, and looked
long at his unfamiliar face to make sure, and then said, "It
<i>is</i> Jesus?" Who wonders what passed in their minds
when they saw this brother, (who was <i>only </i>a brother
to them, however much he might be to others a mysterious
stranger who was a god and had stood face to face with God above
the clouds,) doing strange miracles with crowds of astonished
people for witnesses? Who wonders if the brothers of Jesus asked
him to come home with them, and said his mother and his sisters
were grieved at his long absence, and would be wild with delight
to see his face again ? Who ever gives a thought to the sisters of
Jesus at all ? -- yet he had sisters; and memories of them must
have stolen into his mind often when he was ill-treated among
strangers; when he was homeless and said he had not where to lay
his head; when all deserted him, even Peter, and he stood alone
among his enemies.

</p><p>Christ did few miracles in Nazareth, and staid but
a little while. The people said, <i>"This</i> the Son of God!
Why, his father is nothing but a carpenter. We know the family.
We see them every day. Are not his brothers named so and so,
and his sisters so and so, and is not his mother the person they call
Mary ? This is absurd." He did not curse his home, but he shook
its dust from his feet and went away.

</p><p>Capernaum lies close to the edge of the little sea,
in a small plain some five miles long and a mile or two wide,
which is mildly adorned with oleanders which look all the better
con-
</p><hr /><i>Page 502</i><br /><p>
trasted with the bald hills and the howling deserts which
surround them, but they are not as deliriously beautiful as the
books paint them. If one be calm and resolute he can look upon
their comeliness and live.

</p><p>One of the most astonishing things that have yet
fallen under our observation is the exceedingly small portion of the
earth from which sprang the now flourishing plant of Christianity.
The longest journey our Saviour ever performed was from here to
Jerusalem -- about one hundred to one hundred and twenty miles.
The next longest was from here to Sidon -- say about sixty or
seventy miles. Instead of being wide apart -- as American
appreciation of distances would naturally suggest -- the places
made most particularly celebrated by the presence of Christ are
nearly all right here in full view, and within cannon-shot of
Capernaum. Leaving out two or three short journeys of the
Saviour, he spent his life, preached his gospel, and performed his
miracles within a compass no larger than an ordinary county in the
United States. It is as much as I can do to comprehend this
stupefying fact. How it wears a man out to have to read up a
hundred pages of history every two or three miles -- for verily the
celebrated localities of Palestine occur that close together. How
wearily, how bewilderingly they swarm about your path!

</p><p>In due time we reached the ancient village of
Magdala.
