<p>IT was worth a kingdom to be at sea again. It was a relief to drop
    all anxiety whatsoever--all questions as to where we should go;
    how long we should stay; whether it were worth while to go or not;
    all anxieties about the condition of the horses; all such
    questions as "Shall we <i>ever</i> get to water?"  "Shall we
<i>ever</i> lunch?" "Ferguson, how many <i>more</i> million miles have we
got to creep under this awful sun before we camp?" It was a relief to
    cast all these torturing little anxieties far away--ropes of steel
    they were, and every one with a separate and distinct strain on
    it--and feel the temporary contentment that is born of the
    banishment of all care and responsibility. We did not look at the
    compass: we did not care, now, where the ship went to, so that she
    went out of sight of land as quickly as possible. When I travel
    again, I wish to go in a pleasure ship. No amount of money could
    have purchased for us, in a strange vessel and among unfamiliar
    faces, the perfect satisfaction and the sense of being <i>at home</i>
    again which we experienced when we stepped on board the "Quaker
    City,"--<i>our own ship</i>--after this wearisome pilgrimage. It is a
    something we have felt always when we returned to her, and a
    something we had no desire to sell.
    
</p><p>We took off our blue woollen shirts, our spurs, and heavy boots,
    our sanguinary revolvers and our buckskin-seated pantaloons, and
    got shaved and came out in Christian costume once more. All but
    Jack, who changed all other articles of his dress, but clung to
    his traveling pantaloons. They still preserved their ample
    buckskin seat intact; and so his short pea jacket and his long,
    thin legs assisted to make him a pictu- 

<hr><i>Page 610</i><br>    
    resque object whenever he stood on the forecastle looking  
    abroad upon the ocean over the bows. At such times his  
    father's last injunction suggested itself to me. He said:
    
   </p><p> "Jack, my boy, you are about to go among a brilliant  
    company of gentlemen and ladies, who are refined and  
    cultivated, and thoroughly accomplished in the manners and  
    customs of good society. Listen to their conversation, study  
    their habits of life, and learn. Be polite and obliging to all, and  
    considerate towards every one's opinions, failings and  
    prejudices. Command the just respect of all your  
    fellow-voyagers, even though you fail to win their friendly  
    regard. And Jack--don't you ever dare, while you live, appear  
    in public on those decks in fair weather, in a costume  
    unbecoming your mother's drawing-room!"
    
   </p><p> It would have been worth any price if the father of this
hopeful youth could have stepped on board some time, and seen him
standing high on the fore-castle, pea jacket, tasseled red fez,
buckskin patch and all, placidly contemplating the ocean--a rare
spectacle for any body's drawing-room.

</p><p> After a pleasant voyage
    and a good rest, we drew near to Egypt and out of the mellowest of
     sunsets we saw the domes and minarets of Alexandria rise into
    view. As soon as the anchor was down, Jack and I got a boat and
    went ashore. It was night by this time, and the other passengers
    were content to remain at home


    

<hr><i>Page 611</i><br>
    and visit ancient Egypt after breakfast. It was the way they  
    did at Constantinople. They took a lively interest in new  
    countries, but their school-boy impatience had worn off, and  
    they had learned that it was wisdom to take things easy and go  
    along comfortably--these old countries do not go away in the  
    night; they stay till after breakfast.
    
</p><p>When we reached the pier we found an army of Egyptian  
    boys with donkeys no larger than themselves, waiting for 
    passengers--for donkeys are the omnibuses of Egypt. We  
    preferred to walk, but we could not have our own way. The  
    boys crowded about us, clamored around us, and slewed their  
    donkeys exactly across our path, no matter which way we  
    turned. They were good-natured rascals, and so were the  
    donkeys. We mounted, and the boys ran behind us and kept  
    the donkeys in a furious gallop, as is the fashion at Damascus.
    I believe I would rather ride a donkey than any beast in the  
    world. He goes briskly, he puts on no airs, he is docile, though  
    
<hr><i>Page 612</i><br>
    opinionated. Satan himself could not scare him, and he is 
    convenient--very convenient. When you are tired riding you 
    can  rest your feet on the ground and let him gallop from under 
    you.
    
</p><p>We found the hotel and secured rooms, and were happy to  
    know that the Prince of Wales had stopped there once. They  
    had it every where on signs. No other princes had stopped 
    there  since, till Jack and I came. We went abroad through the 
    town,  then, and found it a city of huge commercial buildings, 
    and  broad, handsome streets brilliant with gas-light. By night it 
    was  a sort of reminiscence of Paris. But finally Jack found an  
    ice-cream saloon, and that closed investigations for that  
    evening. The weather was very hot, it had been many a day  
    since Jack had seen ice-cream, and so it was useless to talk of  
    leaving the saloon till it shut up.
    
</p><p>In the morning the lost tribes of America came ashore and
    infested the hotels and took possession of all the donkeys and
    other open barouches that offered. They went in picturesque
    procession to the American Consul's; to the great gardens; to
    Cleopatra's Needles; to Pompey's Pillar; to the palace of the
    Viceroy of Egypt; to the Nile; to the superb groves of date-palms.
    One of our most inveterate relic-hunters had his hammer with him, and
tried to break a
    fragment off the upright Needle and could not do it; he tried the
    prostrate one and failed; he borrowed a heavy sledge hammer from a
mason and tried again. He tried Pompey's
    Pillar, and this baffled him. Scattered all about the mighty
    monolith were sphinxes of noble countenance, carved out of
    Egyptian granite as
    
<hr><i>Page 613</i><br>
    hard as blue steel, and whose shapely features the wear of five  
    thousand years had failed to mark or mar. The relic-hunter  
    battered at these persistently, and sweated profusely over his  
    work. He might as well have attempted to deface the moon.  
    They regarded him serenely with the stately smile they had  
    worn so long, and which seemed to say, "Peck away, poor  
    insect; we were not made to fear such as you; in ten-score  
    dragging ages we have seen more of your kind than there are  
    sands at your feet: have they left a blemish upon us?"
    
</p><p>But I am forgetting the Jaffa Colonists. At Jaffa we had  
    taken on board some forty members of a very celebrated  
    community. They were male and female; babies, young boys  
    and young girls; young married people, and some who had  
    passed a shade beyond the prime of life. I refer to the "Adams  
    Jaffa Colony." Others had deserted before. We left in Jaffa  
    Mr. Adams, his wife, and fifteen unfortunates who not only had  
    no money but did not know where to turn or whither to go.  
    Such was the statement made to us. Our forty were miserable  
    enough in the first place, and they lay about the decks seasick  
    all the voyage, which about completed their misery, I take it.  
    However, one or two young men remained upright, and by  
    constant persecution we wormed out of them some little  
    information. They gave it reluctantly and in a very fragmentary  
    condition, for, having been shamefully humbugged by their  
    prophet, they felt humiliated and unhappy. In such  
    circumstances people do not like to talk.
    
</p><p>The colony was a complete <i>fiasco</i>. I have already 
    said that  such as could get away did so, from time to time. The 
    prophet  Adams--once an actor, then several other things, 
    afterward a  Mormon and a missionary, always an 
    adventurer--remains at  Jaffa with his handful of sorrowful 
    subjects. The forty we  brought away with us were chiefly 
    destitute, though not all of  them. They wished to get to Egypt. 
    What might become of  them then they did not know and 
    probably did not care--any  thing to get away from hated 
    Jaffa. They had little to hope for.  Because after many appeals 
    to the sympathies of  
    
<hr><i>Page 614</i><br> 

New England, made by strangers of Boston, through the newspapers, and
    after the establishment of an office there for the reception of
    moneyed contributions for the Jaffa colonists, One Dollar was
    subscribed. The consul-general for Egypt showed me the newspaper
    paragraph which mentioned the circumstance and mentioned also the
    discontinuance of the effort and the closing of the office. It was
    evident that practical New England was not sorry to be rid of such
    visionaries and was not in the least inclined to hire any body to
    bring them back to her. Still, to get to Egypt, was something, in
    the eyes of the unfortunate colonists, hopeless as the prospect
    seemed of ever getting further.
    
</p><p>Thus circumstanced, they landed at Alexandria from our 
    ship. One of our passengers, Mr. Moses S. Beach, of the New 
    York <i>Sun</i>, inquired of the consul-general what it would cost to 
    send these people to their home in Maine by the way of 
    Liverpool, and he said fifteen hundred dollars in gold would do 
    it. Mr. Beach gave his check for the money and so the troubles 
    of the Jaffa colonists were at an end.*
    
</p><p>Alexandria was too much like a European city to be novel, 
    and we soon tired of it. We took the cars and came up here
    
</p><p><font size=-1>* It was an unselfish act of benevolence;
it was done without
any ostentation, and has never been mentioned in any newspaper, I
think. Therefore it is refreshing to learn now, several months after
the above narrative was written, that another man received all the
credit of this rescue of the colonists. Such is life.</font>
  
<hr><i>Page 615</i><br> to ancient Cairo, which <i>is</i> an Oriental city
    and of the completest pattern. There is little about it to
    disabuse one's mind of the error if he should take it into his
    head that he was in the heart of Arabia. Stately camels and
    dromedaries, swarthy Egyptians, and likewise Turks and black
    Ethiopians, turbaned, sashed, and blazing in a rich variety of
Oriental costumes of all shades of flashy colors, are what one sees on
    every hand crowding the narrow streets and the honeycombed
    bazaars. We are stopping at Shepherd's Hotel, which is the worst
    on earth except the one I stopped at once in a small town in the
    United States. It is pleasant to read this sketch in my
    note-book, now, and know that I can stand Shepherd's Hotel, sure,
    because I have been in one just like it in America and survived:
    
</p><p><font size=-1><blockquote> I stopped at the Benton House. It used
to be a good hotel,
but that proves nothing--I used to be a good boy, for that matter.
Both of us have lost character of late years. The Benton is not a good
hotel. The Benton lacks a very great deal of being a good hotel.
Perdition is full of better hotels than the Benton.
    
</p><p> It was late at night when I got there, and I told the clerk I
would like plenty of lights, because I wanted to read an hour or two.
When I reached No. 15 with the porter (we came along a dim hall that
was clad in ancient carpeting, faded, worn out in many places, and
patched with old scraps of oil cloth--a hall that sank under one's feet,
and creaked dismally to every footstep,) he struck a light--two inches
of sallow, sorrowful, consumptive tallow candle, that burned blue, and
sputtered, and got discouraged and went out. The porter lit it again,
and I asked if that was all the light the clerk sent. He said, "Oh
no, I've got another one here," and he produced another couple of
inches of tallow candle.  I said, "Light them both--I'll have to have
one to see the other by." He did it, but the result was drearier than
darkness itself. He was a cheery, accommodating rascal. He said he
would </blockquote></font>

<hr><i>Page 616</i><br>

<blockquote><font size=-1>go "somewheres" and steal a lamp. I abetted and
encouraged him in his  
criminal design. I heard the landlord get after him in the hall ten
minutes afterward.  

</p><p>"Where are you going with that lamp?"

</p><p>"Fifteen wants it, sir."

</p><p>"Fifteen! why he's got a double lot of candles--does the man
    want to illuminate the house?--does he want to get up a
    torch-light procession?--what <i>is</i> he up to, any how?"

</p><p> "He don't like them candles--says he wants a lamp."

</p><p>"Why what in the nation does--why I never heard of such a thing?
What on earth can he want with that lamp?"
    
</p><p> "Well, he only wants to read--that's what he says."
    
</p><p> "Wants to read, does he?--ain't satisfied with a thousand
candles, but has to have a lamp!--I do wonder what the devil that
fellow wants that lamp for?  Take him another candle, and then if--"
    
</p><p>"But he wants the lamp--says he'll burn the d--d old house down
if he don't get a lamp!" (a remark which I never made.)
    
</p><p>"I'd like to see him at it once. Well, you take it along--but I
swear it beats <i>my</i> time, though--and see if you can't find out what
in
the very nation he <i>wants</i> with that lamp."
    
</p><p> And he went off growling to himself and still wondering and
wondering over the unaccountable conduct of No. 15. The lamp was a
good one, but it revealed some disagreeable things--a bed in the
suburbs of a desert of room--a bed that had hills and valleys in it,
and you'd have to accommodate your body to the impression left in it
by the man that slept there last, before you could lie comfortably; a
carpet that had seen better days; a melancholy washstand in a remote
corner, and a dejected pitcher on it sorrowing over a broken nose; a
looking-glass split across the centre, which chopped your head off at
the chin and made you look like some dreadful unfinished monster or
other; the paper peeling in shreds from the walls.
    
</p><p>I sighed and said: "This is charming; and now don't you think
you could get me something to read?"
    
</p><p>The porter said, "Oh, certainly; the old man's got dead loads
of books;" and he was gone before I could tell him what sort of
literature I would rather have. And yet his countenance expressed the
utmost confidence in his ability to execute the commission with credit
to himself. The old man made a descent on him.
    
</p><p>"What are you going to do with that pile of books?"
    
</p><p>"Fifteen wants 'em, sir."
    
</p><p>"Fifteen, is it? He'll want a warming-pan, next--he'll want a
nurse! Take him every thing there is in the house--take him the
bar-keeper--take him the baggage-wagon--take him a chamber-maid!
Confound me, I never saw any thing like it. What did he say he wants
with those books?"
    
</p><p> "Wants to read 'em, like enough; it ain't likely he wants to
eat 'em, I don't reckon."
    

</p><p> "Wants to read 'em--wants to read 'em this time of night, the
infernal lunatic! Well, he can't have them."

</p><p>"But he says he's mor'ly bound to have 'em; he says he'll just
go a-rairin' and a-chargin' through this house and raise more--well,
there's no tellin' what he </font></blockquote>

<hr><i>Page 617</i><br>

<font size=-1><blockquote> won't do if he don't get 'em; because he's
drunk and crazy and desperate, and nothing'll soothe him down but them
cussed books." [I had not made any threats, and was not in the condition
ascribed to me by the porter.] 

</p><p>"Well, go on; but I will be around when he goes to rairing and
charging, and the first rair he makes I'll make him rair out of the
window." And then the old gentleman went off, growling as before.

</p><p>The genius of that porter was something wonderful. He put an armful
of books on the bed and said "Good night" as confidently as if he knew
perfectly well that those books were exactly my style of reading matter.
And well he might. His selection covered the whole range of legitimate
literature. It comprised "The Great Consummation," by Rev. Dr.
Cummings--theology; "Revised Statutes of the State of Missouri"--law; "The
Complete Horse-Doctor"--medicine;  "The Toilers of the Sea," by Victor
Hugo--romance; "The works of William <orig
reg="Shakespeare">Shakspeare"</orig>--poetry. I shall never
cease to admire the tact and the intelligence of that gifted
porter.</blockquote></font>
    
  </p><p>  But all the donkeys in Christendom, and most of the 
    Egyptian  boys, I think, are at the door, and there is some 
    noise going on,  not to put it in stronger language.--We 
    are about starting to the  illustrious Pyramids of Egypt, 
    and the donkeys for the voyage  are under inspection. I 
    will go and select one before the choice  animals are all 
    taken.
