<hr><i>page 153</i><br>
VERSAILLES!  It is wonderfully beautiful! You gaze and
stare and try to understand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it
is not the Garden of Eden--but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world
of beauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite
dream.  The scene thrills one like military music! A noble palace, stretching
its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemed that it would never
end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armies of an empire might parade;
all about it rainbows of flowers, and colossal statues that were almost
numberless and yet seemed only scattered over the ample space; broad flights of
stone steps leading down from the promenade to lower grounds of the
park--stairways that whole regiments might stand to arms upon and have room to
spare; vast fountains whose great bronze effigies discharged rivers of
sparkling water into the air and mingled a hundred curving jets together in
forms of matchless beauty; wide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither and
thither in every direction and wandered to seemingly interminable distances,
walled all the way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose
branches met above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever
were carved in stone; and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes with
miniature ships glassed in their surfaces.  And everywhere--on the palace
steps, and the great promenade, around the fountains, among the trees, and far
under the arches of the endless avenues--hundreds<hr><i>page
154</i><br>
and hundreds of people in gay
costumes walked or ran or danced, and gave to the fairy picture the life and
animation which was all of perfection it could have lacked.<p>
It was worth a pilgrimage to see.  Everything is on so gigantic a scale.
Nothing is small--nothing is cheap.  The statues are all large; the palace is
grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues are interminable.  All
the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles are vast.  I used to
think the pictures exaggerated these distances and these dimensions beyond all
reason, and that they made Versailles more beautiful than it was possible for
any place in the world to be.  I know now that the pictures never came up to
the subject in any respect, and that no painter could represent Versailles on
canvas as beautiful as it is in reality.  I used to abuse Louis XIV for
spending two hundred millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park when
bread was so scarce <hr><i>page 155</i><br>with some of his subjects, but I have forgiven him now.  He
took a tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this
park and build this palace and a road to it from Paris.  He kept 36,000 men
employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they used to die and
be hauled off by cartloads every night.  The wife of a nobleman of the time
speaks of this as an <i>"inconvenience," </i>but na&iuml;vely remarks that "it
does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of tranquillity we now
enjoy."  I always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery
into pyramids and squares and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes, and
when I saw the same thing being practiced in this great park I began to feel
dissatisfied.  But I soon saw the idea of the thing and the wisdom of it.  They
seek the <i>general </i>effect.  We distort a dozen sickly trees into
unaccustomed shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining room, and then
surely they look absurd enough.  But here they take two hundred thousand tall
forest trees and set them in a double row; allow no sign of leaf or branch to
grow on the trunk lower down than six feet above the ground; from that point
the boughs begin to project, and very gradually they extend outward further and
further till they meet overhead, and a faultless tunnel of foliage is formed.
The arch is mathematically precise.  The effect is then very fine.  They make
trees take fifty different shapes, and so these quaint effects are infinitely
varied and picturesque.  The trees in no two avenues are shaped alike, and
consequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the nature of monotonous
uniformity.  I will drop this subject now, leaving it to others to determine
how these people manage to make endless ranks of lofty forest trees grow to
just a certain thickness of trunk (say a foot and two-thirds); how they make
them spring to precisely the same height for miles; how they make them grow so
close together; how they compel one huge limb to spring from the same identical
spot on each tree and form the main sweep of the arch; and how all these things
are kept exactly in the same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness
and symmetry
<hr><i>page 156</i><br>
month after month and year after year--for I have tried to reason
out the problem and have failed.<p>
We walked through the great hall of sculpture and the one hundred and fifty
galleries of paintings in the palace of Versailles, and felt that to be in such
a place was useless unless one had a whole year at his disposal.  These
pictures are all battle scenes, and only one solitary little canvas among them
all treats of anything but great French victories.  We wandered, also, through
the Grand Trianon and the Petit Trianon, those monuments of royal prodigality,
and with histories so mournful--filled, as it is, with souvenirs of Napoleon
the First, and three dead kings and as many queens.  In one sumptuous bed they
had all slept in succession, but no one occupies it now.  In a large dining
room stood the table at which Louis XIV and his mistress Madame Maintenon, and
after them Louis XV, and Pompadour, had sat at their meals naked and
unattended--for the table stood upon a trapdoor, which descended with it to
regions below when it was necessary to replenish its dishes.  In a room of the
Petit Trianon stood the furniture, just as poor Marie Antoinette left it when
the mob came and dragged her and the King to Paris, never to return.  Near at
hand, in the stables, were prodigious carriages that showed no color but
gold--carriages used by former kings of France on state occasions, and never
used now save when a kingly head is to be crowned or an imperial infant
christened.  And with them were some curious sleighs, whose bodies were shaped
like lions, swans, tigers, etc.--vehicles that had once been handsome with
pictured designs and fine workmanship, but were dusty and decaying now.  They
had their history.  When Louis XIV had finished the Grand Trianon, he told
Maintenon he had created a paradise for her, and asked if she could think of
anything now to wish for.  He said he wished the Trianon to be
perfection--nothing less.  She said she could think of but one thing--it was
summer, and it was balmy France--yet she would like well to sleigh ride in the
leafy avenues of Versailles!  The next morning found miles and miles of grassy
avenues spread thick with snowy salt and
<hr><i>page 157</i><br>
sugar, and a procession of those
quaint sleighs waiting to receive the chief concubine of the gaiest and most
unprincipled court that France has ever seen!<p>
From sumptuous Versailles, with its palaces, its statues, its gardens, and its
fountains, we journeyed back to Paris and sought its antipodes--the Faubourg
St. Antoine.  Little, narrow streets; dirty children blockading them; greasy,
slovenly women capturing and spanking them; filthy dens on first floors, with
rag stores in them (the heaviest business in the Faubourg is the chiffonier's);
other filthy dens where whole suits of second- and third-hand clothing are sold
at prices that would ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock; still
other filthy dens where they sold groceries--sold them by the
halfpennyworth--five dollars would buy the man out, goodwill and all.  Up these
little crooked streets they will murder a man for seven dollars and dump the
body in the Seine.  And up some other of these streets--most of them, I should
say--live lorettes.<p>
All through this Faubourg St. Antoine, misery, poverty, vice, and crime go hand
in hand, and the evidences of it stare one in the face from every side.  Here
the people live who begin the revolutions.  Whenever there is anything of that
kind to be done, they are always ready.  They take as much genuine pleasure in
building a barricade as they do in cutting a throat or shoving a friend into
the Seine.  It is these savage-looking ruffians who storm the splendid halls of
the Tuileries occasionally, and swarm into Versailles when a king is to be
called to account.<p>
But they will build no more barricades; they will break no more soldiers' heads
with paving stones.  Louis Napoleon has taken care of all that.  He is
annihilating the crooked streets and building in their stead noble boulevards
as straight as an arrow--avenues which a cannon ball could traverse from end to
end without meeting an obstruction more irresistible than the flesh and bones
of men--boulevards whose stately edifices will never afford refuges and
plotting places for starving, discontented revolution breeders.  Five of these
great thoroughfares <hr><i>page 158</i><br>
radiate from one ample center--a center which is
exceedingly well adapted to the accommodation of heavy artillery.  The mobs
used to riot there, but they must seek another rallying place in future.  And
this ingenious Napoleon paves the streets of his great cities with a smooth,
compact composition of asphaltum and sand.  No more barricades of
flagstones--no more assaulting his majesty's troops with cobbles.  I cannot
feel friendly toward my quondam fellow American Napoleon III, especially at
this time,* when in fancy I see his credulous victim, Maximilian, lying stark
and stiff in Mexico, and his maniac widow watching eagerly from her French
asylum for the form that will never come--but I do admire his nerve, his calm
self-reliance, his shrewd good sense.
