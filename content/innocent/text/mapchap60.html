<h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER LX.</h3></center>

<p>TEN or eleven o'clock found us coming down to breakfast one morning in Cadiz. They told us the ship had been
lying at anchor in the harbor two or three hours. It was time for us to bestir ourselves. The ship could wait only
a little while because of the quarantine. We were soon on board, and within the hour the white city and the
pleasant shores of Spain sank down behind the waves and passed out of sight. We had seen no land fade from view
so regretfully.

</p><p>It had long ago been decided in a noisy public meeting in the main cabin that we could not go to Lisbon,
because we must surely be quarantined there. We did every thing by mass-meeting, in the good old national way, from
swapping off one empire for another on the programme of the voyage down to complaining of the cookery and the
scarcity of napkins. I am reminded, now, of one of these complaints of the cookery made by a passenger. The coffee
had been steadily growing more and more execrable for the space of three weeks, till at last it had ceased to be coffee
altogether and had assumed the nature of mere discolored water--so this person said. He said it was so weak that it was
transparent an inch in depth around the edge of the cup. As he approached the table one morning he saw the transparent
edge--by means of his extraordinary vision long before he got to his seat. He went back and complained in a
high-handed way to Capt. Duncan. He said the coffee was disgraceful. The Captain showed his. It seemed tolerably
good. The incipient mutineer was more outraged than ever, then, at what he denounced as the partiality shown

the captain's table over the other tables in the ship. He flourished back and got his cup and set it down triumphantly,
and said:

</p><p>"Just try that mixture once, Captain Duncan."

</p><p>He smelt it--tasted it--smiled benignantly--then said:

</p><p>"It <i>is</i> inferior--for <i>coffee</i>--but it is pretty fair <i>tea</i>."

</p><p>The humbled mutineer smelt it, tasted it, and returned to his seat. He had made an egregious ass of himself
before the whole ship. He did it no more. After that he took things as they came. That was me.

</p><p>The old-fashioned ship-life had returned, now that we were no longer in sight of land. For days and days it
continued just the same, one day being exactly like another, and, to me, every one of them pleasant. At last we anchored
in the open roadstead of Funchal, in the beautiful islands we call the Madeiras.

</p><p>The mountains looked surpassingly lovely, clad as they were in living, green; ribbed with lava ridges; flecked
with white cottages; riven by deep chasms purple with shade; the great slopes dashed with sunshine and mottled with
shadows flung from the drifting squadrons of the sky, and the superb picture fitly crowned by towering peaks whose
fronts were swept by the trailing fringes of the clouds.

</p><p>But we could not land. We staid all day and looked, we abused the man who invented quarantine, we held
half a dozen mass-meetings and crammed them full of interrupted speeches,

</p><hr /><i>Page 640</i><br /><p>

motions that fell still-born, amendments that came to nought and resolutions that died from sheer exhaustion in trying
to get before the house. At night we set sail.

</p><p>We averaged four mass-meetings a week for the voyage--we seemed always in labor in this way, and yet
so often fallaciously that whenever at long intervals we were safely delivered of a resolution, it was cause for public
rejoicing, and we <a name="x">hoisted the flag </a> and fired a salute.

</p><p>Days passed--and nights; and then the beautiful Bermudas rose out of the sea, we entered the tortuous channel,
steamed hither and thither among the bright summer islands, and rested at last under the flag of England and were
welcome. We were not a nightmare here, where were civilization and intelligence in place of Spanish and Italian
superstition, dirt and dread of cholera. A few days among the breezy groves, the flower gar-



</p><hr /><i>Page 641</i><br /><p>

dens, the coral caves, and the lovely vistas of blue water that went curving in and out, disappearing and anon again
appearing through jungle walls of brilliant foliage, restored the energies dulled by long drowsing on the ocean, and fitted
us for our final cruise--our little run of a thousand miles to New York--America--<font size="-1">HOME</font>.

</p><p>We bade good-bye to "our friends the Bermudians," as our programme hath it--the majority of those we
were most intimate with were negroes--and courted the great deep again. I said the majority. We knew more negroes
than white people, because we had a deal of washing to be done, but we made some most excellent friends among the
whites, whom it will be a pleasant duty to hold long in grateful remembrance.

</p><p>We sailed, and from that hour all idling ceased. Such another system of overhauling, general littering of cabins
and packing of trunks we had not seen since we let go the anchor in the harbor of Beirout. Every body was busy. Lists
of all purchases had to be made out, and values attached, to facilitate matters at the custom-house. Purchases bought
by bulk in partnership had to be equitably divided, outstanding debts canceled, accounts compared, and trunks, boxes
and packages labeled. All day long the bustle and confusion continued.

</p><p>And now came our first accident. A passenger was running through a gangway, between decks, one
stormy night, when he caught his foot in the iron staple of a door that had been heedlessly left off a hatchway, and
the bones of his leg broke


</p><hr /><i>Page 642</i><br /><p>

at the ancle. It was our first serious misfortune. We had traveled much more than twenty thousand miles, by land and
sea, in many trying climates, without a single hurt, without a serious case of sickness and without a death among five
and sixty passengers. Our good fortune had been wonderful. A sailor had jumped overboard at Constantinople one
night, and was seen no more, but it was suspected that his object was to desert, and there was a slim chance, at least,
that he reached the shore. But the passenger list was complete. There was no name missing from the register.

</p><p>At last, one pleasant morning, we steamed up the harbor of New York, all on deck, all dressed in Christian
garb--by special order, for there was a latent disposition in some quarters to come out as Turks--and amid a waving
of handkerchiefs from welcoming friends, the glad pilgrims noted the shiver of the decks that told that ship and pier
had joined hands again and the long, strange cruise was over. Amen.
