<h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER LIX.</h3>

<hr><i>Page 635</i><br>



    <p>WE were at sea now, for a very long voyage--we were to
    pass through the entire length of the Levant; through
    the entire length of the Mediterranean proper, also, and then
cross the full width of the Atlantic--a voyage
 of several weeks.  We naturally settled down into a very slow,
    stay-at-home manner of life, and resolved to be quiet, exemplary
    people, and roam no more for twenty or thirty days. No more, at
    least, than from stem to stern of the ship. It was a very
    comfortable prospect, though, for we were tired and needed a long
    rest.

    </p><p>We were all lazy and satisfied, now, as the meager entries
    in my note-book (that sure index, to me, of my condition,)
    prove. What a stupid thing a note-book gets to be at sea, any
    way. Please observe the style:

       </p><p><font size=-1><blockquote>

"<i>Sunday</i>--Services, as usual, at four bells. Services at night,
also. No cards.

</p><p>"<i>Monday</i>--Beautiful day, but rained hard. The cattle
purchased at Alexandria for beef ought to be shingled. Or else fattened.
The water stands in deep puddles in the depressions forward of their
    after shoulders. Also here and there all over their backs. It is
    well they are not cows--it would soak in and ruin the milk. The poor
    devil eagle* from Syria looks miserable and droopy in the rain,
    perched on the forward capstan. He appears to have his own
    opinion of a sea voyage, and if it were put into language and the
    language solidified, it would probably essentially dam the
    widest river in the world.

</p><p>"<i>Tuesday</i>--Somewhere in the neighborhood of the island of
Malta. Can not stop there. Cholera. Weather very stormy. Many passengers
seasick and invisible.

</p><p>"<i>Wednesday</i>--Weather still very savage. Storm blew two land
birds to sea, and they came on board. A hawk was blown off, also. He
    circled round and round the ship, wanting to light, but afraid of
    the people. He was so tired, though, that he had to light, at
    last, or perish. He stopped in the foretop, repeatedly, and was as
    often blown away by the wind. At last Harry caught him. Sea full
    of flying-fish. They rise in flocks of three hundred and flash
    along above the tops of the waves a distance of two or three
    hundred feet, then fall and disappear.

</p><p>"<i>Thursday</i>--Anchored off Algiers, Africa. Beautiful city,
beautiful green hilly landscape behind it. Staid half a day and left. Not
permitted to land, though we showed a clean bill of health. They were
afraid of Egyptian plague and cholera.

</p><p>"<i>Friday</i>--Morning, dominoes. Afternoon, dominoes. Evening,
    promenading the deck. Afterwards, charades.

</p><p>"<i>Saturday</i>--Morning, dominoes. Afternoon, dominoes. Evening,
    promenading the decks. Afterwards, dominoes.

</p><p>"<i>Sunday</i>--Morning service, four bells. Evening service, eight
bells. Monotony till midnight.--Whereupon, dominoes.

</p><p>"<i>Monday</i>--Morning, dominoes. Afternoon, dominoes. Evening,
promenading the decks. Afterward, charades and a lecture from Dr. C.
Dominoes.

</p><p>"<i>No date</i>--Anchored off the picturesque city of Cagliari,
Sardinia. Staid till midnight, but not permitted to land by these infamous
foreigners. They smell inodorously--they do not wash--they dare not risk
cholera.

</p><p>"<i>Thursday</i>--Anchored off the beautiful cathedral city of
Malaga, Spain.--Went ashore in the captain's boat--not ashore, either, for
they would not let us land. Quarantine. Shipped my newspaper
correspondence, which they took with tongs, dipped it in sea water,
clipped it full of holes, and then fumigated it with villainous vapors
till it smelt like a Spaniard. Inquired about chances to run to blockade
and visit the Alhambra at Granada. Too risky--they might hang a body. Set
sail--middle of afternoon.

</p><p><font size=-1><blockquote>"And so on, and so on, and so forth, for
several days. Finally, anchored off Gibraltar, which looks familiar and
home-like."</blockquote></font>

</p><p>It reminds me of the journal I opened with the New Year,
once, when I was a boy and a confiding and a willing prey to
    those impossible schemes of reform which well-meaning old
    maids and grandmothers set for the feet of unwary youths at
    that season of the year--setting oversized tasks for them,
    which, necessarily failing, as infallibly weaken the boy's
    strength of will, diminishsh his confidence in himself and injure
    his chances of success in life. Please accept of an extract:

     </p><p><font size=-1><blockquote>
"<i>Monday</i>--Got up, washed, went to bed.<br>
    "<i>Tuesday</i>--Got up, washed, went to bed.<br>
    "<i>Wednesday</i>--Got up, washed, went to bed.<br>
    "<i>Thursday</i>--Got up, washed, went to bed.<br>
    "<i>Friday</i>--Got up, washed, went to bed.<br>
    "<i>Next Friday</i>--Got up, washed, went to bed.<br>
    "<i>Friday fortnight</i>--Got up, washed, went to bed.<br>
    "<i>Following month</i>--Got up, washed, went to
bed."</blockquote></font>

         </p><p>I stopped, then, discouraged. Startling events appeared to
    be too rare, in my career, to render a diary necessary. I still
    reflect with pride, however, that even at that early age I
    washed when I got up. That journal finished me. I never
    have had the nerve to keep one since. My loss of confidence
    in myself in that line was permanent.



</p><p>The ship had to stay a week or more at Gibraltar to take
in coal for the home voyage.

</p><p>It would be very tiresome staying here, and so four of us ran the
quarantine blockade and spent seven delightful days in Seville,
    Cordova, Cadiz, and wandering through the pleasant rural scenery
    of Andalusia, the garden of Old Spain.  The experiences of that
    cheery week were too varied and numerous for a short chapter and
    I have not room for a long one.  Therefore I shall leave them all
    out.
