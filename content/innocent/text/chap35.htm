<h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER XXXV.</h3>

<hr><i>Page 381</i><br>
<p>WE left a dozen passengers in Constantinople, and sailed through the
beautiful Bosporus and far up into the Black Sea. We left them in the
clutches of the celebrated Turkish guide, "FAR-AWAY MOSES," who will
seduce them into buying a ship-load of ottar of roses, splendid Turkish
vestments, and ail manner of curious things they can never have any use
for. Murray's invaluable guide-books have mentioned Far-away Moses'
name, and he is a made man. He rejoices daily in the fact that he is a
recognized celebrity. However, we can not alter our established customs
to
please the whims of guides; we can not show partialities this late in the
day. Therefore, ignoring this fellow's brilliant fame, and ignoring the
fanciful name he takes such pride in, we called him Ferguson, just as we
had done with all other guides. It has kept him in a state of smothered
exasperation all the time. Yet we meant him no harm. After he has gotten
himself up regardless of expense, in showy, baggy trowsers, yellow,
pointed slippers, fiery fez, silken jacket of blue, voluminous waist-sash
of
fancy Persian stuff filled with a battery of silver-mounted horse-pistols,
and has strapped on his terrible scimetar, he considers it an unspeakable
humiliation to be called Ferguson. It can not be helped. All guides are
Fergusons to us. We can not master their dreadful foreign names.

</p><p>Sebastopol is probably the worst battered town in Russia or any
where else. But we ought to be pleased with it, nevertheless, for we have
been in no country yet where we have been so kindly received, and where
we felt that to be Americans

<hr><i>Page 382</i><br>
was a sufficient <i>vis&eacute;</i> for our passports. The moment the
anchor was down, the Governor of the town immediately dispatched
an officer on board to inquire if he could be of any assistance to us, and to
invite us to make ourselves at home in Sebastopol! If you know Russia, you
know that this was a wild stretch of hospitality. They are usually so
suspicious of strangers that they worry them excessively with the delays
and aggravations incident to a complicated passport system. Had we come
from any other country we could not have had permission to enter
Sebastopol and leave again under three days--but as it was, we were at
liberty to go and come when and where we pleased. Every body in
Constantinople warned us to be very careful about our passports, see that
they were strictly <i>en regle</i>, and never to mislay them for a moment:
and they told us of numerous instances of Englishmen and others who
were delayed days, weeks, and even months, in Sebastopol, on account of
trifling informalities in their passports, and for which they were not to
blame. I had lost my passport, and was traveling under my room-mate's,
who stayed behind in Constantinople to await our return. To read the
description of him in that passport and then look at me, any man could see
that I was no more like him than I am like Hercules. So I went into the
harbor of Sebastopol with fear and trembling--full of a vague, horrible
apprehension that I was going to be found out and hanged. But all that
time my true passport

<hr><i>Page 383</i><br>
had been floating gallantly overhead--and behold it was only our flag.
They never asked us for any other.
</p><p>We have had a great many Russian and English gentlemen and
ladies on board to-day, and the time has passed cheerfully away. They
were all happy-spirited people, and I never heard our mother tongue
sound so pleasantly as it did when it fell from those English lips in this
far-off land. I talked to the Russians a good deal, just to be friendly, and
they talked to me from the same motive; I am sure that both enjoyed the
conversation, but never a word of it either of us understood. I did most of
my talking to those English people though, and I am sorry we can not carry
some of them along with us.
</p><p>We have gone whithersoever we chose, to-day, and have met with
nothing but the kindest attentions. Nobody inquired whether we had any
passports or not.
</p><p>Several of the officers of the Government have suggested that we
take the ship to a little watering-place thirty miles from here, and pay
the
Emperor of Russia a visit. He is rusticating there. These officers said they
would take it upon themselves to insure us a cordial reception. They said
if
we would go, they would not only telegraph the Emperor, but send a
special courier overland to announce our coming. Our time is so short,
though, and more especially our coal is so nearly out, that we judged it
best to forego the rare pleasure of holding social intercourse with an
Emperor.
</p><p>Ruined Pompeii is in good condition compared to Sebastopol. Here,
you may look in whatsoever direction you please, and your eye encounters
scarcely any thing but ruin, ruin, ruin!--fragments of houses, crumbled
walls, torn and ragged hills, devastation every where! It is as if a mighty
earthquake had spent all its terrible forces upon this one little spot. For
eighteen long months the storms of war beat upon the helpless town, and
left it at last the saddest wreck that ever the sun has looked upon. Not one
solitary house escaped unscathed--not one remained habitable, even. Such
utter and complete ruin one could hardly conceive of. The houses had all
been solid, dressed stone structures; most of them were ploughed

<hr><i>Page 384</i><br>
through and through by cannon balls--unroofed and sliced down from
eaves to foundation--and now a row of them, half a mile long, looks
merely
like an endless procession of battered chimneys. No semblance of a house
remains in such as these. Some of the larger buildings had corners knocked
off; pillars cut in two; cornices smashed; holes driven straight through
the
walls. Many of these holes are as round and as cleanly cut as if they had
been made with an auger. Others are half pierced through, and the clean
impression is there in the rock, as smooth and as shapely as if it were
done
in putty. Here and there a ball still sticks in a wall, and from it iron tears
trickle down and discolor the stone.
</p><p>The battle-fields were pretty close together. The Malakoff tower
is
on a hill which is right in the edge of the town. The Redan was within
rifle-shot of the Malakoff; Inkerman was a mile away; and Balaklava
removed but an hour's ride. The French trenches, by which they
approached and invested the Malakoff were carried so close under its
sloping sides that one might have stood by the Russian guns and tossed a
stone into them. Repeatedly, during three terrible days, they swarmed up
the little Malakoff hill, and were beaten back with terrible slaughter.
Finally, they captured the place, and drove the Russians out, who then
tried to retreat into the town, but the English had taken the Redan, and
shut them off with a wall of flame; there was nothing for them to do but
go
back and retake the Malakoff or die under its guns. They did go back; they
took the Malakoff and retook it two or three times, but their desperate
valor could not avail, and they had to give up at last.
</p><p>These fearful fields, where such tempests of death used to rage,
are
peaceful enough now; no sound is heard, hardly a living thing moves about
them, they are lonely and silent--their desolation is complete.
</p><p>There was nothing else to do, and so every body went to hunting
relics. They have stocked the ship with them. They brought them from the
Malakoff, from the Redan, Inkerman, Balaklava--every where. They have
brought cannon balls,

<hr><i>Page 385</i><br>
broken ramrods, fragments of shell--iron enough to freight a sloop. Some
have even brought bones--brought them laboriously from great distances,
and were grieved to hear the surgeon pronounce them only bones of mules
and oxen. I knew Blucher would not lose an opportunity like this. He
brought a sack full on board and was going for another. I prevailed upon
him not to go. He has already turned his state-room into a museum of
worthless trumpery, which he has gathered up in his travels. He is labeling
his trophies, now. I picked up one a while ago, and found it marked
"Fragment of a Russian General." I carried it out to get a better light upon
it--it was nothing but a couple of teeth and part of the jaw-bone of a
horse.
I said with some asperity:
</p><p>"Fragment of a Russian General! This is absurd. Are you never going
to learn any sense?"
</p><p>He only said: "Go slow--the old woman won't know any different."
[His aunt.]
</p><p>This person gathers mementoes with a perfect recklessness,
now-a-days; mixes them all up together, and then serenely labels them
without any regard to truth, propriety, or even plausibility. I have found
him breaking a stone in two, and labeling half of it "Chunk busted from the
pulpit of Demosthenes," and the other half "Darnick from the Tomb of
Abelard and Heloise." I have known him to gather up a handful of pebbles
by the roadside, and bring them on board ship and label them as coming
from twenty celebrated localities five hundred miles apart. I remonstrate
against these outrages upon reason and truth, of course, but it does no
good. I get the same tranquil, unanswerable reply every time:
</p><p>"It don't signify--the old woman won't know any different."
</p><p>Ever since we three or four fortunate ones made the midnight trip
to Athens, it has afforded him genuine satisfaction to give every body in
the ship a pebble from the Mars-hill where St. Paul preached. He got all
those pebbles on the sea shore, abreast the ship, but professes to have
gathered them

<hr><i>Page 386</i><br>
from one of our party. However, it is not of any use for me to expose the
deception--it affords him pleasure, and does no harm to any body. He says
he never expects to run out of mementoes of St. Paul as long as he is in
reach of a sand-bank. Well, he is no worse than others. I notice that all
travelers supply deficiencies in their collections in the same way. I shall
never have any confidence in such things again while I live.
