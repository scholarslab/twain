<H2>PREFACE</H2>
<p>
This book is a record of a pleasure trip.  If it were a record of
a solemn scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity,
that profundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to
works of that kind, and withal so attractive.  Yet notwithstanding it is only a
record of a pic-nic, it has a purpose, which is to suggest to the reader
how <i>he </i>would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them
with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries
before him.  I make small pretense of showing anyone how he <i>ought </i>to
look at objects of interest beyond the sea--other books do that, and therefore,
even if I were competent to do it, there is no need.<p>
I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travel-writing
that may be charged against me--for I think I have seen with impartial eyes,
and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether wisely or not.<p>
In this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for the <i>Daily
Alta California, </i>of San Francisco, the proprietors of that journal having
waived their rights and given me the necessary permission.  I have also
inserted portions of several letters written for the New York <i>Tribune
</i>and the New York <i>Herald.</i><p>

For months the great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land was chatted
about in the newspapers everywhere in America and discussed at countless
firesides.  It was a novelty in the way of excursions--its like had not been
thought of before,and it compelled that interest which attractive novelties
always command.  It was to be a picnic on a gigantic scale.  The participants
in it, instead of freighting an ungainly steam ferry-boat with youth and beauty
and pies and doughnuts, and paddling up some obscure creek to disembark upon a
grassy lawn and wear themselves out with a long summer day's laborious
frolicking under the impression that it was fun, were to sail away in a great
steamship with flags flying and cannon pealing, and take a royal holiday beyond
the broad ocean in many a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history!
They were to sail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny
Mediterranean; they were to scamper about the decks by day, filling the ship
with shouts and laughter--or read novels and poetry in the shade of the
smokestacks, or watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side, and the
shark, the whale, and other strange monsters of the deep; and at night they
were to dance in the open air, on the upper deck, in the midst of a ballroom
that stretched from horizon to horizon, and was domed by the bending heavens
and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the magnificent moon-dance,
and promenade, and smoke, and sing, and make love, and search the skies for
constellations that never associate with the "Big Dipper" they
<hr><i><page 20</i><br>
were so tired
of; and they were to see the ships of twenty navies--the customs and costumes
of twenty curious peoples--the great cities of half a world--they were to
hob-nob with nobility and hold friendly converse with kings and princes, grand
moguls, and the anointed lords of mighty empires!  It was a brave conception;
it was the offspring of a most ingenious brain.  It was well advertised, but it
hardly needed it: the bold originality, the extraordinary character, the
seductive nature, and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment
everywhere and advertised it in every household in the land.  Who could read
the program of the excursion without longing to make one of the party?  I will
insert it here.  It is almost as good as a map.  As a text for this book,
nothing could be better:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<i>BROOKLYN, February 1st, 1867</i><p>
The undersigned will make an excursion as above during the coming season, and
begs to submit to you the following program:<p>
A first-class steamer, to be under his own command, and capable of
accommodating at least one hundred and fifty cabin passengers, will be
selected, in which will be taken a select company, numbering not more than
three-fourths of the ship's capacity.  There is good reason to believe that
this company can be easily made up in this immediate vicinity, of mutual
friends and acquaintances.<p>
The steamer will be provided with every necessary comfort, including library
and musical instruments.<p>
An experienced physician will be on board.<p>
Leaving New York about June 1st, a middle and pleasant route will be taken
across the Atlantic, and passing through the group of Azores, St. Michael will
be reached in about ten days.  A day or two will be spent here, enjoying the
fruit and wild scenery of these islands, and the voyage continued, and
Gibraltar reached in three or four days.<p>
A day or two will be spent here in looking over the wonderful subterraneous
fortifications, permission to visit these galleries being readily obtained.<p>
From Gibraltar, running along the coasts of Spain and France, Marseilles will
be reached in three days.  Here ample time will be given not only to look over
the city, which was founded six hundred years before the Christian era, and its
artificial port, the finest of the kind in the Mediterranean, but to visit
Paris during the Great Exhibition; and the beautiful city of Lyons, lying
intermediate, from the heights of <hr><i>page 21</i><br>
which, on a clear day, Mont Blanc and the
Alps can be distinctly seen.  Passengers who may wish to extend the time at
Paris can do so, and, passing down through Switzerland, rejoin the steamer at
Genoa.<p>
From Marseilles to Genoa is a run of one night.  The excursionists will have an
opportunity to look over this, the magnificent city of palaces," and visit the
birthplace of Columbus, twelve miles off, over a beautiful road built by
Napoleon I. From this point, excursions may be made to Milan, Lakes Como and
Maggiore, or to Milan, Verona (famous for its extraordinary fortifications),
Padua, and Venice.  Or, if passengers desire to visit Parma (famous for
Correggio's frescoes) and Bologna, they can by rail go on to Florence, and
rejoin the steamer at Leghorn, thus spending about three weeks amid the cities
most famous for art in Italy.<p>
From Genoa the run to Leghorn will be made along the coast in one night, and
time appropriated to this point in which to visit Florence, its palaces and
galleries; Pisa, its cathedral and "Leaning Tower," and Lucca and its baths,
and Roman amphitheater; Florence, the most remote, being distant by rail about
sixty miles.<p>
From Leghorn to Naples (calling at Civita Vecchia to land any who may prefer to
go to Rome from that point), the distance will be made in about thirty-six
hours; the route will lay along the coast of Italy, close by Caprera, Elba, and
Corsica.  Arrangements have been made to take on board at Leghorn a pilot for
Caprera, and, if practicable, a call will be made there to visit the home of
Garibaldi.<p>
Rome [by rail], Herculaneum, Pompeii, Vesuvius, Vergil's tomb, and possibly the
ruins of Paestum can be visited, as well as the beautiful surroundings of
Naples and its charming bay.<p>
The next point of interest will be Palermo, the most beautiful city of Sicily,
which will be reached in one night from Naples.  A day will be spent here, and
leaving in the evening, the course will be taken towards Athens.<p>
Skirting along the north coast of Sicily, passing through the group of Aeolian
Isles, in sight of Stromboli and Vulcania, both active volcanoes, through the
Straits of Messina, with "Scylla" on the one hand and "Charybdis" on the other,
along the east coast of Sicily, and in sight of Mount Etna, along the south
coast of Italy, the west and south coast of Greece, in sight of ancient Crete,
up Athens Gulf, and into the Piraeus, Athens will be reached in two and a half
or three days.  After tarrying here awhile, the Bay of Salamis will be crossed,
and a day given to Corinth, whence the voyage will be continued to
Constantinople, passing on the way through the Grecian Archipelago, the
Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora, and the mouth of the Golden Horn, and arriving
in about forty-eight hours from Athens.<p>
After leaving Constantinople, the way will be taken out through the beautiful
Bosphorus, across the Black Sea to Sebastopol and Balaklava, a run of about
twenty-four hours.  Here it is proposed to remain two days, visiting the
harbors, fortifications, and battlefields of the Crimea; thence back through
the Bosphorus, touching at Constantinople to take in any who may have preferred
to remain there; down through the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles, along the
coasts of ancient Troy and Lydia in Asia, to Smyrna, which will be reached in
two or two and a half days from Constantinople.  A sufficient stay will be made
here to give opportunity of visiting Ephesus, fifty miles distant by rail.<p>
From Smyrna towards the Holy Land the course will lay through the Grecian
<hr><i>page 22</i><br>
Archipelago, close by the Isle of Patmos, along the coast of Asia, ancient
Pamphylia, and the Isle of Cyprus.  Beirut will be reached in three days.  At
Beirut time will be given to visit Damascus; after which the steamer will
proceed to Joppa.<p>
From Joppa, Jerusalem, the River Jordan, the Sea of Tiberias, Nazareth,
Bethany, Bethlehem, and other points of interest in the Holy Land can be
visited, and here those who may have preferred to make the journey from Beirut
<i>through </i>the country, passing through Damascus, Galilee, Capernaum,
Samaria, and by the River Jordan and Sea of Tiberias, can rejoin the steamer.<p>
Leaving Joppa, the next point of interest to visit will be Alexandria, which
will be reached in twenty-four hours.  The ruins of Caesar's Palace, Pompey's
Pillar, Cleopatra's Needle, the Catacombs, and ruins of ancient Alexandria will
be found worth the visit.  The journey to Cairo, one hundred and thirty miles
by rail, can be made in a few hours, and from which can be visited the site of
ancient Memphis, Joseph's Granaries, and the Pyramids.<p>
From Alexandria the route will be taken homeward, calling at Malta, Cagliari
(in Sardinia), and Palma (in Majorca), all magnificent harbors, with charming
scenery, and abounding in fruits.<p>
A day or two will be spent at each place, and leaving Parma in the evening,
Valencia in Spain will be reached the next morning.  A few days will be spent
in this, the finest city of Spain.<p>
From Valencia, the homeward course will be continued, skirting along the coast
of Spain.  Alicant, Carthagena, Palos, and Malaga will be passed but a mile or
two distant, and Gibraltar reached in about twenty-four hours.<p>
A stay of one day will be made here, and the voyage continued to Madeira, which
will be reached in about three days.  Captain Marryatt writes: "I do not know a
spot on the globe which so much astonishes and delights upon first arrival as
Madeira." A stay of one or two days will be made here, which, if time permits,
may be extended, and passing on through the islands, and probably in sight of
the Peak of Teneriffe, a southern track will be taken, and the Atlantic crossed
within the latitudes of the northeast trade winds, where mild and pleasant
weather, and a smooth sea, can always be expected.<p>
A call will be made at Bermuda, which lies directly in this route homeward, and
will be reached in about ten days from Madeira, and after spending a short time
with our friends the Bermudians, the final departure will be made for home,
which will be reached in about three days.<p>
Already, applications have been received from parties in Europe wishing to join
the Excursion there.<p>
The ship will at all times be a home, where the excursionists, if sick, will be
surrounded by kind friends, and have all possible comfort and sympathy.<p>
Should contagious sickness exist in any of the ports named in the program, such
ports will be passed, and others of interest substituted.<p>
The price of passage is fixed at $1,250, currency, for each adult passenger.
Choice of rooms and of seats at the tables apportioned in the order in which
passages are engaged; and no passage considered engaged until ten percent of
the passage money is deposited with the treasurer.<p>
<hr><i>page 23</i><hr>Passengers can remain on board of the steamer, at all ports, if they desire,
without additional expense, and all boating at the expense of the ship.<p>
All passages must be paid for when taken, in order that the most perfect
arrangements be made for starting at the appointed time.<p>
Applications for passage must be approved by the committee before tickets are
issued, and can be made to the undersigned.<p>
Articles of interest or curiosity, procured by the passengers during the
voyage, may be brought home in the steamer free of charge.<p>
Five dollars per day, in gold, it is believed, will be a fair calculation to
make for <i>all</i> traveling expenses onshore and at the various points where
passengers may wish to leave the steamer for days at a time.<p>
The trip can be extended, and the route changed, by <i>unanimous </i>vote of
the passengers.<p>

What was there lacking about that program to make it perfectly irresistible?
Nothing that any finite mind could discover.  Paris, England, Scotland,
Switzerland, Italy--Garibaldi! The Grecian Archipelago! Vesuvius!
Constantinople!  Smyrna!  The Holy Land!  Egypt and "our friends the
Bermudians"! People in Europe desiring to join the excursion--contagious
sickness to be avoided--boating at the expense of the ship--physician on
board--the circuit of the globe to be made if the passengers unanimously
desired it--the company to be rigidly selected by a pitiless "Committee on
Applications"--the vessel to be as rigidly selected by as pitiless a "Committee
on Selecting Steamer." Human
<hr><i>page 24</i><br> nature could not withstand these bewildering
temptations.  I hurried to the treasurer's office and deposited my ten percent.
I rejoiced to know that a few vacant staterooms were still left.  I<i> did
</i>avoid a critical personal examination into my character by that bowelless
committee, but I referred to all the people of high standing I could think of
in the community who would be least likely to know anything about me.<p>
Shortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that the <i>Plymouth
Collection of Hymns </i>would be used on board the ship.  I then paid the
balance of my passage money.<p>
I was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as an
excursionist.  There was happiness in that but it was tame compared to the
novelty of being "select."<p>
This supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to provide
themselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship, with
saddles for Syrian travel, green spectacles and umbrellas, veils for Egypt, and
substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the Holy Land.
Furthermore, it was suggested that although the ship's library would afford a
fair amount of reading matter, it would still be well if each passenger would
provide himself with a few guidebooks, a Bible, and some standard works of
travel.  A list was appended, which consisted chiefly of books relating to the
Holy Land, since the Holy Land was part of the excursion and seemed to be its
main feature.<p>
Reverend Henry Ward Beecher was to have accompanied the expedition, but urgent
duties obliged him to give up the idea.  There were other passengers who could
have been spared better and would have been spared more willingly.  Lieutenant
General Sherman was to have been of the party also, but the Indian war
compelled his presence on the plains.  A popular actress had entered her name
on the ship's books, but something interfered and <i>she </i>couldn't go.  The
"Drummer Boy of the Potomac" deserted, and lo, we had never a celebrity left!<p>
However, we were to have a "battery of guns" from the Navy Department (as per
advertisement) to be used in
<hr><i>page 25</i><br>answering royal salutes; and the document famished
by the Secretary of the Navy, which was to make "General Sherman and party"
welcome guests in the courts and camps of the old world, was still left to us,
though both document and battery, I think, were shorn of somewhat of their
original august proportions.  However, had not we the seductive program still,
with its Paris, its Constantinople, Smyrna, Jerusalem, Jericho, and "our
friends the Bermudians"?  What did we care?
