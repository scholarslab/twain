<center><h3>ASCENT OF VESUVIUS -- CONTINUED.</h3></center>

<p>"SEE Naples and die." Well, I do not know that one
would necessarily die after merely seeing it, but to attempt to
live
there might turn out a little differently. To see Naples as we saw
it in the early dawn from far up on the side of Vesuvius, is to see
a picture of wonderful beauty. At that distance its dingy buildings
looked white -- and so, rank on rank of balconies, windows and
roofs, they piled themselves up from the blue ocean till the
colossal castle of St. Elmo topped the grand white pyramid and
gave the picture symmetry, emphasis and completeness. And when
its lilies turned to roses -- when it blushed under the sun's first
kiss -- it was beautiful beyond all description. One might well
say,
then, "See Naples and die." The frame of the picture was
charming, itself. In front, the smooth sea -- a vast mosaic of many
colors; the lofty islands swimming in a dreamy haze in the
distance; at our end of the city the stately double peak of
Vesuvius, and its strong black ribs and seams of lava stretching
down to the limitless level campagna -- a green carpet that
enchants the eye and leads it on and on, past clusters of trees,
and
isolated houses, and snowy villages, until it shreds out in a
fringe
of mist and general vagueness far away. It is from the Hermitage,
there on the side of Vesuvius, that one should " see Naples and
die."

</p><p>But do not go within the walls and look at it in
detail. That takes away some of the romance of the thing. The
</p><hr /><i>Page 316</i><br /><p>
people are filthy in their habits, and this makes filthy streets 
and
breeds disagreeable sights and smells. There never was a 
community so prejudiced against the cholera as these  Neapolitans
are. But they have good reason to be. The cholera  generally
vanquishes a Neapolitan when it seizes him, because,  you
understand, before the doctor can dig through the dirt and  get at
the disease the man dies. The upper classes take a  sea-bath every
day, and are pretty decent.

</p><p>The streets are generally about wide enough for one
wagon,  and how they do swarm with people! It is Broadway
repeated  in every street, in every court, in every alley! Such
masses,  such throngs, such multitudes of hurrying, bustling,
struggling  humanity! We never saw the like of it, hardly even in
New  York, I think. There are seldom any sidewalks, and when 
there are, they are not often wide enough to pass a man on 
without caroming on him. So everybody walks in the  street -- and
where the street is wide enough, carriages are  forever dashing
along. Why a thousand people are not run  over and crippled every
day is a mystery that no man can  solve.
But if there is an eighth wonder in the world, it must be the 
dwelling-houses of Naples. I honestly believe a good majority 
</p><hr /><i>Page 317</i><br /><p>
of
them are a hundred feet high! And the solid brick walls are  seven
feet through. You go up nine flights of stairs before you  get to
the
"first" floor. No, not nine, but there or thereabouts.  There is a
little bird-cage of an iron railing in front of every  window clear
away up, up, up, among the eternal clouds,  where the roof is, and
there is always somebody looking out of  every window -- people
of ordinary size looking out from the  first floor, people a shade
smaller from the second, people that  look a little smaller yet
from
the third -- and from thence upward they grow smaller and smaller
by a regularly graduated diminution, till the folks in the topmost
windows seem more like birds in an uncommonly tall martin-box
than any thing else. The  perspective of one of these narrow cracks
of streets, with its rows of tall houses stretching away till they
come together in the distance like railway tracks; its
clothes-lines
crossing over at all altitudes and waving their bannered raggedness
over the swarms of people below; and the white-dressed women
perched in balcony railings all the way from the pavement up to
the heavens -- a perspective like that is really worth going into
Neapolitan details to see.</p>

 <center><b>ASCENT OF VESUVIUS -- CONTINUED.</b></center>

<p>Naples, with its immediate suburbs, contains six 
hundred and twenty-five thousand inhabitants, but I am satisfied it
covers no more ground than an American city of one hundred and
fifty thousand. It reaches up into the air infinitely higher than
three
American cities, though, and there is where the secret of it lies.
I
will observe here, in passing, that the contrasts between opulence
and poverty, and magnificence and misery, are more frequent and
more striking in Naples than in Paris even. One must go to the
Bois de Boulogne to  see fashionable dressing, splendid equipages
and stunning liveries, and to the Faubourg St. Antoine to see vice,
misery, hunger, rags, dirt -- but in the thoroughfares of Naples
these things are all mixed together. Naked boys of nine years and
the fancy-dressed children of luxury; shreds and tatters, and
brilliant 
</p><hr /><i>Page 318</i><br /><p>
uniforms; jackass-carts and state-carriages; beggars,
Princes and Bishops, jostle each other in every street. At six
o'clock every evening, all Naples turns out to drive on the
<i>Riviere di Chiaja, </i>(whatever that may mean;) and for
two hours one may stand there and see the motliest and the worst
mixed procession go by that ever eyes beheld. Princes (there are
more Princes than policemen in Naples -- the city is infested with
them) -- Princes who live up seven flights of stairs and don't own
any principalities, will keep a carriage and go hungry; and clerks,
mechanics, milliners and strumpets will go without their dinners
and squander the money on a hack-ride in the Chiaja; the rag-tag
and rubbish of the city stack themselves up, to the number of
twenty or thirty, on a rickety little go-cart hauled by a donkey
not
much bigger than a cat, and they drive in the Chiaja; Dukes and
bankers, in sumptuous carriages and with gorgeous drivers and
footmen, turn out, also, and so the furious procession goes. For
two hours rank and wealth, and obscurity and poverty clatter along
side by side in the wild procession, and then go home serene,
happy, covered with glory!

</p><p>I was looking at a magnificent marble staircase in
the King's palace, the other day, which, it was said, cost five
million francs, and I suppose it did cost half a million, may be.
I
felt as if it must be a fine thing to live in a country where there
was such comfort and such luxury as this. And then I stepped out
musing, and almost walked over a vagabond who was eating his
dinner on the curbstone -- a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes.
When I found that this mustang was clerking in a fruit
establishment (he had the establishment along with him in a
basket,) at two cents a day, and that he had no palace at home
where he lived, I lost some of my enthusiasm concerning the
happiness of living in Italy.

</p><p>This naturally suggests to me a thought about wages
here. Lieutenants in the army get about a dollar a day, and
common soldiers a couple of cents. I only know one clerk -- he
gets four dollars a month. Printers get six dollars and a half a
month, but I have heard of a foreman who gets thirteen. 
</p><hr /><i>Page 319</i><br /><p>
To be
growing suddenly and violently rich, as this man is, naturally
makes him a bloated aristocrat. The airs he puts on are
insufferable.

</p><p>And, speaking of wages, reminds me of prices of
merchandise. In Paris you pay twelve dollars a dozen for Jouvin's
best kid gloves; gloves of about as good quality sell here at three
or four dollars a dozen. You pay five and six dollars apiece for
fine linen shirts in Paris; here and in Leghorn you pay two and a
half. In Marseilles you pay forty dollars for a first-class dress
coat
made by a good tailor, but in Leghorn you can get a full dress suit
for the same money. Here you get handsome business suits at from
ten to twenty dollars, and in Leghorn you can get an overcoat for
fifteen dollars that would cost you seventy in New York. Fine kid
boots are worth eight dollars in Marseilles and four dollars here.
Lyons velvets rank higher in America than those of Genoa. Yet the
bulk of Lyons velvets you buy in the States are made in Genoa and
imported into Lyons, where they receive the Lyons stamp and are
then exported to America. You can buy enough velvet in Genoa
for twenty-five dollars to make a five hundred dollar cloak in New
York -- so the ladies tell me. Of course these things bring me
    back, by a natural and easy transition, to the </p>
<hr /><i>Page 320</i><br />
    <center><b>ASCENT OF  VESUVIUS -- CONTINUED.</b></center>
<p>And thus the wonderful Blue Grotto is suggested to
me. It is situated on the Island of Capri, twenty-two miles from
Naples. We chartered a little steamer and went out there. Of
course, the police boarded us and put us through a health
examination, and inquired into our politics, before they would let
us land. The airs these little insect Governments put on are in the
last degree ridiculous. They even put a policeman on board of our
boat to keep an eye on us as long as we were in the Capri
dominions. They thought we wanted to steal the grotto, I suppose.
It was worth stealing. The entrance to the cave is four feet high
and four feet wide, and is in the face of a lofty perpendicular
cliff
-- the sea-wall. You enter in 
</p><hr /><i>Page 321</i><br /><p>
small boats -- and a tight squeeze it
is, too. You can not go in at all when the tide is up. Once within,
you find yourself in an arched cavern about one hundred and sixty
feet long, one hundred and twenty wide, and about seventy high.
How deep it is no man knows. It goes down to the bottom of the
ocean. The waters of this placid subterranean lake are the
brightest, loveliest blue that can be imagined. They are as
transparent as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the
richest sky that ever bent over Italy. No tint could be more
ravishing, no lustre more superb. Throw a stone into the water,
and the myriad of tiny bubbles that are created flash out a
brilliant
glare like blue theatrical fires. Dip an oar, and its blade turns
to
splendid frosted silver, tinted with blue. Let a man jump in, and
instantly he is cased in an armor more gorgeous than ever kingly
Crusader wore.

</p><p>Then we went to Ischia, but I had already been to
that 
</p><hr /><i>Page 322</i><br /><p>
island and tired myself to death "resting" a couple of days
and studying human villainy, with the landlord of the Grande
Sentinelle for a model. So we went to Procida, and from thence to
Pozzuoli, where St. Paul landed after he sailed from Samos. I
landed at precisely the same spot where St. Paul landed, and so
did Dan and the others. It was a remarkable coincidence. St. Paul
preached to these people seven days before he started to Rome.

</p><p>Nero's Baths, the ruins of Bai&aelig;, the Temple of
Serapis; Cum&aelig;, where the Cum&aelig;n Sybil interpreted the
oracles,
the Lake Agnano, with its ancient submerged city still visible far
down in its depths -- these and a hundred other points of interest
we examined with critical imbecility, but <a name="c">the Grotto</a> of the Dog
claimed our chief attention, because we had heard and read so
much about it. Every body has written about the Grotto del Cane
and its poisonous vapors, from Pliny down to Smith, and every
tourist has held a dog over its floor by the legs to test the
capabilities of the place. The dog dies in a minute and a half --
a
chicken instantly. As a general thing, strangers who crawl in there
to sleep do not get up until they are called. And then they don't
either. The stranger that ventures to sleep there takes a permanent
contract. I longed to see this grotto. I resolved to take a dog and
hold him myself'; suffocate him a little, and time him; suffocate
him some more and then finish him. We reached the grotto at
about three in the afternoon, and proceeded at once to make the
experiments. But now, an important difficulty presented itself. We
    had no dog.</p>
<center><b>
    ASCENT OF VESUVIUS -- CONTINUED.</b></center>
 <p>At the Hermitage we were about fifteen or eighteen
hundred feet above the sea, and thus far a portion of the ascent
had been pretty abrupt. For the next two miles the road was a
mixture -- sometimes the ascent was abrupt and sometimes it was
not: but one characteristic it possessed all the time, without
failure
-- without modification -- it was all uncompromis-
</p><hr /><i>Page 323</i><br /><p> 
ingly and
unspeakably infamous. It was a rough, narrow trail, and led over
an old lava flow -- a black ocean which was tumbled into a
thousand fantastic shapes -- a wild chaos of ruin, desolation, and
barrenness -- a wilderness of billowy upheavals, of furious
whirlpools, of miniature mountains rent asunder -- of gnarled and
knotted, wrinkled and twisted masses of blackness that mimicked
branching roots, great vines, trunks of trees, all interlaced and
mingled together: and all these weird shapes, all this turbulent
panorama, all this stormy, far-stretching waste of blackness, with
its thrilling suggestiveness of life, of action, of boiling,
surging,
furious motion, was petrified! -- all stricken dead and cold in the
instant of its maddest rioting! -- fettered, paralyzed, and left to
glower at heaven in impotent rage for evermore!

</p><p>Finally we stood in a level, narrow valley (a valley
that had been created by the terrific march of some old time
irruption) and on either hand towered the two steep peaks of
Vesuvius. The one we had to climb -- the one that contains the
active volcano -- seemed about eight hundred or one thousand feet
high, and looked almost too straight-up-and-down for any man to
climb, and certainly no mule could climb it with a man on his
back. Four of these native pirates will carry you to the top in a
sedan chair, if you wish it, but suppose they were to slip and let
you fall, -- is it likely that you would ever stop rolling? Not
this
side of eternity, perhaps. We left the mules, sharpened our
finger-nails, and began the ascent I have been writing about so
long, at twenty minutes to six in the morning. The path led
straight
up a rugged sweep of loose chunks of pumice-stone, and for about
every two steps forward we took, we slid back one. It was so
excessively steep that we had to stop, every fifty or sixty steps,
and rest a moment. To see our comrades, we had to look very
nearly straight up at those above us, and very nearly straight down
at those below. We stood on the summit at last -- it had taken an
hour and fifteen minutes to make the trip.

</p><p>What we saw there was simply a circular crater --
a circular ditch, if you please -- about two hundred feet deep, and
four 
</p><hr /><i>Page 324</i><br /><p>
or five hundred feet wide, whose inner wall was about half a
mile in circumference. In the centre of the great circus ring thus
formed, was a torn and ragged upheaval a hundred feet high, all
snowed over with a sulphur crust of many and many a brilliant and
beautiful color, and the ditch inclosed this like the moat of a
castle, or surrounded it as a little river does a little island, if
the
simile is better. The sulphur coating of that island was gaudy in
the extreme -- all mingled together in the richest confusion were
red, blue, brown, black, yellow, white -- I do not know that there
was a color, or shade of a color, or combination of colors,
unrepresented -- and when the sun burst through the morning mists
and fired this tinted magnificence, it topped imperial Vesuvius
like
a jeweled crown!

</p><p>The crater itself -- the ditch -- was not so variegated
in coloring, but yet, in its softness, richness, and unpretentious
elegance, it was more charming, more fascinating to the eye.
There was nothing "loud" about its well-bred and well-creased
look. Beautiful? One could stand and look down upon it for a week
without getting tired of it. It had the semblance of a pleasant
meadow, whose slender grasses and whose velvety mosses were
frosted with a shining dust, and tinted with palest green that
deepened gradually to the darkest hue of the orange leaf, and
deepened yet again into gravest brown, then faded into orange,
then into brightest gold, and culminated in the delicate pink of a
new-blown rose. Where portions of the meadow had sunk, and
where other portions had been broken up like an ice-floe, the
cavernous openings of the one, and the ragged upturned edges
exposed by the other, were hung with a lace-work of soft-tinted
crystals of sulphur that changed their deformities into quaint
shapes
and figures that were full of grace and beauty.

</p><p>The walls of the ditch were brilliant with yellow
banks of sulphur and with lava and pumice-stone of many colors.
No fire was visible any where, but gusts of sulphurous steam
issued silently and invisibly from a thousand little cracks and
fissures in the crater, and were wafted to our noses with every
</p><hr /><i>Page 325</i><br /><p>
breeze. But so long as we kept our nostrils buried in our
handkerchiefs, there was small danger of suffocation.

</p><p>Some of the boys thrust long slips of paper down
into holes and set them on fire, and so achieved the glory of
lighting their cigars by the flames of Vesuvius, and others cooked
eggs over fissures in the rocks and were happy.

</p><p>The view from the summit would have been superb
but for the fact that the sun could only pierce the mists at long
intervals. Thus the glimpses we had of the grand panorama below
were only fitful and unsatisfactory.</p>
<center><b>THE DESCENT.</b></center>
<p>The descent of the mountain was a labor of only
four minutes. Instead of stalking down the rugged path we
ascended, we chose one which was bedded knee-deep in loose
ashes, and ploughed our way with prodigious strides that would
almost have shamed the performance of him of the seven-league
boots.

</p><p>The Vesuvius of today is a very poor affair
compared to the mighty volcano of Kilauea, in the Sandwich
Islands, but I am glad I visited it. It was well worth it.

</p><p>It is said that during one of the grand eruptions of
Vesuvius it discharged massy rocks weighing many tons a
thousand feet into the air, its vast jets of smoke and 
</p><hr /><i>Page 326</i><br /><p>
steam
ascended thirty miles toward the firmament, and clouds of its ashes
were wafted abroad and fell upon the decks of ships seven hundred
and fifty miles at sea! I will take the ashes at a moderate
discount,
if any one will take the thirty miles of smoke, but I do not feel
able to take a commanding interest in the whole story by myself.
