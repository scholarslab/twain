<center><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER XXXIII.</center>

<p>From Athens all through the islands of the Grecian
Archipelago, we saw little but forbidding sea-walls and barren
hills, sometimes surmounted by three or four graceful columns of
some ancient temple, lonely and deserted -- a fitting symbol of the
desolation that has come upon all Greece in these latter ages. We
saw no ploughed fields, very few villages, no trees or grass or
vegetation of any kind, scarcely, and hardly ever an isolated
house. Greece is a bleak, unsmiling desert, without agriculture,
manufactures or commerce, apparently. What supports its
poverty-stricken people or its Government, is a mystery.

</p><p>I suppose that ancient Greece and modern Greece
compared, furnish the most extravagant contrast to be found in
history. George I., an infant of eighteen, and a scraggy nest of
foreign office holders, sit in the places of Themistocles,
Pericles,
and the illustrious scholars and generals of the Golden Age of
Greece. The fleets that were the wonder of the world when the
Parthenon was new, are a beggarly handful of fishing-smacks now,
and the manly people that performed such miracles of valor at
Marathon are only a tribe of unconsidered slaves to-day. The
classic Illyssus has gone dry, and so have all the sources of
Grecian wealth and greatness. The nation numbers only eight
hundred thousand souls, and there is poverty and misery and
mendacity enough among them to furnish forty millions and be
liberal about it. Under King Otho the revenues of the State were
five millions of dollars -- raised from a tax of <i>one-tenth
</i>of all the agricultural products
</p><hr /><i>Page 355</i><br /><p>
of the land (which tenth the
farmer had to bring to the royal granaries on pack-mules any
distance not exceeding six leagues) and from extravagant taxes on
trade and commerce. Out of that five millions the small tyrant
tried to keep an army of ten thousand men, pay all the hundreds
of useless Grand Equerries in Waiting, First Grooms of the
Bedchamber, Lord High Chancellors of the Exploded Exchequer,
and all the other absurdities which these puppy-kingdoms indulge
in, in imitation of the great monarchies; and in addition he set
about building a white marble palace to cost about five millions
itself. The result was, simply: ten into five goes no times and
none
over. All these things could not be done with five millions, and
Otho fell into trouble.

</p><p>
The Greek throne, with its unpromising adjuncts of a ragged
population of ingenious rascals who were out of employment eight
months in the year because there was little for them to borrow and
less to confiscate, and a waste of barren hills and weed-grown
deserts, went begging for a good while. It was offered to one of
Victoria's sons, and afterwards to various other younger sons of
royalty who had no thrones and were out of business, but they all
had the charity to decline the dreary honor, and veneration enough
for Greece's ancient greatness to refuse to mock her sorrowful
rags and dirt with a tinsel throne in this day of her humiliation
--
till they came to this young Danish George, and he took it. He has
finished
</p><hr /><i>Page 356</i><br /><p>
the splendid palace I saw in the radiant moonlight the
other night, and is doing many other things for the salvation of
Greece, they say.

</p><p>We sailed through the barren Archipelago, and into
the narrow channel they sometimes call the Dardanelles and
sometimes the Hellespont. This part of the country is rich in
historic reminiscences, and poor as Sahara in every thing else. For
instance, as we approached the Dardanelles, we coasted along the
Plains of Troy and past the mouth of the Scamander; we saw
where Troy had stood (in the distance,) and where it does not
stand now -- a city that perished when the world was young. The
poor Trojans are all dead, now. They were born too late to see
Noah's ark, and died too soon to see our menagerie. We saw
where Agamemnon's fleets rendezvoused, and away inland a
mountain which the map said was Mount Ida. Within the
</p><hr /><i>Page 357</i><br /><p>
Hellespont we saw where the original first shoddy contract
mentioned in history was carried out, and the "parties of the
second part " gently rebuked by Xerxes. I speak of the famous
bridge of boats which Xerxes ordered to be built over the
narrowest part of the Hellespont (where it is only two or three
miles wide.) A moderate gale destroyed the flimsy structure, and
the King, thinking that to publicly rebuke the contractors might
have a good effect on the next set, called them out before the army
and had them beheaded. In the next ten minutes he let a new
contract for the bridge. It has been observed by ancient writers
that the second bridge was a very good bridge. Xerxes crossed his
host of five millions of men on it, and if it had not been
purposely
destroyed, it would probably have been there yet. If our
Government would rebuke some of our shoddy contractors
occasionally, it might work much good. In the Hellespont we saw
where Leander and Lord Byron swam across, the one to see her
upon whom his soul's affections were fixed with a devotion that
only death could impair, and the other merely for a flyer, as Jack
says. We had two noted tombs near us, too. On one shore slept
Ajax, and on the other Hecuba.

</p><p>
We had water batteries and forts on both sides of the Hellespont,
flying the crimson flag of Turkey, with its white crescent, and
occasionally a village, and sometimes a train of camels; we had all
these to look at till we entered the broad sea of Marmora, and then
the land soon fading from view, we resumed euchre and whist
once more.

</p><p>
We dropped anchor in the mouth of the Golden Horn at daylight
in the morning. Only three or four of us were up to see the great
Ottoman capital. The passengers do not turn out at unseasonable
hours, as they used to, to get the earliest possible glimpse of
strange foreign cities. They are well over that. If we were lying
in
sight of the Pyramids of Egypt, they would not come on deck until
after breakfast, now-a-days.

</p><p>
The Golden Horn is a narrow arm of the sea, which branches
from the Bosporus (a sort of broad river which connects the
Marmora and Black Seas,) and, curving around, divides the
</p><hr /><i>Page 358</i><br /><p>
city
in the middle. Galata and Pera are on one side of the Bosporus,
and the Golden Horn; Stamboul (ancient Byzantium) is upon the
other. On the other bank of the Bosporus is Scutari and other
suburbs of Constantinople. This great city contains a million
inhabitants, but so narrow are its streets, and so crowded together
are its houses, that it does not cover much more than half as much
ground as New York City. Seen from the anchorage or from a
mile or so up the Bosporus, it is by far the handsomest city we
have seen. Its dense array of houses swells upward from the
water's edge, and spreads over the domes of many hills; and the
gardens that peep out here and there, the great globes of the
mosques, and the countless minarets that meet the eye every
where, invest the metropolis with the quaint Oriental aspect one
dreams of when he reads books of eastern travel. Constantinople
makes a noble picture.

</p><p>But its attractiveness begins and ends with its
picturesqueness. From the time one starts ashore till he gets back
again, he execrates it. The boat he goes in is admirably
miscalculated for the service it is built for. It is handsomely and
neatly fitted up, but no man could handle it well in the turbulent
currents that sweep down the Bosporus from the Black Sea, and
few men could row it satisfactorily even in still water. It is a
long,
light canoe (caique,) large at one end and tapering to a knife
blade
at the other. They make that long sharp end the bow, and you can
imagine how these boiling currents spin it about. It has two oars,
and sometimes four, and no rudder. You start to go to a given
point and you run in fifty different directions before you get
there.
First one oar is backing water, and then the other; it is seldom
that
both are going ahead at once. This kind of boating is calculated to
drive an impatient man mad in a week. The boatmen are the
awkwardest, the stupidest, and the <a name="x">most unscientific</a> on earth,
without question.

</p><p>
Ashore, it was -- well, it was an eternal circus. People were
thicker than bees, in those narrow streets, and the men were
dressed in all the outrageous, outlandish, idolatrous, extrava-
</p><hr /><i>Page 359</i><br /><p>
gant,
thunder-and-lightning costumes that ever a tailor with the delirium
tremens and seven devils could conceive of. There was no freak
in dress too crazy to be indulged in; no absurdity too absurd to be
tolerated; no frenzy in ragged diabolism too fantastic to be
attempted. No two men were dressed alike. It was a wild
masquerade of all imaginable costumes -- every struggling throng
in every street was a dissolving view of stunning contrasts. Some
patriarchs wore awful turbans, but the grand mass of the infidel
horde wore the fiery red skull-cap they call a fez. All the
remainder of the raiment they indulged in was utterly
indescribable.

</p><p>The shops here are mere coops, mere boxes,
bath-rooms, closets -- any thing you please to call them -- on the
first floor. The Turks sit cross-legged in them, and work and trade
and smoke long pipes, and smell like -- like Turks. That covers
the ground. Crowding the narrow streets in front of them are
beggars, who beg forever, yet never collect any thing; and
wonderful cripples, distorted out of all semblance of humanity,
almost; vagabonds driving laden asses; porters carrying drygoods
boxes as large as cottages on their backs; peddlers of grapes, hot
corn, pumpkin seeds, and a hundred other things, yelling like
fiends; and sleeping happily, comfortably, serenely, among the
hurrying feet, are the famed dogs of Constantinople; drifting
noiselessly about are squads of Turkish women, draped from chin
to feet in flowing robes, and with snowy veils bound about their
heads, that disclose only the eyes and a vague, shadowy notion of
their features. Seen moving about, far away in the dim, arched
aisles of the Great Bazaar, they look as the shrouded dead must
have looked when they walked forth from their graves amid the
storms and thunders and earthquakes that burst upon Calvary that
awful night of the Crucifixion. A street in Constantinople is a
picture which one ought to see once -- not oftener.

</p><p>And then there was the goose-rancher -- a fellow
who drove a hundred geese before him about the city, and tried to
sell them. He had a pole ten feet long, with a crook in the end of
it, and occasionally a goose would branch out from the flock
</p><hr /><i>Page 360</i><br /><p>
and
make a lively break around the corner, with wings half lifted and
neck stretched to its utmost. Did the goose-merchant get excited?
No. He took his pole and reached after that goose with
unspeakable <i>sang froid -- </i>took a hitch round his neck,
and "yanked" him back to his place in the flock without an
effort. He steered his geese with that stick as easily as another
man
would steer a yawl. A few hours afterward we saw him sitting on
a stone at a corner, in the midst of the turmoil, sound asleep in
the
sun, with his geese squatting around him, or dodging out of the
way of asses and men. We came
</p><hr /><i>Page 361</i><br /><p>
by again, within the hour, and he
was taking account of stock, to see whether any of his flock had
strayed or been stolen. The way he did it was unique. He put the
end of his stick within six or eight inches of a stone wall, and
made the geese march in single file between it and the wall. He
counted them as they went by. There was no dodging that
arrangement.


</p><p>
If you want dwarfs -- I mean just a few dwarfs for a curiosity --
go to Genoa. If you wish to buy them by the gross, for retail, go
to Milan. There are plenty of dwarfs all over Italy, but it did
seem
to me that in Milan the crop was luxuriant. If you would see a fair
average style of assorted cripples, go to Naples, or travel through
the Roman States. But if you would see the very heart and home
of cripples and human monsters, both, go straight to
Constantinople. A beggar in Naples who can show a foot which
has all run into one horrible toe, with one shapeless nail on it,
has
a fortune -- but such an exhibition as that would not provoke any
notice in Constantinople. The man would starve. Who would pay
any attention to attractions like his among the rare monsters that
throng the bridges of the Golden Horn and display their
deformities in the gutters of Stamboul? O, wretched impostor!
How could he stand against the three-legged woman, and the man
with his eye in his cheek? How would he blush in presence of the
man with fingers on his elbow? Where would he hide himself
when the dwarf with seven fingers on each hand, no upper lip, and
his under-jaw gone, came down in his majesty? Bismillah! The
cripples of Europe are a delusion and a fraud. The truly gifted
flourish only in the by-ways of Pera and Stamboul.

</p><p>
That three-legged woman lay on the bridge, with her stock ln
trade so disposed as to command the most striking effect --  one
natural leg, and two long, slender, twisted ones with feet on them
like somebody else's fore-arm. Then there was a man further along
who had no eyes, and whose face was the color of a fly-blown
beefsteak, and wrinkled and twisted like a lava-flow -- and verily
so tumbled and distorted were his fea-
</p><hr /><i>Page 362</i><br /><p>
tures that no man could tell
the wart that served him for a nose from his cheek-bones. In
Stamboul was a man with a prodigious head, an uncommonly long
body, legs eight inches long and feet like snow-shoes. He traveled
on those feet and his hands, and was as sway-backed as if the
Colossus of Rhodes had been riding him. Ah, a beggar has to have
exceedingly good points to make a living in Constantinople. A
blue-faced man, who had nothing to offer except that he had been
blown up in a mine, would be regarded as a rank impostor, and a
mere damaged soldier on crutches would never make a cent. It
would pay him to get a piece of his head taken off, and cultivate
a wen like a carpet sack.

</p><p>The Mosque of St. Sophia is the chief lion of
Constantinople. You must get a firman and hurry there the first
thing. We did that. We did not get a firman, but we took along
four or five francs apiece, which is much the same thing.

</p><p>
I do not think much of the Mosque of St. Sophia. I suppose I
lack appreciation. We will let it go at that. It is the rustiest
old
barn in heathendom. I believe all the interest that attaches to it
comes from the fact that it was built for a Christian church and
then turned into a mosque, without much alteration, by the
Mohammedan conquerors of the land. They made me take off my
boots and walk into the place in my stocking-feet. I caught cold,
and got myself so stuck up with a complication of gums, slime and
general corruption, that I wore out more than two thousand pair of
boot-jacks getting my boots off that night, and even then some
Christian hide peeled off with them. I abate not a single
boot-jack.

</p><p>
St. Sophia is a colossal church, thirteen or fourteen hundred
years old, and unsightly enough to be very, very much older. Its
immense dome is said to be more wonderful than St. Peter's, but
its dirt is much more wonderful than its dome, though they never
mention it. The church has a hundred and seventy pillars in it,
each a single piece, and all of costly marbles of various kinds,
but
they came from ancient temples at Baalbec, Heliopolis, Athens and
Ephesus, and are battered, ugly and repulsive. They were a
thousand years old when this
</p><hr /><i>Page 363</i><br /><p>
church was new, and then the
contrast must have been ghastly -- if Justinian's architects did
not
trim them any. The inside of the dome is figured all over with a
monstrous inscription in Turkish characters, wrought in gold
mosaic, that looks as glaring as a circus bill; the pavements and
the marble balustrades are all battered and dirty; the perspective
is marred every where by a web of ropes that depend from the
dizzy height of the dome, and suspend countless dingy, coarse oil
lamps, and ostrich-eggs, six or seven feet above the floor.
Squatting and sitting in groups, here and there and far and near,
were ragged Turks reading books, hearing sermons, or receiving
lessons like children. and in fifty places were more
</p><hr /><i>Page 364</i><br /><p>
of the same
sort bowing and straightening up, bowing again and getting down
to kiss the earth, muttering prayers the while, and keeping up
their
gymnastics till they ought to have been tired, if they were not.

</p><p>Every where was dirt, and dust, and dinginess, and
gloom; every where were signs of a hoary antiquity, but with
nothing touching or beautiful about it; every where were those
groups of fantastic pagans; overhead the gaudy mosaics and the
web of lamp-ropes -- nowhere was there <a name="d">any thing</a> to win one's
love or challenge his admiration.

</p><p><a name="c">The people who</a> go into ecstacies over St. Sophia
must surely get them out of the guide-book (where every church
is spoken of as being "considered by good judges to be the most
marvelous structure, in many respects, that the world has ever
seen.") Or else they are those old connoisseurs from the wilds of
New Jersey who laboriously learn the difference between a fresco
and a fire-plug and from that day forward feel privileged to void
their critical bathos on painting, sculpture and architecture
forever
more.

</p><p>We visited the Dancing Dervishes. There were
twenty-one of them. They wore a long, light-colored loose robe
that hung to their heels. Each in his turn went up to the priest
(they were all within a large circular railing) and bowed
profoundly and then went spinning away deliriously and took his
appointed place in the circle, and continued to spin. When all had
spun themselves to their places, they were about five or six feet
apart -- and so situated, the entire circle of spinning pagans spun
itself three separate times around the room. It took twenty-five
minutes to do it. They spun on the left foot, and kept themselves
going by passing the right rapidly before it and digging it against
the waxed floor. Some of them made incredible " time." Most of
them spun around forty times in a minute, and one artist averaged
about sixty-one times a minute, and kept it up during the whole
twenty-five. His robe filled with air and stood out all around him
like a balloon.

</p><p>They made no noise of any kind, and most of them
tilted their heads back and closed their eyes, entranced with a
sort
of
</p><hr /><i>Page 365</i><br /><p>
devotional ecstacy. There was a rude kind of music, part of the
time, but the musicians were not visible. None but spinners were
allowed within the circle. A man had to either spin or stay
outside.
It was about as barbarous an exhibition as we have witnessed yet.
Then sick persons came and lay down, and beside them women
laid their sick children (one a babe at the breast,) and the
patriarch
of the Dervishes walked upon their bodies. He was supposed to
cure their diseases by trampling upon their breasts or backs or
standing on the back of their necks. This is well enough for a
people who think all their affairs are made or marred by viewless
spirits of the air -- by giants, gnomes, and genii -- and who still
believe, to this day, all the wild tales in the Arabian Nights.
Even
so an intelligent missionary tells me.

</p><p>We visited the Thousand and One Columns. I do
not know what it was originally intended for, but they said it was
built for a reservoir. It is situated in the centre of
Constantinople.
You go down a flight of stone steps in the middle of a barren
place, and there you are. You are forty feet under ground, and in
the midst of a perfect wilderness of tall, slender, granite
columns,
of Byzantine architecture. Stand where you would, or change your
position as often as you pleased, you were always a centre from
which radiated a dozen long archways and colonnades that lost
themselves in distance and the sombre twilight of the place. This
old dried-up reservoir is occupied by a few ghostly silk-spinners
now, and one of them showed me a cross cut high up in one of the
pillars. I suppose he meant me to understand that the institution
was there before the Turkish occupation, and I thought he made a
remark to that effect; but he must have had an impediment in his
speech, for I did not understand him.

</p><p>
We took off our shoes and went into the marble mausoleum of
the Sultan Mahmoud, the neatest piece of architecture, inside, that
I have seen lately. Mahmoud's tomb was covered with a black
velvet pall, which was elaborately embroidered with silver; it
stood
within a fancy silver railing; at the sides and corners were silver
candlesticks that would weigh more
</p><hr /><i>Page 366</i><br /><p>
than a hundred pounds, and
they supported candles as large as a man's leg; on the top of the
sarcophagus was a fez, with a handsome diamond ornament upon
it, which an attendant said cost a hundred thousand pounds, and
lied like a Turk when he said it. Mahmoud's whole family were
comfortably planted around him.

</p><p>We went to the great Bazaar in Stamboul, of
course, and I shall not describe it further than to say it is a
monstrous hive of little shops -- thousands, I should say -- all
under one roof, and cut up into innumerable little blocks by
narrow streets which are arched overhead. One street is devoted
to a particular kind of merchandise, another to another, and so on.

</p><hr /><i>Page 367</i><br /><p>
When you wish to buy a pair of shoes you have the swing of the
whole street -- you do not have to walk yourself down hunting
stores in different localities. It is the same with silks,
antiquities,
shawls, etc. The place is crowded with people all the time, and as
the gay-colored Eastern fabrics are lavishly displayed before every
shop, the great Bazaar of Stamboul is one of the sights that are
worth seeing. It is full of life, and stir, and business, dirt,
beggars,
asses, yelling peddlers, porters, dervishes, high-born Turkish
female shoppers, Greeks, and weird-looking and weirdly dressed
Mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces -- and the
only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the Great
Bazaar,  is something which smells good.
