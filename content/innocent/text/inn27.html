<h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>
</center>

<p>SO far, good. If any man has a right to feel proud of himself,
and satisfied, surely it is
I. For I have written about the Coliseum, and the gladiators, the
martyrs, and the lions, and yet
have never once used the phrase "butchered to make a Roman
holiday." I am the only free white
man of mature age, who has accomplished this since Byron originated
the expression.

</p><p>Butchered to make a Roman holiday sounds well for the first
seventeen or
eighteen hundred thousand times one sees it in print, but after
that it begins to grow tiresome.
I find it in all the books concerning Rome--and here latterly it
reminds me of Judge Oliver.
Oliver was a young lawyer, fresh from the schools, who had gone out
to the deserts of Nevada
to begin life. He found that country, and our ways of life, there,
in those early days, different
from life in New England or Paris. But he put on a woollen shirt
and strapped a navy revolver
to his person, took to the bacon and beans of the country, and
determined to do in Nevada as
Nevada did. Oliver accepted the situation so completely that
although he must have sorrowed
over many of his trials, he never complained--that is, he never
complained but once. He, two
others, and myself, started to the new silver mines in the Humboldt
mountains--he to be Probate
Judge of Humboldt county, and we to mine. The distance was two
hundred miles. It was dead
of winter. We bought a two-horse wagon and put eighteen hundred
pounds of bacon, flour,
beans, blasting-powder, picks and shovels in it; we bought two
sorry-looking
</p><hr /><i>Page 285</i><br /><p>
Mexican "plugs,"
with the hair turned the wrong way and more corners on their bodies
than there are on the
mosque of Omar; we hitched up and started. It was a dreadful trip.
But Oliver did not complain.
The horses dragged the wagon two miles from town and then gave out.
Then we three pushed
the wagon seven miles, and Oliver moved ahead and pulled the horses
after him by the bits. We
complained, but Oliver did not. The ground was frozen, and it froze
our backs while we slept;
the wind swept across our faces and froze our noses. Oliver did not
complain. Five days of
pushing the wagon by day and freezing by night brought us to the
bad part of the journey--the
Forty Mile Desert, or the Great American Desert, if you please.
Still, this mildest-mannered
man that ever was, had not complained. We started across at eight
in the morning, pushing
through sand that had no bottom; toiling all day long by the wrecks
of a thousand wagons, the
skeletons of ten thousand oxen; by wagon-tires enough to hoop the
Washington Monument to
the top, and ox-chains enough to girdle Long Island; by human
graves; with our throats parched
always, with thirst; lips bleeding from the alkali dust; hungry,
perspiring, and very, very weary-
-so weary that when we dropped in the sand every fifty yards to
rest the horses, we could hardly
keep from going to sleep--no complaints from Oliver: none the next
morning at three o'clock,
when we got across, tired to death.
</p><hr /><i>Page 286</i><br /><p>
</p><p>Awakened two or three nights afterward at midnight, in a
narrow canon, by the
snow falling on our faces, and appalled at the imminent danger of
being "snowed in," we
harnessed up and pushed on till eight in the morning, passed the
"Divide" and knew we were
saved. No complaints. Fifteen days of hardship and fatigue brought
us to the end of the two
hundred miles, and the Judge had not complained. We wondered if any
thing <i>could
</i>exasperate him. We built a Humboldt house. It is done in this
way. You dig a square in
the steep base of the mountain, and set up two uprights and top
them with two joists. Then you
stretch a great sheet of "cotton domestic" from the point where the
joists join the hill-side down
over the joists to the ground; this makes the roof and the front of
the mansion; the sides and
back are the dirt walls your digging has left. A chimney is easily
made by turning up one corner
of the roof. Oliver was sitting alone in this dismal den, one
night, by a sage-brush fire, writing
poetry; he was very fond of digging poetry out of himself -- or
blasting it out when it came hard.
He heard an animal's footsteps close to the roof; a stone or two
and some dirt came through and
fell by him. He grew uneasy and said "Hi! -- clear out from there,
can't you!" -- from time to time.
But by and by he fell asleep where he sat, and pretty soon a mule
fell down the chimney! The
fire flew in every direction, and Oliver went over backwards. About
</p><hr /><i>Page 287</i><br /><p>
ten nights after that, he
recovered confidence enough to go to writing poetry again. Again he
dozed off to sleep, and
again a mule fell down the chimney. This time, about half of that
side of the house came in with
the mule. Struggling to get up, the mule kicked the candle out and
smashed most of the kitchen
furniture, and raised considerable dust. These violent awakenings
must have been annoying to
Oliver, but he never complained. He moved to a mansion on the
opposite side of the canon,
because he had noticed the mules did not go there. One night about
eight o'clock he was
endeavoring to finish his poem, when a stone rolled in -- then a hoof
appeared below the canvas --
then part of a cow -- the after part. He leaned back in dread, and
shouted "Hooy! hooy! get out
of this!" and the cow struggled manfully -- lost ground
steadily -- dirt and dust streamed down, and
before Oliver could get well away, the entire cow crashed through
on to the table and made a
shapeless wreck of every thing!

</p><p>Then, for the first time in his life, I think, Oliver
complained. He said,

</p><p><i>"This thing is growing monotonous!"</i>

</p><p>Then he resigned his judgeship and left Humboldt county.
"Butchered to make
a Roman holyday" has grown monotonous to me.

</p><p><a name="z">In this connection</a> I wish to say one word about Michael
Angelo Buonarotti. I
used to worship the mighty genius of Michael Angelo -- that man who
was great in poetry,
painting, sculpture, architecture -- great in every thing he
undertook. But I do not want Michael
Angelo for breakfast -- for luncheon -- for dinner -- for tea -- for
supper -- for between meals. I like a
change, occasionally. In Genoa, he designed every thing; in Milan
he or his pupils designed
every thing; he designed the Lake of Como; in Padua, Verona,
Venice, Bologna, who did we
ever hear of, from guides, but Michael Angelo? In Florence, he
painted every thing, designed
every thing, nearly, and what he did not design he used to sit on
a favorite stone and look at,
and they showed us the stone. In Pisa he designed every thing but
the old shot-tower, and they
would have at-
</p><hr /><i>Page 288</i><br /><p>
tributed that to him if it had not been so awfully out
of the perpendicular. He
designed the piers of Leghorn and the custom house regulations of
Civita Vecchia. But, here --
here it is frightful. He designed St. Peter's; he designed the
Pope; he designed the Pantheon,
the uniform of the Pope's soldiers, the Tiber, the Vatican, the
Coliseum, the Capitol, the
Tarpeian Rock, the Barberini Palace, St. John Lateran, the
Campagna, the Appian Way, the
Seven Hills, the Baths of Caracalla, the Claudian Aqueduct, the
Cloaca Maxima -- the eternal bore
designed the Eternal City, and unless all men and books do lie, he
painted every thing in it! Dan
said the other day to the guide, "Enough, enough, enough! Say no
more! Lump the whole thing!
say that the Creator made Italy from designs by Michael Angelo!"

</p><p>I never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil,
so filled with a blessed
peace, as I did yesterday when I learned that Michael Angelo was
dead.

</p><p>But we have taken it out of this guide. He has marched us
through miles of
pictures and sculpture in the vast corridors of the Vatican; and
through miles of pictures and
sculpture in twenty other palaces; he has shown us the great
picture in the Sistine Chapel, and
frescoes enough to frescoe the heavens--pretty much all done by
Michael Angelo. So with him
we have played that game which has vanquished so many guides for
us--imbecility and idiotic
questions. These creatures never suspect--they have no idea of a
sarcasm.
</p><hr /><i>Page 289</i><br /><p>
</p><p>He shows us a figure and says: "Statoo brunzo." (Bronze
statue.)

</p><p>We look at it indifferently and the doctor asks: "By
Michael Angelo?"

</p><p>"No -- not know who."

</p><p>Then he shows us the ancient Roman Forum. The doctor asks:
"Michael
Angelo?"

</p><p>A stare from the guide. "No -- thousan' year before he is
born."

</p><p>Then an Egyptian obelisk. Again: "Michael Angelo?"

</p><p>"Oh, <i>mon dieu,</i> genteelmen! Zis is <i>two</i> thousan'
year before he is born!"

</p><p>He grows so tired of that unceasing question sometimes, that
he dreads to show us any thing at all. The wretch has tried all the
ways he can think of to make us comprehend
that Michael Angelo is only responsible for the creation of a part
of the world, but somehow he
has not succeeded yet. Relief for overtasked eyes and brain from
study and sightseeing is
necessary, or we shall become idiotic sure enough. Therefore this
guide must continue to suffer.
If he does not enjoy it, so much the worse for him. We do.

</p><p>In this place I may as well jot down a chapter concerning
those necessary
nuisances, European guides. Many a man has wished in his heart he
could do without his guide;
but knowing he could not, has wished he could get some amusement
out of him as a
remuneration for the affliction of his society. We accomplished
this latter matter, and if our
experience can be made useful to others they are welcome to it.

</p><hr /><i>Page 290</i><br />
<p>
Guides know about enough English to tangle every thing up so that
a man can make neither
head or tail of it. They know their story by heart -- the history of
every statue, painting, cathedral
or other wonder they show you. They know it and tell it as a parrot
would -- and if you interrupt,
and throw them off the track, they have to go back and begin over
again. All their lives long,
they are employed in showing strange things to foreigners and
listening to their bursts of
admiration. It is human nature to take delight in exciting
admiration. It is what prompts children
to say "smart" things, and do absurd ones, and in other ways
"showoff" when company is
present. It is what makes gossips turn out in rain and storm to go
and be the first to tell a
startling bit of news. Think, then, what a passion it becomes with
a guide, whose privilege it
is, every day, to show to strangers wonders that throw them into
perfect ecstasies of admiration!
He gets so that he could not by any possibility live in a soberer
atmosphere. After we discovered
this, we <i>never </i>went into ecstacies any more -- we never
admired any thing -- we never
showed any but impassible faces and stupid indifference in the
presence of the sublimest wonders
a guide had to display. We had found their weak point. We have made
good use of it ever since.
We have made some of those people savage, at times, but we have
never lost our own serenity.

</p><p>The doctor asks the questions, generally, because he can
keep his countenance,
and look more like an inspired idiot, and throw more imbecility
into the tone of his voice than
any man that lives. It comes natural to him.

</p><p>The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American
party, because
Americans so much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment and emotion
before any relic of
Columbus. Our guide there fidgeted about as if he had swallowed a
spring mattress. He was full
of animation -- full of impatience. He said:

</p><p>"Come wis me, genteelmen! -- come! I show you ze letter
writing by Christopher
Colombo! -- write it himself! -- write it wis his own hand! -- come!"

</p><hr /><i>Page 291</i><br />
<p>He took us to the municipal palace. After much impressive
fumbling of keys and
opening of locks, the stained and aged document was spread before
us. The guide's eyes
sparkled. He danced about us and tapped the parchment with his
finger:

</p><p>"What I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not so? See! handwriting
Christopher
Colombo! -- write it himself!"

</p><p>We looked indifferent -- unconcerned. The doctor examined the
document very
deliberately, during a painful pause. -- Then he said, without any
show of interest:

</p><p>"Ah -- Ferguson -- what -- what did you say was the name of the
party who wrote
this?"

</p><p>"Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!"

</p><p>Another deliberate examination.

</p><p>"Ah -- did he write it himself; or -- or how?"

</p><p>"He write it himself!--Christopher Colombo! He's own
hand-writing, write by
himself!"

</p><p>Then the doctor laid the document down and said:

</p><p>"Why, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old
that could write better
than that."
</p><hr /><i>Page 292</i><br />
<p>"But zis is ze great Christo--"

</p><p>"I don't care who it is! It's the worst writing I ever saw.
Now you musn't think
you can impose on us because we are strangers. We are not fools, by
a good deal. If you have
got any specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out!--and
if you haven't, drive on!"

</p><p>We drove on. The guide was considerably shaken up, but he
made one more
venture. He had something which he thought would overcome us. He
said:

</p><p>"Ah, genteelmen, you come wis me! I show you beautiful, O,
magnificent bust
Christopher Colombo! -- splendid, grand, magnificent!"

</p><p>He brought us before the beautiful bust -- for it <i>was
</i>beautiful -- and
sprang back and struck an attitude:

</p><p>"Ah, look, genteelmen! -- beautiful, grand, -- bust Christopher
Colombo! -- beautiful
bust, beautiful pedestal!"

</p><p>The doctor put up his eye-glass -- procured for such
occasions:

</p><p>"Ah -- what did you say this gentleman's name was?"

</p><p>"Christopher Colombo! -- ze great Christopher Colombo!"

</p><p>"Christopher Colombo -- the great Christopher Colombo. Well,
what did <i>he
</i>do?"

</p><p>"Discover America! -- discover America, Oh, ze devil!"

</p><p>"Discover America. No -- that statement will hardly wash. We
are just from
America ourselves. We heard nothing about it. Christopher
Colombo -- pleasant name -- is -- is he
dead?"

</p><p>"Oh, corpo di Baccho! -- three hundred year!"

</p><p>"What did he die of?"

</p><p>"I do not know!--I can not tell."

</p><p>"Small-pox, think?"

</p><p>"I do not know, genteelmen! -- I do not know <i>what </i>he
die of!"

</p><p>"Measles, likely?"

</p><p>"May be -- may be -- I do not know -- I think he die of
somethings."

</p><p>"Parents living?"
</p><hr /><i>Page 293</i><br />
<p>"Im-poseeeble!"

</p><p>"Ah -- which is the bust and which is the pedestal?"

</p><p>"Santa Maria!<i> -- zis</i> ze bust! --<i> zis </i>ze
pedestal!"

</p><p>"Ah, I see, I see -- happy combination -- very happy
combination, indeed. Is -- is this
the first time this gentleman was ever on a bust?"

</p><p>That joke was lost on the foreigner -- guides can not master
the subtleties of the
American joke.

</p><p>We have made it interesting for this Roman guide. Yesterday
we spent three or
four hours in the Vatican, again, that wonderful world of
curiosities. We came very near
expressing interest, sometimes -- even admiration -- it was very hard
to keep from it. We succeeded
though. Nobody else ever did, in the Vatican museums. The guide was
bewildered --
non-plussed. He walked his legs off, nearly, hunting up
extraordinary things, and exhausted all
his ingenuity on us, but
</p><hr /><i>Page 294</i><br /><p>
it was a failure; we never showed any
interest in any thing. He had
reserved what he considered to be his greatest wonder till the
last -- a royal Egyptian mummy,
the best preserved in the world, perhaps. He took us there. He felt
so sure, this time, that some
of his old enthusiasm came back to him:

</p><p>"See, genteelmen! -- Mummy! Mummy!"

</p><p>The eye-glass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever.

</p><p>"Ah, -- Ferguson -- what did I understand you to say the
gentleman's name was?"

</p><p>"Name? -- he got no name! -- Mummy! -- 'Gyptian mummy!"

</p><p>" Yes, yes. Born here?"

</p><p>" No! <i>'Gyptian </i>mummy!"

</p><p>"Ah, just so. Frenchman, I presume?"

</p><p>"No! -- <i>not</i> Frenchman, not Roman! -- born in Egypta!"

</p><p>"Born in Egypta. Never heard of Egypta before. Foreign
locality, likely.
Mummy -- mummy. How calm he is -- how self-possessed. Is, ah -- is he
dead?"

</p><p>"Oh, <i>sacre bleu, </i>been dead three thousan' year!"

</p><p>The doctor turned on him savagely:

</p><p>"Here, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this!
Playing us for Chinamen
because we are strangers and trying to learn! Trying to impose your
vile second-hand carcasses
on <i>us!</i> -- thunder and lightning, I've a notion to -- to -- if
you've got a nice <i>fresh
</i>corpse, fetch him out! -- or by George we'll brain you!"

</p><p>We make it exceedingly interesting for this Frenchman.
However, he has paid
us back, partly, without knowing it. He came to the hotel this
morning to ask if we were up,
and he endeavored as well as he could to describe us, so that the
landlord would know which
persons he meant. He finished with the casual remark that we were
lunatics. The observation
was so innocent and so honest that it amounted to a very good thing
for a guide to say.

</p><p>There is one remark (already mentioned,) which never yet has
failed to disgust
these guides. We use it always, when we can think of nothing else
to say. After they have
ex-
</p><hr /><i>Page 295</i><br /><p>
hausted their enthusiasm pointing out to us and praising the
beauties of some ancient bronze
image or broken-legged statue, we look at it stupidly and in
silence for five, ten, fifteen minutes -- as long as we can hold out, in fact--and then ask:

</p><p>"Is -- is he dead?"

</p><p>That conquers the serenest of them. It is not what they are
looking for -- especially
a new guide. Our Roman Ferguson is the most patient, unsuspecting,
long-suffering subject we
have had yet. We shall be sorry to part with him. We have enjoyed
his society very much. We
trust he has enjoyed ours, but we are harassed with doubts.

</p><p>We have been in the catacombs. It was like going down into
a very deep cellar,
only it was a cellar which had no end to it. The narrow passages
are roughly hewn in the rock,
and on each hand as you pass along, the hollowed shelves are carved
out, from three to fourteen
deep; each held a corpse once. There are names, and Christian
symbols, and prayers, or
sentences expressive of Christian hopes, carved upon nearly every
sarcophagus. The dates
belong away back in the dawn of the Christian era, of course. Here,
in these holes in the
ground, the first Christians sometimes burrowed to escape
persecution. They crawled out at
night to get food, but remained under cover in the day time. The
priest told us that St. Sebastian
lived under ground for some time while he was being hunted; he went
out one day, and the
soldiery discovered and shot him to death with arrows. Five or six
of the early Popes -- those who
reigned about sixteen hundred years ago -- held their papal courts
and advised with their clergy
in the bowels of the earth. During seventeen years -- from A. D. 235
to A. D. 252 -- the Popes did
not appear above ground. Four were raised to the great office
during that period. Four years
apiece, or thereabouts. It is very suggestive of the unhealthiness
of underground graveyards as
places of residence. One Pope afterward spent his entire
pontificate in the catacombs -- eight
years. Another was discovered in them and murdered in the episcopal
chair. There was no
satisfaction
</p><hr /><i>Page 296</i><br /><p>
in being a Pope in those days. There were too many
annoyances. There are one
hundred and sixty catacombs under Rome, each with its maze of
narrow passages crossing and
recrossing each other and each passage walled to the top with
scooped graves its entire length.
A careful estimate makes the length of the passages of all the
catacombs combined foot up nine
hundred miles, and their graves number seven millions. We did not
go through all the passages
of all the catacombs. We were very anxious to do it, and made the
necessary arrangements, but
our too limited time obliged us to give up the idea. So we only
groped through the dismal
labyrinth of St. Callixtus, under the Church of St. Sebastian. In
the various catacombs are small
chapels rudely hewn in the stones, and here the early Christians
often held their religious
services by dim, ghostly lights. Think of mass and a sermon away
down in those tangled caverns
under ground!

</p><p>In the catacombs were buried St. Cecilia, St. Agnes, and
several other of the
most celebrated of the saints. In the catacomb of St. Callixtus,
St. Bridget used to remain long
hours in holy contemplation, and St. Charles Borromeo was wont to
spend whole nights in
prayer there. It was also the scene of a very marvelous thing.

</p><p>
<font size="-1">"Here the heart of St. Philip Neri was so inflamed with
divine love as to burst
his ribs."</font>

</p><p>I find that grave statement in a book published in New York
in 1808, and written
by "Rev. William H. Neligan, LL.D., M. A., Trinity College, Dublin;
Member of the
Archaeological Society of Great Britain." Therefore, I believe it.
Otherwise, I could not. Under
other circumstances I should have felt a curiosity to know what
Philip had for dinner.

</p><p>This author puts my credulity on its mettle every now and
then. He tells of one
St. Joseph Calasanctius whose house in Rome he visited; he visited
only the house -- the priest
has been dead two hundred years. He says the Virgin Mary appeared
to this saint. Then he
continues:
</p><hr /><i>Page 297</i><br /><p>
</p><p><font size="-1">"His tongue and his heart, which were found after nearly a
century to be whole,
when the body was disinterred before his canonization, are still
preserved in a glass case, and
after two centuries the heart is still whole. When the French
troops came to Rome, and when
Pius VII. was carried away prisoner, blood dropped from it."
</font>
</p><p>To read that in a book written by a monk far back in the
Middle Ages, would
surprise no one; it would sound natural and proper; but when it is
seriously stated in the middle
of the nineteenth century, by a man of finished education, an
LL.D., M. A., and an
Archaeological magnate, it sounds strangely enough. Still, I would
gladly change my unbelief
for Neligan's faith, and let him make the conditions as hard as he
pleased.

</p><p>The old gentleman's undoubting, unquestioning simplicity has
a rare freshness
about it in these matter-of-fact railroading and telegraphing days.
Hear him, concerning the
church of Ara Coeli:

</p><p><font size="-1">"In the roof of the church, directly above the high altar,
is engraved, <i>'Regina
Coeli laetare Alleluia." </i>In the sixth century Rome was
visited by a fearful
pestilence. Gregory the Great urged the people to do penance, and
a general procession was
formed. It was to proceed from Ara Coeli to St. Peter's. As it
passed before the mole of
Adrian, now the Castle of St. Angelo, the sound of heavenly voices
was heard singing (it was
Easter morn,) <i>Regina Coeli, laetare! alleluia! quia quem
meruisti portare, alleluia!
resurrexit  sicut dixit; alleluia!" </i>The Pontiff, carrying in
his hands the portrait of the
Virgin, (which is over the high altar and is said to have been
painted by St. Luke,) answered,
with the astonished people, <i>'Ora pro nobis Deum, alleluia!'
</i>At the same time an
angel was seen to put up a sword in a scabbard, and the pestilence
ceased on the same day.
There are four circumstances which <i>confirm* </i>this miracle:
the annual procession
which takes place in the western church on the feast of St Mark;
the statue of St. Michael,
placed on the mole of Adrian, which has since that time been called
the Castle of St. Angelo;
the antiphon Regina Coeli which the Catholic church sings
during paschal time; and the
inscription in the church."
