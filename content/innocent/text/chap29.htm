<p>THE ship is lying here in the harbor of Naples--quarantined. She has
been here several days and will remain several more. We that came by rail
from Rome have escaped this misfortune. Of course no one is allowed to go
on board the ship, or come ashore from her. She is a prison, now. The
passengers probably spend the long, blazing days looking out from under
the awnings at Vesuvius and the beautiful city--and in swearing. Think of
ten days of this sort of pastime!--We go out every day in a boat and
request them to come ashore. It soothes them. We lie ten steps from the
ship and tell them how splendid the city is; and how much better the hotel
fare is here than any where else in Europe; and how cool it is; and what
frozen continents of ice cream there are; and what a time we are having
cavorting about the country and sailing to the islands in the Bay. This
tranquilizes them.

</p><p>I shall remember our trip to Vesuvius for many a day--partly
because of its sight-seeing experiences, but chiefly on account of the
fatigue of the journey. Two or three of us had been resting ourselves
among the tranquil and beautiful scenery of the island of Ischia,
eighteen miles out in the harbor, for two days; we called it "resting,"
but I do not remember now what the resting consisted of, for when we got
back to Naples we had not slept for forty-eight hours. We were just about
to go to bed early in the evening, and catch up on

<hr><i>Page 309</i><br>

some of the sleep we had lost, when we heard of this Vesuvius expedition. 
There was to be eight of us in the party, and we were to leave Naples at
midnight. We laid in some provisions for the trip, engaged carriages to
take us to Annunciation, and then moved about the city, to keep awake,
till twelve. We got away punctually, and in the course of an hour and a
half arrived at the town of Annunciation. Annunciation is the very last
place under the sun. In other towns in Italy the people lie around
quietly and wait for you to ask them a question or do some overt act that
can be charged for--but in Annunciation they have lost even that fragment
of delicacy; they seize a lady's shawl from a chair and hand it to her and
charge a penny; they open a carriage door, and charge for it--shut it when
you get out, and charge for it; they help you to take off a duster--two
cents; brush your clothes and make them worse than they were before--two
cents; smile upon you--two cents; bow, with a lick-spittle smirk, hat in
hand--two cents;  they volunteer all information, such as that the mules
will arrive presently--two cents--warm day, sir--two cents--take you four
hours to make the ascent--two cents. And so they go. They crowd
you--infest you--swarm about you, and sweat and smell offensively, and
look sneaking and mean, and obsequious. There is no office too degrading
for them to perform, for money. I have had no op-

<hr><i>Page 310</i><br>

portunity to find out any thing about the upper classes by my own
observation, but from what I hear said about them I judge that what they
lack in one or two of the bad traits the <i>canaille</i> have, they make
up in one or two others that are worse. How the people beg!--many of them
very well dressed, too. 

</p><p>I said I knew nothing against the upper classes by personal
observation. I must recall it! I had forgotten. What I saw their bravest
and their fairest do last night, the lowest multitude that could be
scraped up out of the purlieus of Christendom would blush to do, I think. 
They assembled by hundreds, and even thousands, in the great Theatre of
San Carlo, to do--what? Why, simply, to make fun of an old woman--to
deride, to hiss, to jeer at an actress they once worshipped, but whose
beauty is faded now and whose voice has lost its former richness. Every
body spoke of the rare sport there was to be. They said the theatre would
be crammed, because Frezzolini was going to sing. It was said she could
not sing well, now, but then the people liked to see her, anyhow. And so
we went. And every time the woman sang they hissed and laughed--the whole
magnificent house--and as soon as she left the stage they called her on
again with applause. Once or twice she was encored five and six times in
succession, and received with hisses when she appeared, and discharged
with hisses and laughter when she had finished--then instantly encored and
insulted again! And how the high-born knaves enjoyed it! White-kidded
gentlemen and ladies laughed till the tears came, and clapped their hands
in very ecstacy when that unhappy old woman would come meekly out for the
sixth time, with uncomplaining patience, to meet a storm of hisses! It was
the cruelest exhibition--the most wanton, the most unfeeling. The singer
would have conquered an audience of American rowdies by her brave,
unflinching tranquillity (for she answered encore after encore, and smiled
and bowed pleasantly, and sang the best she possibly could, and went
bowing off, through all the jeers and hisses, without ever losing
countenance or temper:) and surely in any other land than Italy her sex
and her helplessness must have been an ample protec-

<hr><i>Page 311</i><br>

tion to her--she could have needed no other. Think what a multitude of
small souls were crowded into that theatre last night. If the manager
could have filled his theatre with Neapolitan souls alone, without the
bodies, he could not have cleared less than ninety millions of dollars.
What traits of character must a man have to enable him to help three
thousand miscreants to hiss, and jeer, and laugh at one friendless old
woman, and shamefully humiliate her? He must have <i>all</i> the vile,
mean traits there are. My observation persuades me (I do not like to
venture beyond my own personal observation,) that the upper classes of
Naples possess those traits of character. Otherwise they may be very good
people; I can not say.

</p><p>In this city of Naples, they believe in and support one of the
wretchedest of all the religious impostures one can find in Italy--the
miraculous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius. Twice a year the
priests assemble all the people at the Cathedral, and get out this vial
of clotted blood and let them see it slowly dissolve and become
liquid--and every day for eight days, this dismal farce is repeated, while
the priests go among the crowd and collect money for the exhibition. The
first day, the blood liquefies in forty-seven minutes--the church is
crammed, then, and time must be allowed the collectors to get around:
after that it liquefies a little quicker and a little quicker, every day,
as the houses grow smaller, till on the eighth day, with only a few
dozens present to see the miracle, it liquefies in four minutes. 

</p><p>And here, also, they used to have a grand procession, of priests,
citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries of the City
Government, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up Madonna--a stuffed
and painted image, like a milliner's dummy--whose hair miraculously grew
and restored itself every twelve months. They still kept up this shaving
procession as late as four or five years ago. It was a source of great
profit to the church that possessed the remarkable effigy, and

<hr><i>Page 312</i><br>

the ceremony of the public barbering of her was always carried out with
the greatest possible eclat and display--the more the better, because the
more excitement there was about it the larger the crowds it drew and the
heavier the revenues it produced--but at last a day came when the Pope
and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and the City Government stopped
the Madonna's annual show. 

</p><p>There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans--two of the
silliest possible frauds, which half the population religiously and
faithfully believed, and the other half either believed also or else said
nothing about, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture.
I am very well satisfied to think the whole population believed in those
poor, cheap miracles--a people who want two cents every time they bow to
you, and who abuse a woman, are capable of it, I think. 

</p><p><center><font size=-1><b>ASCENT OF

</p><p>These Neapolitans always ask four times as much money as they
intend to take, but if you give them what they first demand, they feel
ashamed of themselves for aiming so low, and immediately ask more. When
money is to be paid and received, there is always some vehement jawing and
gesticulating about it. One can not buy and pay for two cents' worth of
clams without trouble and a quarrel. One "course," in a two-horse
carriage, costs a franc--that is law--but the hackman always demands
more, on some pretence or other, and if he gets it he makes a new demand.
It is said that a stranger took a one-horse carriage for a course--tariff,
half a franc. He gave the man five francs, by way of experiment. He
demanded more, and received another franc. Again he demanded more, and got
a franc--demanded more, and it was refused. He grew vehement--was again
refused, and became noisy. The stranger said, "Well, give me the seven
francs again, and I will see what I can do"--and when he got them, he
handed the hackman half a franc, and he immediately asked for two cents
to buy a drink with. It may be thought that I am preju-

<hr><i>Page 313</i><br>

diced. Perhaps I am. I would be ashamed of myself if I were not.

</p><p>Well, as I was saying, we got our mules and horses, after an hour
and a half of bargaining with the population of Annunciation, and started
sleepily up the mountain, with a vagrant at each mule's tail who pretended
to be driving the brute along, but was really holding on and getting
himself dragged up instead. I made slow headway at first, but I began to
get dissatisfied at the idea of paying my minion five francs to hold my

<hr><i>Page 314</i><br>

mule back by the tail and keep him from going up the hill, and so I
discharged him. I got along faster then. 

</p><p>We had one magnificent picture of Naples from a high point on the
mountain side. We saw nothing but the gas lamps, of course--two-thirds of
a circle, skirting the great Bay--a necklace of diamonds glinting up
through the darkness from the remote distance--less brilliant than the
stars overhead, but more softly, richly beautiful--and over all the great
city the lights crossed and recrossed each other in many and many a
sparkling line and curve. And back of the town, far around and abroad over
the miles of level campagna, were scattered rows, and circles, and
clusters of lights, all glowing like so many gems, and marking where a
score of villages were sleeping. About this time, the fellow who was
hanging on to the tail of the horse in front of me and practicing all
sorts of unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, got kicked some fourteen
rods, and this incident, together with the fairy spectacle of the lights
far in the distance, made me serenely happy, and I was glad I started to
Vesuvius.

or next day I will write it.
