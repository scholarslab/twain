CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3></center>

<hr><i>Page 390</i><br>
<p>WE anchored here at Yalta, Russia, two or three days ago. To me the 
place was a vision of the Sierras.  The tall, gray mountains that back 
it, their sides bristling with pines--cloven with ravines--here 
and there a hoary rock towering into view--long, straight streaks 
sweeping down from the summit to the sea, marking the passage of some 
avalanche of former times--all these were as like what one sees in 
the Sierras as if the one were a portrait of the other. The little 
village of Yalta nestles at the foot of an amphitheatre which slopes 
backward and upward to the wall of hills, and looks as if it might have 
sunk quietly down to its present position from a higher elevation. This 
depression is covered with the great parks and gardens of noblemen, and 
through the mass of green foliage the bright colors of their palaces bud 
out here and there like flowers. It is a beautiful spot.
</p><p>We had the United States Consul on board--the Odessa Consul. 
We assembled in the cabin and commanded him to tell us what we must do to 
be saved, and tell us quickly. He made a speech. The first thing he said 
fell like a blight on every hopeful spirit: he had never seen a court 
reception. (Three groans for the Consul.) But he said he had seen 
receptions at the Governor­General's in Odessa, and had often listened to 
people's experiences of receptions at the Russian and other courts, and 
believed he knew very well what sort of ordeal we were about to essay. 
(Hope budded again.) He said we were many; the summer­palace was 
small--a mere 
<hr><i>Page 391</i><br>
mansion; doubtless we should be received in summer fashion --in the 
garden; we would stand in a row, all the gentlemen in swallow­tail coats, 
white kids, and white neck­ties, and the ladies in light­colored silks, 
or something of that kind; at the proper moment--12 
meridian--the Emperor, attended by his suite arrayed in splendid 
uniforms, would appear and walk slowly along the line, bowing to some, 
and saying two or three words to others. At the moment his Majesty 
appeared, a universal, delighted, enthusiastic smile ought to break out 
like a rash among the passengers--a smile of love, of gratification, 
of admiration--and with one accord, the party must begin to 
bow--not obsequiously, but respectfully, and with dignity; at the 
end of fifteen minutes the Emperor would go in the house, and we could 
run along home again. We felt immensely relieved. It seemed, in a manner, 
easy. There was not a man in the party but believed that with a little 
practice he could stand in a row, especially if there were others along; 
there was not a man but believed he could bow without tripping on his 
coat tail and breaking his neck; in a word, we came to believe we were 
equal to any item in the performance except that complicated smile. The 
Consul also said we ought to draft a little address to the Emperor, and 
present it to one of his aides­de­camp, who would forward it to him at 
the proper time. Therefore, five gentlemen were appointed to prepare the 
document, and the fifty others went sadly smiling about the 
ship--practicing. During the next twelve hours we had the general 
appearance, somehow, of being at a funeral, where every body was sorry 
the death had occurred, but glad it was over--where every body was 
smiling, and yet broken-hearted.
</p><p>A committee went ashore to wait on his Excellency the 
Governor­General, and learn our fate. At the end of three hours of boding 
suspense, they came back and said the Emperor would receive us at noon 
the next day--would send carriages for us--would hear the 
address in person. The Grand Duke Michael had sent to invite us to his 
palace also. Any man could see that there was an intention here to show 
that Russia's 
<hr><i>Page 392</i><br>
friendship for America was so genuine as to render even her private 
citizens objects worthy of kindly attentions.
</p><p>At the appointed hour we drove out three miles, and assembled in 
the handsome garden in front of the Emperor's palace.
</p><p>We formed a circle under the trees before the door, for there was 
no one room in the house able to accommodate our three. score persons 
comfortably, and in a few minutes the imperial family came out bowing and 
smiling, and stood in our midst. A number of great dignitaries of the 
Empire, in undress unit forms, came with them. With every bow, his 
Majesty said a word of welcome. I copy these speeches. There is character 
in them--Russian character--which is politeness itself, and the 
genuine article. The French are polite, but it is often mere ceremonious 
politeness. A Russian imbues his polite things with a heartiness, both of 
phrase and expression, that compels 
<hr><i>Page 393</i><br>
belief in their sincerity. As I was saying, the Czar punctuated his 
speeches with bows:
</p><p>" Good morning--I am glad to see you--I am 
gratified--I am delighted--I am happy to receive you!"
</p><p>All took off their hats, and the Consul inflicted the address on 
him. He bore it with unflinching fortitude; then took the rusty­looking 
document and handed it to some great officer or other, to be filed away 
among the archives of Russia--in the stove. He thanked us for the 
address, and said he was very much pleased to see us, especially as such 
friendly relations existed between Russia and the United States. The 
Empress said the Americans were favorites in Russia, and she hoped the 
Russians were similarly regarded in America. These were all the speeches 
that were made, and I recommend them to parties who present policemen 
with gold watches, as models of brevity and point. After this the Empress 
went and talked sociably (for an Empress) with various ladies around the 
circle; several gentlemen entered into a disjointed general conversation 
with the Emperor; the Dukes and Princes, Admirals and Maids of Honor 
dropped into free-and­easy chat with first one and then another of our 
party, and whoever chose stepped forward and spoke with the modest little 
Grand Duchess Marie, the Czar's daughter. She is fourteen years old, 
light­haired, blue­eyed, unassuming and pretty. Every body talks English.

</p><p>The Emperor wore a cap, frock coat and pantaloons, all of some 
kind of plain white drilling--cotton or linen~and sported 
<hr><i>Page 394</i><br>
no jewelry or any insignia whatever of rank.  No costume could be less 
ostentatious. He is very tall and spare, and a determined­looking man, 
though a very pleasant­looking one nevertheless. It is easy to see that 
he is kind and affectionate There is something very noble in his 
expression when his cap is off. There is none of that cunning in his eye 
that all of us noticed in Louis Napoleon's.
</p><p>The Empress and the little Grand Duchess wore simple suits of 
foulard (or foulard silk, I don't know which is proper,) with a small 
blue spot in it; the dresses were trimmed with blue; both ladies wore 
broad blue sashes about their waists; linen collars and clerical ties of 
muslin; low­crowned straw­hats trimmed with blue velvet; parasols and 
flesh­colored gloves The Grand Duchess had no heels on her shoes. I do 
not know this of my own knowledge, but one of our ladies told me so. I 
was not looking at her shoes. I was glad to observe that she wore her own 
hair, plaited in thick braids against the back of her head, instead of 
the uncomely thing they call a waterfall, which is about as much like a 
waterfall as a canvas­covered ham is Like a cataract. Taking the kind 
expression that is in the Emperor's face and the gentleness that is in 
his young daughter's into consideration, I wondered if it would not tax 
the Czar's firmness to the utmost to condemn a supplicating wretch to 
misery in the wastes of Siberia if she pleaded for him. Every time their 
eyes met, I saw more and more what a tremendous power that weak, 
diffident school­girl could wield if she chose to do it. Many and many a 
time she might rule the Autocrat of Russia, whose lightest word is law to 
seventy millions of human beings  She was only a girl, and she looked 
like a thousand others I have seen, but never a girl provoked such a 
novel and peculiar interest in me before. A strange, new sensation is a 
rare thing in this hum­drum life, and I had it here. There was nothing 
stale or worn out about the thoughts and feelings the situation and the 
circumstances created. It seemed strange--stranger than I can 
tell--to think that the central figure in the cluster of men and 
women, chatting here under the trees like the most ordinary individual
<hr><i>Page 395</i><br>
in the land, was a man who could open his lips and ships would fly 
through the waves, locomotives would speed over the plains, couriers 
would hurry from village to village, a hundred telegraphs would flash the 
word to the four corners of an Empire that stretches its vast proportions 
over a seventh part of the habitable globe, and a countless multitude of 
men would spring to do his bidding. I had a sort of vague desire to 
examine his hands and see if they were of flesh and blood, like other 
men's. Here was a man who could do this wonderful thing, and yet if I 
chose I could knock him down. The case was plain, but it seemed 
preposterous, nevertheless--as preposterous as trying to knock down 
a mountain or wipe out a continent. If this man sprained his ankle, a 
million miles of telegraph would carry the news over 
mountains--valleys-- uninhabited deserts--under the 
trackless sea--and ten thousand newspapers would prate of it; if he 
were grievously ill, all the nations would know it before the sun rose 
again; if he dropped lifeless where he stood, his fall might shake the 
thrones of half a world ! If I could have stolen his coat, I would have 
done it. When I meet a man like that, I want something to remember him 
by.
</p><p>As a general thing, we have been shown through palaces by some 
plush­legged filagreed flunkey or other, who charged a franc for it; but 
after talking with the company half an hour, the Emperor of Russia and 
his family conducted us all through their mansion themselves. They made 
no charge. They seemed to take a real pleasure in it.
</p><p>We spent half an hour idling through the palace, admiring the cosy 
apartments and the rich but eminently home­like appointments of the 
place, and then the Imperial family bade our party a kind good­bye, and 
proceeded to count the spoons.
</p><p>An invitation was extended to us to visit the palace of the eldest 
son, the Crown Prince of Russia, which was near at hand. The young man 
was absent, but the Dukes and Countesses and Princes went over the 
premises with us as leisurely as was the case at the Emperor's, and 
conversation continued as lively as ever.
</p>
<hr><i>Page 396</i><br>
<p>It was a little after one o'clock, now. We drove to the Grand Duke 
Michael's, a mile away, in response to his invitation, previously given.
</p><p>We arrived in twenty minutes from the Emperor's. It is a lovely 
place. The beautiful palace nestles among the grand old groves of the 
park, the park sits in the lap of the picturesque crags and hills, and 
both look out upon the breezy ocean. In the park are rustic seats, here 
and there, in secluded nooks that are dark with shade; there are rivulets 
of crystal water; there are lakelets, with inviting, grassy banks;there 
are glimpses of sparkling cascades through openings in the wilderness of 
foliage; there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on the 
trunks of forest trees; there are miniature marble temples perched upon 
gray old crags; there are airy lookouts whence one may gaze upon a broad 
expanse of landscape and ocean. The palace is modeled after the choicest 
forms of Grecian architecture, and its wide colonnades surround a central 
court that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with their 
fragrance, and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summer 
air, and may possibly breed mosquitoes, but I do not think it does.
</p><p>The Grand Duke and his Duchess came out, and the presentation 
ceremonies were as simple as they had been at the Emperor's. In a few 
minutes, conversation was under way, as before. The Empress appeared in 
the verandah, and the little Grand Duchess came out into the crowd. They 
had beaten us there. In a few minutes, the Emperor came himself on 
horseback. It was very pleasant. You can appreciate it if you have ever 
visited royalty and felt occasionally that possibly you might be wearing 
out your welcome--though as a general thing, I believe, royalty is 
not scrupulous about discharging you when it is done with you.
</p><p>The Grand Duke is the third brother of the Emperor, is about 
thirty­seven years old, perhaps, and is the princeliest figure in Russia. 
He is even taller than the Czar, as straight as an Indian, and bears 
himself like one of those gorgeous knights we read about in romances of 
the Crusades. He looks 
<hr><i>Page 397</i><br>
like a great­hearted fellow who would pitch an enemy into the river in a 
moment, and then jump in and risk his life fishing him out again. The 
stories they tell of him show him to be of a brave and generous nature. 
He must have been desirous of proving that Americans were welcome guests 
in the imperial palaces of Russia, because he rode all the way to Yalta 
and escorted our procession to the Emperor¹s himself, and kept his aids 
scurrying about, clearing the road and offering assistance wherever it 
could be needed. We were rather familiar with him then, because we did 
not know who he was. We recognized him now, and appreciated the friendly 
spirit that prompted him to do us a favor that any other Grand Duke in 
the world would have doubtless declined to do. He had plenty of servitors 
whom he could have sent, but he chose to attend to the matter himself.
</p><p>The Grand Duke was dressed in the handsome and showy uniform of a 
Cossack officer. The Grand Duchess had on a white alpaca robe, with the 
seams and gores trimmed with black barb lace, and a little gray hat with 
a feather of the same color. She is young, rather pretty modest and 
unpretending, and full of winning politeness.
</p><p>Our party walked all through the house, and then the nobility 
escorted them all over the grounds, and finally brought them back to the 
palace about half­past two o'clock to breakfast. They called it 
breakfast, but we would have called it luncheon. It consisted of two 
kinds of wine; tea, bread, cheese, and cold meats, and was served on the 
centre­tables in the reception room and the verandahs--anywhere that 
was convenient; there was no ceremony. It was a sort of picnic. I had 
heard before that we were to breakfast there, but Blucher said he 
believed Baker's boy had suggested it to his Imperial Highness. I think 
not--though it would be like him. Baker's boy is the famine­breeder 
of the ship. He is always hungry. They say he goes about the state­rooms 
when the passengers are out, and eats up all the soap. And they say he 
eats oakum. They say he will eat any thing he can get between meals, but 
he prefers oakum. He does not like oakum for 
<hr><i>Page 398</i><br>
dinner, but he likes it for a lunch, at odd hours, or any thing that way. 
It makes him very disagreeable, because it makes his breath bad, and 
keeps his teeth all stuck up with tar. Baker's boy may have suggested the 
breakfast, but I hope he did not. It went off well, anyhow. The 
illustrious host moved about from place to place, and helped to destroy 
the provisions and keep the conversation lively, and the Grand Duchess 
talked with the verandah parties and such as had satisfied their 
appetites and straggled out from the reception room.
</p><p>The Grand Duke's tea was delicious. They give one a lemon to 
squeeze into it, or iced milk, if he prefers it. The former is best. This 
tea is brought overland from China. It injures the article to transport 
it by sea.
</p><p>When it was time to go, we bade our distinguished hosts good­bye, 
and they retired happy and contented to their apartments to count their 
spoons.
</p><p>We had spent the best part of half a day in the home of royalty, 
and had been as cheerful and comfortable all the time as we could have 
been in the ship. I would as soon have thought of being cheerful in 
Abraham's bosom as in the palace of an Emperor. I supposed that Emperors 
were terrible people. I thought they never did any thing but wear 
magnificent crowns and red velvet dressing­gowns with dabs of wool sewed 
on them in spots, and sit on thrones and scowl at the flunkies and the 
people in the parquette, and order Dukes and Duchesses off to execution. 
I find, however, that when one is so fortunate as to get behind the 
scenes and see them at home and in the privacy of their firesides, they 
are strangely like common mortals. They are pleasanter to look upon then 
than they are in their theatrical aspect. It seems to come as natural to 
them to dress and act like other people as it is to put a friend's cedar 
pencil in your pocket when you are done using it. But I can never have 
any confidence in the tinsel kings of the theatre after this. It will be 
a great loss. I used to take such a thrilling pleasure in them. But, 
hereafter, I will turn me sadly away and say; 
</p>
<hr><i>Page 399</i><br>
<p>²This does not answer--this isn¹t the style of king that <i>I</i> 
am acquainted with.²
</p><p>When they swagger around the stage in jeweled crowns and splendid 
robes, I shall feel bound to observe that all the Emperors that ever I 
was personally acquainted with wore the commonest sort of clothes, and 
did not swagger. And when they come on the stage attended by a vast 
body­guard of supes in helmets and tin breastplates, it will be my duty 
as well as my pleasure to inform the ignorant that no crowned head of my 
acquaintance has a soldier any where about his house or his person.
</p><p>Possibly it may be thought that our party tarried too long, or did 
other improper things, but such was not the case. The company felt that 
they were occupying an unusually responsible position--they were 
representing the people of America, not the Government--and 
therefore they were careful to do their best to perform their high 
mission with credit.
</p><p>On the other hand, the Imperial families, no doubt, considered 
<hr><i>Page 400</i><br>
that in entertaining us they were more especially entertaining the people 
of America than they could by showering attentions on a whole platoon of 
ministers plenipotentiary and therefore they gave to the event its 
fullest significance, as an expression of good will and friendly feeling 
toward the entire country. We took the kindnesses we received as 
attentions thus directed, of course, and not to ourselves as a party. 
That we felt a personal pride in being received as the representatives of 
a nation, we do not deny; that we felt a national pride in the warm 
cordiality of that reception, can not be doubted.
</p><p>Our poet has been rigidly suppressed, from the time we let go the 
anchor. When it was announced that we were going to visit the Emperor of 
Russia, the fountains of his great deep were broken up, and he rained 
ineffable bosh for four­and-twenty hours. Our original anxiety as to what 
we were going to do with ourselves, was suddenly transformed into anxiety 
about what we were going to do with our poet. The problem was solved at 
last. Two alternatives were offered him--he must either swear a 
dreadful oath that he would not issue a line of his poetry while he was 
in the Czar's dominions, or else remain under guard on board the ship 
until we were safe at Constantinople again. He fought the dilemma long, 
but yielded at last. It was a great deliverance. Perhaps the savage 
reader would like a specimen of his style. I do not mean this term to be 
offensive. I only use it because " the gentle reader" has been used so 
often that any change from it can not but be refreshing:
<blockquote><font size="-1">
<l>"Save us and sanctify us, and finally, then, </l><br>
<l>See good provisions we enjoy while we journey to Jerusalem. </l><br>
<l>For so man proposes, which it is most true</l><br>
<l>And time will wait for none, nor for us too."</l><br>
</font></blockquote>
</p><p>The sea has been unusually rough all day. However, we have had a 
lively time of it, anyhow. We have had quite a run of visitors. The 
Governor­General came, and we received him with a salute of nine guns. He 
brought his family with him. I observed that carpets were spread from the 
pier­head 
<hr><i>Page 401</i><br>
to his carriage for him to walk on, though I have seen him walk there 
without any carpet when he was not on business. I thought may be he had 
what the accidental insurance people might call an extra­hazardous polish 
("policy" joke, but not above mediocrity,) on his boots, and wished to 
protect them, but I examined and could not see that they were blacked any 
better than usual. It may have been that he had forgotten his carpet, 
before, but he did not have it with him, anyhow. He was an exceedingly 
pleasant old gentleman; we all liked him, especially Blucher. When he 
went away, Blucher invited him to come again and fetch his carpet along.
</p><p>Prince Dolgorouki and a Grand Admiral or two, whom we had seen 
yesterday at the reception, came on board also. I was a little distant 
with these parties, at first, because when I have been visiting Emperors 
I do not like to be too familiar with people I only know by reputation, 
and whose moral characters and standing in society I can not be 
thoroughly acquainted with. I judged it best to be a little offish, at 
first.  I said to myself, Princes and Counts and Grand Admirals are very 
well, but they are not Emperors, and one can not be too particular about 
who he associates with.
</p><p>Baron Wrangel came, also. He used to be Russian Ambassador at 
Washington. I told him I had an uncle who fell down a shaft and broke 
himself in two, as much as a year before that. That was a falsehood, but 
then I was not going to let any man eclipse me on surprising adventures, 
merely for the want of a little invention. The Baron is a fine man, and 
is said to stand high in the Emperor's confidence and esteem.
</p><p>Baron Ungern­Sternberg, a boisterous, whole­souled old nobleman, 
came with the rest. He is a man of progress and enterprise--a 
representative man of the age. He is the Chief Director of the railway 
system of Russia--a sort of railroad king. In his line he is making 
things move along in this country He has traveled extensively in America. 
He says he has tried convict labor on his railroads, and with perfect 
success. He says the convict" work well, and are quiet and peaceable.  He 
observed that he employs nearly ten thousand of them now.  
<hr><i>Page 402</i><br>
This appeared to be another call on my resources. I was equal to the 
emergency. I said we had eighty thousand convicts employed on the 
railways in America--all of them under sentence of death for murder 
in the first degree. That closed him out.
</p><p>We had General Todtleben (the famous defender of Sebastopol, 
during the siege,) and many inferior army and also navy officers, and a 
number of unofficial Russian ladies and gentlemen. Naturally, a champagne 
luncheon was in order, and was accomplished without loss of life. Toasts 
and jokes were discharged freely, but no speeches were made save one 
thanking the Emperor and the Grand Duke, through the Governor-General, 
for our hospitable reception, and one by the Governor­General in reply, 
in which he returned the Emperor's thanks for the speech, etc., etc.
