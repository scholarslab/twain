<h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER L.</h3>

<hr><i>Page 525</i><br>

<p>We descended from Mount Tabor, crossed a deep ravine, followed a
hilly, rocky road to Nazareth -- distant two hours. All distances in the
East are measured by hours, not miles. A good horse will walk three miles
an hour over nearly any kind of a road ; therefore, an hour, here, always
stands for three miles. This method of computation is bothersome and
annoying ; and until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it, it carries no
intelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the pagan
hours into christian miles, just as people do with the spoken words of a
foreign language they are acquainted with, but not familiarly enough to
catch the meaning in a moment. Distances traveled by human feet are also
estimated by hours and minutes, though I do not know what the base of the
calculation is. In Constantinople you ask, " How far is it to the
Consulate ?" and they answer, " About ten minutes." " How far is it to
the Lloyds' Agency'" " Quarter of an hour." " How far is it to the lower
bridge ?" " Four minutes." I can not be positive about it, but I think
that there, when a man orders a pair of pantaloons, he says he wants them
a quarter of a minute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist.

</p><p>Two hours from Tabor to Nazareth -- and as it was an uncommonly
narrow, crooked trail, we necessarily met all the camel trains and
jackass caravans between Jericho and Jacksonville in that particular
place and nowhere else. The donkeys do not matter so much, because they
are so small that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal of
spirit,


<hr><i>Page 526 </i><br>

but a camel is not jumpable. A camel is as tall as any ordinary
dwelling�house in Syria -- which is to say a camel is from one to two,
and sometimes nearly three feet taller than a good-sized man. In this
part of the country his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacks
-- one on each side. He and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage.
Think of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail. The camel
would not turn out for a king. He stalks serenely along, bringing his
cushioned stilts forward with the long, regular swing of a pendulum, and
whatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably, or be wiped out
forcibly by the bulky sacks. It was a tiresome ride to us, and perfectly
exhausting to the horses. We were compelled to jump over upwards of
eighteen hundred donkeys, and only one person in the party was unseated
less than sixty times by the camels. This seems like a powerful
statement, but the poet has said, " Things are not what they seem." I can
not think of any thing, now, more certain to make one shudder, than to
have a soft�footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear
with its cold, flabby under�lip. A camel did this for one of the boys,
who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study. He glanced up and saw
the majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to
get out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulder
before he accomplished it. This was the only pleasant incident of the
journey.

</p><p>At Nazareth we camped in an olive grove near the Virgin Mary's
fountain, and that wonderful Arab  "guard" came to collect some
bucksheesh for his "services" in following us from Tiberias and warding
off invisible dangers with the terrors of his armament. The dragoman had
paid his master, but that counted as nothing -- if you hire a man to
sneeze for you, here, and another man chooses to help him, you have got
to pay both. They do nothing whatever without pay. How it must have
surprised these people to hear the way of salvation offered to them "
<i>without money and without price.</i>" If the manners, the people or
the customs of this country have changed since

<hr><i>Page 527 </i><br>
the Saviour's time, the figures and metaphors of the Bible are not the
evidences to prove it by.

</p><p>We entered the great Latin Convent which is built over the
traditional dwelling�place of the Holy Family. We went down a flight of
fifteen steps below the ground level, and stood in a small chapel tricked
out with tapestry hangings, silver lamps, and oil paintings. A spot
marked by a cross, in the marble floor, under the altar, was exhibited as
the place made forever holy by the feet of the Virgin when she stood up
to receive the message of the angel. So simple, so unpretending a
locality, to be the scene of so mighty an event ! The very scene of the
Annunciation -- an event which has been commemorated by splendid shrines
and august temples all over the civilized world, and one which the
princes of art have made it their loftiest ambition to picture worthily
on their canvas ; a spot whose history is familiar to the very children
of every house, and city, and obscure hamlet of the furthest lands of
Christendom ; a spot which myriads of men would toil across the breadth
of a world to see, would consider it a priceless privilege to look upon.
It was easy to think these thoughts. But it was not easy to bring myself
up to the magnitude of the situation. I could sit off several thousand
miles and imagine the angel appearing, with shadowy wings and lustrous
countenance, and note the glory that streamed downward upon the Virgin's
head while the message from the Throne of God fell upon her ears -- any
one can do that, beyond the ocean, but few can do it here. I saw the
little recess from which the angel stepped, but could not fill its void.
The angels that I know are creatures of unstable fancy -- they will not
fit in niches of substantial stone. Imagination labors best in distant
fields. I doubt if any man can stand in the Grotto of the Annunciation
and people with the phantom images of his mind its too tangible walls of
stone.

</p><p>They showed us a broken granite pillar, depending from the roof,
which they said was hacked in two by the Moslem conquerors of Nazareth,
in the vain hope of pulling down the sanctuary. But the pillar remained
miraculously suspended

<hr><i>Page 528 </i><br>

in the air, and, unsupported itself, supported then and still supports
the roof. By dividing this statement up among eight, it was found not
difficult to believe it.

</p><p>These gifted Latin monks never do any thing by halves. If they
were to show you the Brazen Serpent that was elevated in the wilderness,
you could depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated
on also, and even the hole it stood in. They have got the "Grotto " of
the Annunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one's throat is to
his mouth, they have also the Virgin's Kitchen, and even her
sitting�room, where she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with
Hebrew toys eighteen hundred years ago.  All under one roof, and all
clean, spacious, comfortable "grottoes." It seems curious that personages
intimately connected with the Holy Family always lived in grottoes -- in
Nazareth, in Bethlehem, in imperial Ephesus -- and yet nobody else in
their day and generation thought of doing any thing of the kind. If they
ever did, their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to wonder
at the peculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of When the
Virgin fled from Herod's wrath, she hid in a grotto in Bethlehem, and the
same is there to this day. The slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem
was done in a grotto ; the Saviour was born in a grotto -- both are shown
to pilgrims yet. It is exceedingly strange that these tremendous events
all happened in grottoes -- and exceedingly fortunate, likewise, because
the strongest houses must crumble to ruin in time, but a grotto in the
diving rock will last forever. It is an imposture -- this grotto stuff --
but it is one that all men ought to thank the Catholics for.  Wherever
they ferret out a lost locality made holy by some Scriptural event, they
straightway build a massive -- almost imperishable -- church there, and
preserve the memory of that locality for the gratification of future
generations. If it had been left to Protestants to do this most worthy
work, we would not even know where Jerusalem is to�day, and the man who
could go and put his finger on Nazareth would be too wise for this world.
The world owes the Catholics its good will even for the happy rascality

<hr><i>Page 529 </i><br>

of hewing out these bogus grottoes in the rock ; for it is infinitely
more satisfactory to look at a grotto, where people have faithfully
believed for centuries that the Virgin once lived, than to have to
imagine a dwelling�place for her somewhere, any where, nowhere, loose and
at large all over this town of Nazareth. There is too large a scope of
country. The imagination can not work. There is no one particular spot to
chain your eye, rivet your interest, and make you think. The memory of
the Pilgrims can not perish while Plymouth Rock remains to us. The old
monks are wise. They know how to drive a stake through a pleasant
tradition that will hold it to its place forever.

</p><p>We visited the places where Jesus worked for fifteen years as a
carpenter, and where he attempted to teach in the synagogue and was
driven out by a mob. Catholic chapels stand upon these sites and protect
the little fragments of the ancient walls which remain. Our pilgrims
broke off specimens. We visited, also, a new chapel, in the midst of the
town, which is built around a boulder some twelve feet long by four feet
thick ; the priests discovered, a few years ago, that the disciples had
sat upon this rock to rest, once, when they had walked up from Capernaum.
They hastened to preserve the relic. Relics are very good property.
Travelers are expected to pay for seeing them, and they do it cheerfully.
We like the idea. One's conscience can never be the worse for the
knowledge that he has paid his way like a man. Our pilgrims would have
liked very well to get out their lampblack and stencil�plates and paint
their names on that rock, together with the names of the villages they
hail from in America, but the priests permit nothing of that kind. To
speak the strict truth, however, our party seldom offend in that way,
though we have men in the ship who never lose an opportunity to do it.
Our pilgrims' chief sin is their lust for "specimens." I suppose that by
this time they know the dimensions of that rock to an inch, and its
weight to a ton ; and I do not hesitate to charge that they will go back
there to�night and try to carry it off.

</p><p>This "Fountain of the Virgin " is the one which tradition

<hr><i>Page 530 </i><br>

says Mary used to get water from, twenty times a day, when she was a
girl, and bear it away in a jar upon her head. The water streams through
faucets in the face of a wall of ancient masonry which stands removed
from the houses of the village. The young girls of Nazareth still collect
about it by the dozen and keep up a riotous laughter and sky�larking. The
Nazarene girls are homely. Some of them have large, lustrous eyes, but
none of them have pretty faces. These girls wear a single garment,
usually, and it is loose, shapeless, of undecided color ; it is generally
out of repair, too. They wear, from crown to jaw, curious strings of old
coins, after the manner of the belles of Tiberias, and brass jewelry upon
their wrists and in their ears. They wear no shoes and stockings. They
are the most human girls we have found in the country yet, and the best
natured. But there is no question that these picturesque maidens sadly
lack comeliness.

<hr><i>Page 531 </i><br>

</p><p>A pilgrim -- the "Enthusiast " -- said: "See that tall, graceful
girl! look at the Madonna�like beauty of her countenance !"

</p><p>Another pilgrim came along presently and said: "Observe that tall,
graceful girl ; what queenly Madonna�like gracefulness of beauty is in
her countenance."

</p><p>I said: "She is not tall, she is short ; she is not beautiful, she
is homely ; she is	 graceful
enough, I grant, but she is rather boisterous."

</p><p>The third and last pilgrim moved by, before long, and he said:
"Ah, what a tall, graceful girl ! what Madonna-like gracefulness of
queenly beauty!"

</p><p>The verdicts were all in. It was time, now, to look up the
authorities for all these opinions. I found this paragraph, which
follows. Written by whom ? Wm. C. Grimes:

<blockquote><font size="-1">"After we were in the saddle, we rode down to
the spring to have a last look at the women of Nazareth, who were, as a
class, much the prettiest that we had seen in the East. As we approached
the crowd a tall girl of nineteen advanced toward

<hr><i>Page 532 </i><br>

Miriam and offered her a cup of water. Her movement was graceful and
queenly.  We exclaimed on the spot at the Madonna-like beauty of her
countenance. Whitely was suddenly thirsty, and begged for water, and
drank it slowly, with his eyes over the top of the cup, fixed on her
large black eyes, which gazed on him quite as curiously as he on her.
Then Moreright wanted water. She gave it to him and he managed to spill
it so as to ask for another cup, and by the time she came to me she saw
through the operation ; her eyes were full of fun as she looked at me. I
laughed outright, and she joined me in as gay a shout as ever country
maiden in old Orange county. I wished for a picture of her. A Madonna,
whose face was a portrait of that beautiful Nazareth girt would be a
'thing of beauty' and 'a joy forever.'"</font></blockquote>

</p><p>That is the kind of gruel which has been served out from Palestine
for ages. Commend me to Fennimore Cooper to find beauty in the Indians,
and to Grimes to find it in the Arabs. Arab men are often fine looking,
but Arab women are not. We can all believe that the Virgin Mary was
beautiful ; it is not natural to think otherwise ; but does it follow
that it is our duty to find beauty in these present women of Nazareth ?

</p><p>I love to quote from Grimes, because he is so dramatic. And
because he is so romantic. And because he seems to care but little
whether he tells the truth or not, so he scares the reader or excites his
envy or his admiration.

</p><p>He went through this peaceful land with one hand forever on his
revolver, and the other on his pocket�handkerchief.  Always, when he was
not on the point of crying over a holy place, he was on the point of
killing an Arab. More surprising things happened to him in Palestine than
ever happened to any traveler here or elsewhere since Munchausen died.

</p><p>At Beitin, where nobody had interfered with him, he crept out of
his tent at dead of night and shot at what he took to be an Arab lying on
a rock, some distance away, planning evil. The ball killed a wolf. Just
before he fired, he makes a dramatic picture of himself -- as usual, to
scare the reader:

<blockquote><font size="-1">"Was it imagination, or did I see a moving
object on the surface of the rock? If it were a man, why did he not now
drop me ? He had a beautiful shot as I stood out in my black boornoose
against the white tent. I had the sensation of an entering bullet in my
throat, breast, brain."</font></blockquote>

</p><p>Reckless creature !

638

</p><p>Riding toward Genessaret, they saw two Bedouins, and " we looked
to our pistols and loosened them quietly in our shawls," etc. Always
cool.

</p><p>In Samaria, he charged up a hill, in the face of a volley of
stones ; he fired into the crowd of men who threw them. He says:

"<blockquote><font size="-1">I never lost an opportunity of impressing
the Arabs with the perfection of American and English weapons, and the
danger of attacking any one of the armed Franks. I think the lesson of
that ball not lost."
</font></blockquote>

</p><p>At Beitin he gave his whole band of Arab muleteers a piece of his
mind, and then --

<blockquote><font size="-1">" I contented myself with a solemn assurance
that if there occurred another instance of disobedience to orders I would
thrash the responsible party as he never dreamed of being thrashed, and
if I could not find who was responsible, I would whip them all, from
first to last, whether there was a governor at hand to do it or I had to
do it myself "</font></blockquote>

</p><p>Perfectly fearless, this man.

</p><p>He rode down the perpendicular path in the rocks, from the

<hr><i>Page 534 </i><br>

Castle of Banias to the oak grove, at a flying gallop, his horse striding
"thirty feet " at every bound. I stand prepared to bring thirty reliable
witnesses to prove that Putnam's famous feat at Horseneck was
insignificant compared to this.

</p><p>Behold him -- always theatrical -- looking at Jerusalem -- this
time, by an oversight, with his hand off his pistol for once.

<blockquote><font size="-1">"I stood in the road, my hand on my horse's
neck, and with my dim eyes sought to trace the outlines of the holy
places which I had long before fixed in my mind, but the fast�flowing
tears forbade my succeeding. There were our Mohammedan servants, a Latin
monk, two Armenians and a Jew in our cortege, and all alike gazed with
overflowing eyes."</font></blockquote>

</p><p>If Latin monks and Arabs cried, I know to a moral certainty that
the horses cried also, and so the picture is complete.

</p><p>But when necessity demanded, he could be firm as adamant. In the
Lebanon Valley an Arab youth -- a Christian; he is particular to explain
that Mohammedans do not steal -- robbed him of a paltry ten dollars'
worth of powder and shot. He convicted him before a sheik and looked on
while he was punished  by the terrible bastinado. Hear him:

<blockquote><font size="-1">" He (Mousa) was on his back in a twinkling,
howling, shouting, screaming, but he was carried out to the piazza before
the door, where we could see the operation, and laid face down. One man
sat on his back and one on his legs, the latter holding up his feet,
while a third laid on the bare soles a rhinoceros�hide koorbash* that
whizzed through the air at every stroke. Poor Moreright was in agony, and
Nama and Nama the Second (mother and sister of Mousa,) were on their
faces begging and wailing, now embracing my knees and now Whitely's,
while the brother, outside, made the air ring with cries louder than
Mousa's. Even Yusef came and asked me on his knees to relent, and last of
all, Betuni -- the rascal had lost a feedbag in their house and had been
loudest in his denunciations that morning -- besought the Howajji to have
mercy on the fellow."</font></blockquote>

</p><p>But not he! The punishment was "suspended," at the <i>fifteenth
blow</i> to hear the confession. Then Grimes and his party rode away, and
left the entire Christian family to be fined and as severely punished as
the <i>Mohammedan sheik</i> should deem proper.

</p><p><font size="-2">"A Koorbash is Arabic for cowhide, the cow being a
rhinoceros.  It is the most cruel whip known to fame.  Heavy as lead, and
flexible as India-rubber, usually about forty inches long and tapering
gradually from an inch in diameter to a point, it administers a blow
which <i>leaves its mark for time.</i>" -- <i>Scow Life in Egypt</i>, by
the same author.</font>

<hr><i>Page 535 </i><br>

</p><p><blockquote><font size="-1">" As I mounted, Yusef once more begged
me to interfere and have mercy on them, but I looked around at the dark
faces of the crowd, and I couldn't find one drop of pity in my heart for
them."</font></blockquote>

</p><p>He closes his picture with a rollicking burst of humor which
contrasts finely with the grief of the mother and her children.

</p><p>One more paragraph:

<blockquote><font size="-1">"Then once more I bowed my head. It is no
shame to have wept in Palestine. I wept, when I saw Jerusalem, I wept
when I lay in the starlight at Bethlehem. I wept on the blessed shores of
Galilee. My hand was no less firm on the rein, my anger did not tremble
on the trigger of my pistol when I rode with it in my right hand along
the shore of the blue sea" (weeping.) "My eye was not dimmed by those
tears nor my heart in aught weakened. Let him who would sneer at my
emotion close this volume here, for he will find little to his taste in
my journeyings through Holy Land."</font></blockquote>

</p><p>He never bored but he struck water.

<hr><i>Page 536 </i><br>

</p><p>I am aware that this is a pretty voluminous notice of Mr. Grimes'
book. However, it is proper and legitimate to speak of it, for "Nomadic
Life in Palestine" is a representative book  -- the representative of a
<i>class</i> of Palestine books -- and a criticism upon it will serve for
a criticism upon them all. And since I am treating it in the
comprehensive capacity of a representative book, I have taken the liberty
of giving to both book and author fictitious names. Perhaps it is in
better taste, any how, to do this.</p>
