    <b><font size="-1">THE BURIED CITY OF POMPEII.</font></b>
  </center>

  <p>THEY pronounce it Pom-<i>pay</i>-e. I always had an idea that
  you went down into Pompeii with torches, by the way of damp, dark
  stairways, just as you do in silver mines, and traversed gloomy
  tunnels with lava overhead and something on either hand like
  dilapidated prisons gouged out of the solid earth, that faintly
  resembled houses. But you do nothing the kind. Fully one-half of
  the buried city, perhaps, is completely exhumed and thrown open
  freely to the light of day; and there stand the long rows of
  solidly-built brick houses (roofless) just as they stood eighteen
  hundred years ago, hot with the flaming sun; and there lie their
  floors, clean- wept, and not a bright fragment tarnished or
  waiting of the labored mosaics that pictured them with the
  beasts, and birds, and flowers which we copy in perishable
  carpets to-day; and here are the Venuses, and Bacchuses, and
  Adonises, making love and getting drunk in many-hued frescoes on
  the walls of saloon and bed-chamber; and there are the narrow
  streets and narrower sidewalks, pa,ed with flags of good bard
  lava, the ne deeply rutted with the chariot-wheels, and the other
  with the passing feet of the Pompeiians of by-gone centuries; and
  there are the bake-shops, the temples, the halls of justice, the
  bath,s, the theatres--all clean-scraped and neat, and suggesting
  nothing of the nature of a silver mine away down in the bowels of
  the earth. The broken pillars lying about, the doorless doorways
  and the crumbled tops of the wilderness of walls,</p>
  <hr />
  <i>Page 328</i><br />
  were wonderfully suggestive of the "burnt district" in one of our
  cities, and if there had been any charred timbers, shattered
  windows, heaps of debris, and general blackness and smokiness
  about the place, the resemblance would have been perfect. But
  no--the sun shines as brightly down on old Pompeii to-day as it
  did when Christ was born in Bethlehem, and its streets are
  cleaner a hundred times than ever Pompeiian saw them in her
  prime. I know whereof I speak--for in the great, chief
  thoroughfares (Merchant street and the Street of Fortune) have I
  not seen with my own eyes how for two hundred years at least the
  pavements were not repaired!--bow ruts five and even ten inches
  deep were worn into the thick flagstones by the chariot-wheels of
  generations of swindled tax- payers? And do I not know by these
  signs that Street Commissioners of Pompeii never attended to
  their business, and that if they never mended the pavements they
  never cleaned them? And, besides, is it not the inborn nature of
  Street Commis-
  <hr />
  <i>Page 329</i><br />
  sioners to avoid their duty whenever they get a chance? I wish I
  knew the name of the last one that held office in Pompeii so that
  I could give him a blast. I speak with feeling on this subject,
  because I caught my foot in one of those ruts, and the sadness
  that came over me when I saw the first poor skeleton, with ashes
  and lava sticking to it, was tempered by the reflection that may
  be that party was the Street Commissioner.

  <p>No--Pompeii is no longer a buried city. It is a city of
  hundreds and hundreds of roofless houses, and a tangled maze of
  streets where one could easily get lost, without a guide, and
  have to sleep in some ghostly palace that had known no living
  tenant since that awful November night of eighteen centuries
  ago.</p>

  <p>We passed through the gate which faces the Mediterranean,
  (called the "Marine Gate,") and by the rusty, broken image of
  Minerva, still keeping tireless watch and ward over the
  possessions it was powerless to save, and went up a long street
  and stood in the broad court of the Forum of Justice. The floor
  was level and clean, and up and down either side was a noble
  colonnade of broken pillars, with their beautiful Ionic and
  Corinthian columns scattered about them. At the upper end were
  the vacant seats of the Judges, and behind them we descended into
  a dungeon where the ashes and cinders had found two prisoners
  chained on that memorable November night, and tortured them to
  death. How they must have tugged at the pitiless fetters as the
  fierce fires surged around them!</p>

  <p>Then we lounged through many and many a sumptuous private
  mansion which we could not have entered without a formal
  invitation in incomprehensible Latin, in the olden time, when the
  owners lived there-- and we probably wouldn't have got it. These
  people built their houses a good deal alike. The floors were laid
  in fanciful figures wrought in mosaics of many-colored marbles.
  At the threshold your eyes fall upon a Latin sentence of welcome,
  sometimes, or a picture of a dog, with the legend "Beware of the
  Dog," and sometimes a pic-</p>
  <hr />
  <i>Page 330</i><br />
  ture of a bear or a faun with no inscription at all. Then you
  enter a sort of vestibule, where they used to keep the hat-rack,
  I suppose; next a room with a large marble basin in the midst and
  the pipes of a fountain; on either side are bedrooms; beyond the
  fountain is a reception-room, then a little garden, dining-room,
  and so forth and so on. The floors were all mosaic, the walls
  were stuccoed, or frescoed, or ornamented with bas- reliefs, and
  here and there were statues, large and small, and little fish-
  pools, and cascades of sparkling water that sprang from secret
  places in the colonnade of handsome pillars that surrounded the
  court, and kept the flower-beds fresh and the air cool. Those
  Pompeiians were very luxurious in their tastes and habits. The
  most exquisite bronzes we have seen in Europe, came from the
  exhumed cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and also the finest
  cameos and the most delicate engravings on precious stones; their
  pictures, eighteen or nineteen centuries old, are often much more
  pleasing than the cel-
  <hr />
  <i>Page 331</i><br />
  ebrated rubbish of the old masters of three centuries ago. They
  were well up in art. From the creation of these works of the
  first, clear up to the eleventh century, art seems hardly to have
  existed at all--at least no remnants of it are left--and it was
  curious to see how far (in some things, at any rate,) these old
  time pagans excelled the remote generations of masters that came
  after them. The pride of the world in sculptures seem to be the
  Laocoon and the Dying Gladiator, in Rome. They are as old as
  Pompeii, were dug from the earth like Pompeii; but their exact
  age or who made them can only be conjectured. But worn, and
  cracked, without a history, and with the blemishing stains of
  numberless centuries upon them, they still mutely mock at all
  efforts to rival their perfections.

  <p>It was a quaint and curious pastime, wandering through this
  old silent city of the dead--lounging through utterly deserted
  streets where thousands and thousands of human beings once bought
  and sold, and walked and rode, and made the place resound with
  the noise and confusion of traffic and pleasure. They were not
  lazy. They hurried in those days. We had evidence of that. There
  was a temple on one corner, and it was a shorter cut to go
  between the columns of that temple from one street to the other
  than to go around--and behold that pathway had been worn deep
  into the heavy flagstone floor of the building by generations of
  time- saving feet! They would not go around when it was quicker
  to go through. We do that way in our cities.</p>

  <p>Every where, you see things that make you wonder how old these
  old houses were before the night of destruction came--things,
  too, which bring back those long dead inhabitants and place the
  living before your eyes. For instance: The steps (two feet
  thick--lava blocks) that lead up out of the school, and the same
  kind of steps that lead up into the dress circle of the principal
  theatre, are almost worn through! For ages the boys hurried out
  of that school, and for ages their parents hurried into that
  theatre, and the nervous feet that have been dust and ashes for
  eighteen centuries have left their record for</p>
  <hr />
  <i>Page 332</i><br />
  us to read to-day. I imagined I could see crowds of gentlemen and
  ladies thronging into the theatre, with tickets for secured seats
  in their hands, and on the wall, I read the imaginary placard, in
  infamous grammar, "POSITIVELY NO FREE LIST, EXCEPT MEMBERS OF THE
  PRESS!" Hanging about the doorway (I fancied,) were slouchy
  Pompeiian street-boys uttering slang and profanity, and keeping a
  wary eye out for checks. I entered the theatre, and sat down in
  one of the long rows of stone benches in the dress circle, and
  looked at the place for the orchestra, and the ruined stage, and
  around at the wide sweep of empty boxes, and thought to myself,
  "This house won't pay." I tried to imagine the music in full
  blast, the leader of the orchestra beating time, and the
  "versatile" So-and-So (who had "just returned from a most
  successful tour in the provinces to play his last and farewell
  engagement of positively six nights only, in Pompeii, previous to
  his departure for Herculaneum,") charging around the stage and
  piling the agony mountains high--but I could not do it with such
  a "house" as that; those empty benches tied my fancy down to dull
  reality. I said, these people that ought to be here have been
  dead, and still, and moldering to dust for ages and ages, and
  will never care for the trifles and follies of life any more for
  ever--"Owing to circumstances, etc., etc., there will not be any
  performance to-night." Close down the curtain. Put out the
  lights.

  <p>And so I turned away and went through shop after shop and
  store after store, far down the long street of the merchants, and
  called for the wares of Rome and the East, but the tradesmen were
  gone, the marts were silent, and nothing was left but the broken
  jars all set in cement of cinders and ashes: the wine and the oil
  that once had filled them were gone with their owners.</p>

  <p>In a bake-shop was a mill for grinding the grain, and the
  furnaces for baking the bread: and they say that here, in the
  same furnaces, the exhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked
  loaves which the baker had not found time to remove from the
  ovens the last time he left his shop, because circumstances
  compelled him to leave in such a hurry.</p>
  <hr />
  <i>Page 333</i><br />

  <p>In one house (the only building in Pompeii which no woman is
  now allowed to enter,) were the small rooms and short beds of
  solid masonry, just as they were in the old times, and on the
  walls were pictures which looked almost as fresh as if they were
  painted yesterday, but which no pen could have the hardihood to
  describe; and here and there were Latin inscriptions--obscene
  scintillations of wit, scratched by hands that possibly were
  uplifted to Heaven for succor in the midst of a driving storm of
  fire before the night was done.</p>

  <p>In one of the principal streets was a ponderous stone tank,
  and a water-spout that supplied it, and where the tired, heated
  toilers from the Campagna used to rest their right hands when
  they bent over to put their lips to the spout, the thick stone
  was worn down to a broad groove an inch or two deep. Think of the
  countless thousands of hands that had pressed that spot in the
  ages that are gone, to so reduce a stone that is as hard as
  iron!</p>

  <p>They had a great public bulletin board in Pompeii--a place
  where announcements for gladiatorial combats, elections, and such
  things, were posted--not on perishable paper, but carved in
  enduring stone. One lady, who, I take it, was rich and well
  brought up, advertised a dwelling or so to rent, with baths and
  all the modern improvements, and several hundred shops,
  stipulating that the dwellings should not be put to immoral
  purposes. You can find out who lived in many a house in Pompeii
  by the carved stone door-plates affixed to them: and in the same
  way you can tell who they were that occupy the tombs. Every where
  around are things that reveal to you something of the customs and
  history of this forgotten people. But what would a volcano leave
  of an American city, if it once rained its cinders on it? Hardly
  a sign or a symbol to tell its story.</p>

  <p>In one of these long Pompeiian halls the skeleton of a man was
  found, with ten pieces of gold in one hand and a large key in the
  other. He had seized his money and started toward the door, but
  the fiery tempest caught him at the very threshold, and he sank
  down and died. One more minute of precious</p>
  <hr />
  <i>Page 334</i><br />
  time would have saved him. I saw the skeletons of a man, a woman,
  and two young girls. The woman had her hands spread wide apart,
  as if in mortal terror, and I imagined I could still trace upon
  her shapeless face something of the expression of wild despair
  that distorted it when the heavens rained fire in these streets,
  so many ages ago. The girls and the man lay with their faces upon
  their arms, as if they had tried to shield them from the
  enveloping cinders. In one apartment eighteen skeletons were
  found, all in sitting postures, and blackened places on the walls
  still mark their shapes and show their attitudes, like shadows.
  One of them, a woman, still wore upon her skeleton throat a
  necklace, with her name engraved upon it--JULIE DI DIOMEDE.
  <hr />
  <i>Page 335</i><br />

  <p>But perhaps the most poetical thing Pompeii has yielded to
  modern research, was that grand figure of a Roman soldier, clad
  in complete armor; who, true to his duty, true to his proud name
  of a soldier of Rome, and full of the stern courage which had
  given to that name its glory, stood to his post by the city gate,
  erect and unflinching, till the hell that raged around him
  <i>burned out</i> the dauntless spirit it could not conquer.</p>

  <p>We never read of Pompeii but we think of that soldier; we can
  not write of Pompeii without the natural impulse to grant to him
  the mention he so well deserves. Let us remember that he was a
  soldier--not a policeman--and so, praise him. Being a soldier, he
  staid,--because the warrior instinct forbade him to fly. Had he
  been a policeman he would have staid, also--because he would have
  been asleep.</p>

  <p>There are not half a dozen flights of stairs in Pompeii, and
  no other evidences that the houses were more than one story high.
  The people did not live in the clouds, as do the Venetians, the
  Genoese and Neapolitans of to-day.</p>

  <p>We came out from under the solemn mysteries of this city of
  the Venerable Past--this city which perished, with all its old
  ways and its quaint old fashions about it, remote centuries ago,
  when the Disciples were preaching the new religion, which is as
  old as the hills to us now--and went dreaming among the trees
  that grow over acres and acres of its still buried streets and
  squares, till a shrill whistle and the cry of <i>"All
  aboard--last train for Naples!"</i> woke me up and reminded me
  that I belonged in the nineteenth century, and was not a dusty
  mummy, caked with ashes and cinders, eighteen hundred years old.
  The transition was startling. The idea of a railroad train
  actually running to old dead Pompeii, and whistling irreverently,
  and calling for passengers in the most bustling and business-like
  way, was as strange a thing as one could imagine, and as
  unpoetical and disagreeable as it was strange.</p>

  <p>Compare the cheerful life and the sunshine of this day with
  the horrors the younger Pliny saw here, the 9th of November, A.D.
  79, when he was so bravely striving to remove his</p>
  <hr />
  <i>Page 336</i><br />
  mother out of reach of harm, while she begged him, with all a
  mother's unselfishness, to leave her to perish and save himself.

  <p><font size="-1">'By this time the murky darkness had so
  increased that one might have believed himself abroad in a black
  and moonless night, or in a chamber where all the lights had been
  extinguished. On every hand was heard the complaints of women,
  the wailing of children, and the cries of men. One called his
  father, another his son, and another his wife, and only by their
  voices could they know each other. Many in their despair begged
  that death would come and end their distress.</font></p>

  <p>"Some implored the gods to succor them, and some believed that
  this night was the last, the eternal night which should engulf
  the universe!</p>

  <p>"Even so it seemed to me--and I consoled myself for the coming
  death with the reflection: BEHOLD, THE WORLD IS PASSING
  AWAY!"</p>

  <p>After browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Bai&aelig;,
  of Pompeii, and after glancing down the long marble ranks of
  battered and nameless imperial heads that stretch down the
  corridors of the Vatican, one thing strikes me with a force it
  never had before: the unsubstantial, unlasting character of fame.
  Men lived long lives, in the olden time, and struggled feverishly
  through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory, in generalship, or
  in literature, and then laid them down and died, happy in the
  possession of an enduring history and a deathless name. Well,
  twenty little centuries flutter away, and what is left of these
  things? A crazy inscription on a block of stone, which snuffy
  antiquaries bother over and tangle up and make nothing out of but
  a bare name (which they spell wrong)--no history, no tradition,
  no poetry-- nothing that can give it even a passing interest.
  What may be left of General Grant's great name forty centuries
  hence? This--in the Encyclopedia for A. D. 5868, possibly:</p>

  <p><font size="-1">"URIAH S. (or Z.) GRAUNT--popular poet of
  ancient times in the Aztec provinces of the United States of
  British America. Some authors say flourished about A. D. 742; but
  the learned Ah-ah Foo- foo states that he was a cotemporary of
  Scharkspyre, the English poet, and flourished about A. D. 1328,
  some three centuries <i>after</i> the Trojan war instead of
  before it. He wrote 'Rock me to Sleep, Mother.'"</font></p>

  <p>These thoughts sadden me. I will to bed.</p>
