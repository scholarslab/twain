<hr><i>page 130</i><br>
We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame.  We had heard
of it before.  It surprises me sometimes to think how much we <i>do </i>know
and how intelligent we are.  We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a
moment; it was like the pictures.  We stood at a little distance and changed
from one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square
towers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints who had
been looking calmly down from their perches for ages.  The Patriarch of
Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and romance, and
preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago; and since that day
they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the most thrilling scenes,
the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary spectacles that have grieved or
delighted Paris.  These battered and broken-nosed old fellows saw many and many
a cavalcade of mail-clad knights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard
the bells above them toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew's Massacre, and
they saw the slaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the
carnage of the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two
Napoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a regiment of
servants in the Tuileries today--and they may possibly continue to stand there
until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away and the banners of a great
republic floating above its ruins.  I wish these old parties could speak.  They
could tell a tale worth the listening to.<p>
They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now <hr><i>page
131</i><br>
stands, in the old
Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago--remains of it are still preserved
in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D. 300; another
took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations of the present
cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100.  The ground ought to be measurably sacred
by this time, one would think.  One portion of this noble old edifice is
suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times.  It was built by Jean
Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience at rest--he had assassinated
the Duke of Orleans.  Alas!  Those good old times are gone when a murderer
could wipe the stain from his name and soothe his troubles to sleep simply by
getting out his bricks and mortar and building an addition to a church.<p>
The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars.  They
took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings for the
reinstitution of the presidential power--but precious soon they had occasion to
reconsider that motion and put it back again!  And they did.<p>
We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at the rich
stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and crimson saints and
martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great pictures in the chapels, and
then we were admitted to the sacristy and shown the magnificent robes which the
pope wore when he crowned Napoleon I; a wagonload of solid gold and silver
utensils used in the great public processions and ceremonies of the church;
some nails of the true cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the
crown of thorns.  We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a
church in the Azores, but no nails.  They showed us likewise the bloody robe
which that archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved
the wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft the
olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter.  His noble effort
cost him his life.  He was shot dead. They showed us a cast of his face taken
after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two vertebrae in which it
lodged.  These people have a somewhat singular
<hr><i>page 132</i><br>
 taste in the matter of relics.
Ferguson told us that the silver cross which the good archbishop wore at his
girdle was seized and thrown into the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud
for fifteen years, and then an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to
dive for it; he <i>did </i>dive for it and got it, and now it is there on
exhibition at Notre Dame, to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in
inanimate objects of miraculous intervention.<p>
Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead who die
mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal secret.  We
stood before a grating and looked through into a room which was hung all about
with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses, water-soaked; the delicate
garments of women and children; patrician vestments,
<hr><i>page 133</i><br>
hacked and stabbed and
stained with red; a hat that was crushed and bloody.  On a slanting stone lay a
drowned man, naked, swollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush
with a grip which death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose
it--mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed
beyond all help.  A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous fare.
We knew that the body and the clothing were there for identification by
friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or
grieve for its loss.  We grew meditative and wondered if, some forty years ago,
when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her knee, and
kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied pride to the
passersby, a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever flitted through her
brain.  I half feared that the mother or the wife or a brother of the dead man
might come while we stood there, but nothing of the kind occurred.  Men and
women came, and some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the
bars; others glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed
look--people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the
exhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see theatrical
spectacles every night.  When one of these looked in and passed on, I could not
help thinking:<p>
"Now this don't afford you any satisfaction--a party with his head shot off is
what <i>you</i> need."<p>
One night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only stayed a little
while.  We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however, and
therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment in a great
garden in the suburb of Asni&egrave;res.  We went to the railroad depot toward
evening, and Ferguson got tickets for a second-class carriage.  Such a perfect
jam of people I have not often seen--but there was no noise, no disorder, no
rowdyism.  Some of the women and young girls that entered the train we knew to
be of the <i>demi-monde,</i> but others we were not at all sure about.<p>
The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves
<hr><i>page 134</i><br>
 modestly and becomingly
all the way out, except that they smoked.  When we arrived at the garden in
Asni&egrave;res, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a place which had
flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving rows of ornamental
shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower convenient for eating ice cream
in.  We moved along the sinuous gravel walks, with the great concourse of girls
and young men, and suddenly a domed and filigreed white temple, starred over
and over and over again with brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen
sun.  Nearby was a large, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in
the same way, and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America.<p>
"Well!" I said.  "How is this?" It nearly took my breath away.<p>
Ferguson said an American--a New Yorker--kept the place, and was carrying on
quite a stirring opposition to the <i>Jardin Mabille.</i><p>
Crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the
garden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the temple,
drinking wine and coffee or smoking.  The dancing had not begun yet.  Ferguson
said there was to be an exhibition.  The famous Blondin was going to perform on
a tightrope in another part of the garden.  We went thither.  Here the light
was dim, and the masses of people were pretty closely packed together.  And now
I made a mistake which any donkey might make, but a sensible man never.  I
committed an error which I find myself repeating every day of my life.
Standing right before a young lady, I said:<p>
"Dan, just look at this girl, how beautiful she is!"<p>
"I thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment, sir, than for
the extraordinary publicity you have given to it!" This in good, pure
English.<p>
We took a walk, but my spirits were very, very sadly dampened.  I did not feel
right comfortable for some time afterward.  Why <i>will</i> people be so stupid
as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of ten thousand
persons?<p>
<hr><i>page 135</i><br>
But Blondin came out shortly.  He appeared on a stretched cable, far away above
the sea of tossing hats and handkerchiefs, and in the glare of the hundreds of
rockets that whizzed heavenward by him he looked like a wee insect.  He
balanced his pole and walked the length of his rope--two or three hundred feet;
he came back and got a man and carried him across; he returned to the center
and danced a jig; next he performed some gymnastic and balancing feats too
perilous to afford a pleasant spectacle; and he finished by fastening to his
person a thousand Roman candies, Catherine wheels, serpents and rockets of all
manner of brilliant colors, setting them on fire all at once and walking and
waltzing across his rope again in a blinding blaze of glory that lit up the
garden and the people's faces like a great conflagration at midnight.<p>
The dance had begun, and we adjourned to the temple.  Within it was a drinking
saloon, and all around it was a
<hr><i>page 136</i><br>
broad circular platform for the dancers.  I
backed up against the wall of the temple and waited.  Twenty sets formed, the
music struck up, and then--I placed my hands before my face for very shame.
But I looked through my fingers.  They were dancing the renowned <i>"Cancan."</i> A
handsome girl in the set before me tripped forward lightly to meet the opposite
gentleman, tripped back again, grasped her dresses vigorously on both sides
with her hands, raised them pretty high, danced an extraordinary jig that had
more activity and exposure about it than any jig I ever saw before, and then,
drawing her clothes still higher, she advanced gaily to the center and launched
a vicious kick full at her <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>that must infallibly have
removed his nose if he had been seven feet high.  It was a mercy he was only
six.<p>
That is the <i>can-can.</i>  The idea of it is to dance as wildly, as noisily, as
furiously as you can; expose yourself as much as possible if you are a woman;
and kick as high as you can, no matter which sex you belong to.  There is no
word of exaggeration in this.  Any of the staid, respectable, aged people who
were there that night can testify to the truth of that statement.  There were a
good many such people present. I suppose French morality is not of that
straight-laced description which is shocked at trifles.<p>
I moved aside and took a general view of the <i>can-can.</i>  Shouts, laughter, furious
music, a bewildering chaos of darting and intermingling forms, stormy jerking
and snatching of gay dresses, bobbing beads, flying arms, lightning flashes of
white-stockinged
<hr><<i>page 137</i><br>
calves and dainty slippers in the air, and then a grand final
rush, riot, a terrific hubbub, and a wild stampede!  Heavens!  Nothing like it
has been seen on earth since trembling Tam O'Shanter saw the devil and the
witches at their orgies that stormy night in "Alloway's auld haunted kirk."<p>
We visited the Louvre, at a time when we had no silk purchases in view, and
looked at its miles of paintings by the old masters.  Some of them were
beautiful, but at the same time they carried such evidences about them of the
cringing spirit of those great men that we found small pleasure in examining
them.  Their nauseous adulation of princely patrons was more prominent to me
and chained my attention more surely than the charms of color and expression
which are claimed to be in the pictures.  Gratitude for kindnesses is well, but
it seems to me that some of those artists carried it so far that it ceased to
be gratitude and became worship.  If there is a plausible excuse for the
worship of men, then by all means let us forgive Rubens and his brethren.<p>
But I will drop the subject, lest I say something about the old masters that
might as well be left unsaid.<p>
Of course we drove in the<i> Bois de Boulogne,</i> that limitless park, with its
forests, its lakes, its cascades, and its broad avenues.  There were thousands
upon thousands of vehicles abroad, and the scene was full of life and gaiety.
There were very common hacks, with father and mother and all the children in
them; conspicuous little open carriages with celebrated ladies of questionable
reputation in them; there were dukes and duchesses abroad, with gorgeous
footmen perched behind, and equally gorgeous outriders perched on each of the
six horses; there were blue and silver, and green and gold, and pink and black,
and all sorts and descriptions of stunning and startling liveries out, and I
almost yearned to be a flunky myself, for the sake of the fine clothes.<p>
But presently the Emperor came along and he outshone them all.  He was preceded
by a bodyguard of gentlemen on horseback in showy uniforms, his carriage horses
(there appeared <hr><i>page 138</i><br>
to be somewhere in the remote neighborhood of a thousand of
them) were bestridden by gallant-looking fellows, also in stylish uniforms, and
after the carriage followed another detachment of bodyguards.  Everybody got
out of the way; everybody bowed to the Emperor and his friend the Sultan; and
they went by on a swinging trot and disappeared.<p>
I will not describe the <i>Bois de Boulogne.</i>  I cannot do it.  It is simply a
beautiful, cultivated, endless, wonderful wilderness.  It is an enchanting
place.  It is in Paris now, one may say, but a crumbling old cross in one
portion of it reminds one that it was not always so.  The cross marks the spot
where a celebrated troubadour was waylaid and murdered in the fourteenth
century.  It was in this park that that fellow with an unpronounceable name
made the attempt upon the Russian czar's life last spring with a pistol.  The
bullet struck a tree.  Ferguson showed us the place.  Now in America that
interesting tree would be chopped down or forgotten within the next five years,
but it will be treasured here.  The guides will point it out to visitors for
the next eight hundred years, and when it decays and falls down they will put
up another there and go on with the same old story just the same.
