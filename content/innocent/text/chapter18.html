<body><H2>Chapter 18</H2>
<hr><i>page 171</i><br>
All day long we sped through a mountainous country whose
peaks were bright with sunshine, whose hillsides were dotted with pretty villas
sitting in the midst of gardens and shrubbery, and whose deep ravines were cool
and shady and looked ever so inviting from where we and the birds were winging
our flight through the sultry upper air.<p>
We had plenty of chilly tunnels wherein to check our perspiration, though.  We
timed one of them.  We were twenty minutes passing through it, going at the
rate of thirty to thirty-five miles an hour.<p>
Beyond Alessandria we passed the battlefield of Marengo.<p>
Toward dusk we drew near Milan and caught glimpses of the city and the blue
mountain peaks beyond.  But we were not caring for these things--they did not
interest us in the least.  We were in a fever of impatience; we were dying to
see the renowned cathedral!  We watched--in this direction and that--all
around--everywhere.  We needed no one to point it out--we did not wish anyone
to point it out--we would recognize it even in the desert of the great
Sahara.<p>
At last, a forest of graceful needles, shimmering in the amber sunlight, rose
slowly above the pygmy housetops, as one sometimes sees, in the far horizon, a
gilded and pinnacled mass of cloud lift itself above the waste of waves, at
sea--the cathedral!  We knew it in a moment.<p>
Half of that night and all of the next day this architectural autocrat was our
sole object of interest.<p>
What a wonder it is!  So grand, so solemn, so vast! And
<hr><i>page 172</i><br>yet so delicate, so
airy, so graceful! A very world of solid weight, and yet it seems in the soft
moonlight only a fairy delusion of frostwork that might vanish with a breath!
How sharply its pinnacled angles and its wilderness of spires were cut against
the sky, and how richly their shadows fell upon its snowy roof! It was a
vision!--a miracle!--an anthem sung in stone, a poem wrought in marble!<p>
Howsoever you look at the great cathedral, it is noble, it is beautiful!
Wherever you stand in Milan or within seven miles of Milan, it is visible and
when it is visible, no other object can chain your whole attention.  Leave your
eyes unfettered by your will but a single instant and they will surely turn to
seek it.  It is the first thing you look for when you rise in the morning, and
the last your lingering gaze rests upon at night.  Surely it must be the
princeliest creation that ever brain of man conceived.<p>
At nine o'clock in the morning we went and stood before this marble colossus.
The central one of its five great doors is bordered with a bas-relief of birds
and fruits and beasts and insects, which have been so ingeniously carved out of
the marble that they seem like living creatures--and the figures are so
numerous and the design so complex that one might study it a week without
exhausting its interest.  On the great steeple--surmounting the myriad of
spires--inside of the spires--over the doors, the windows--in nooks and comers
everywhere that a niche or a perch can be found about the enormous building,
from summit to base, there is a marble statue, and every statue is a study in
itself!  Raphael, Angelo, Canova--giants like these gave birth to the designs,
and their own pupils carved them.  Every face is eloquent with expression, and
every attitude is full of grace.  Away above, on the lofty roof, rank on rank
of carved and fretted spires spring high in the air, and through their rich
tracery one sees the sky beyond.  In their midst the central steeple towers
proudly up like the mainmast of some great Indiaman among a fleet of
coasters.<p>
We wished to go aloft.  The sacristan showed us a marble
<hr><i>page 173</i><br>
stairway (of course it
was marble, and of the purest and whitest--there is no other stone, no brick,
no wood, among its building materials) and told us to go up one hundred and
eighty-two steps and stop till he came.  It was not necessary to say stop--we
should have done that anyhow.  We were tired by the time we got there.  This
was the roof.  Here, springing from its broad marble flagstones, were the long
files of spires, looking very tall close at hand, but diminishing in the
distance like the pipes of an organ.  We could see now that the statue on the
top of each was the size of a large man, though they all looked like dolls from
the street.  We could
<hr><i>page 174</i><br>see also that from the inside of each and every one of
these hollow spires, from sixteen to thirty-one beautiful marble statues looked
out upon the world below.<p>
From the eaves to the comb of the roof stretched in endless succession great
curved marble beams, like the fore-and-aft braces of a steamboat, and along
each beam from end to end stood up a row of richly carved flowers and
fruits--each separate and distinct in kind, and over 15,000 species
represented.  At a little distance these rows seem to close together like the
ties of a railroad track, and then the mingling together of the buds and
blossoms of this marble garden forms a picture that is very charming to the
eye.<p>
We descended and entered.  Within the church, long rows of fluted columns, like
huge monuments, divided the building
<hr><i>page 175</i><br>
into broad aisles, and on the figured
pavement fell many a soft blush from the painted windows above.  I knew the
church was very large, but I could not fully appreciate its great size until I
noticed that the men standing far down by the altar looked like boys, and
seemed to glide, rather than walk.  We loitered about gazing aloft at the
monster windows all aglow with brilliantly colored scenes in the lives of the
Saviour and his followers.  Some of these pictures are mosaics, and so
artistically are their thousand particles of tinted glass or stone put together
that the work has all the smoothness and finish of a painting.  We counted
sixty panes of glass in one window, and each pane was adorned with one of these
master achievements of genius and patience.<p>
The guide showed us a coffee-colored piece of sculpture which he said was
considered to have come from the hand of Phidias, since it was not possible
that any other artist, of any epoch, could have copied nature with such
faultless accuracy.  The figure was that of a man without a skin; with every
vein, artery, muscle, every fiber and tendon and tissue of the human frame
represented in minute detail.  It looked natural, because somehow it looked as
if it were in pain.  A skinned man would be likely to look that way unless his
attention were occupied with some other matter.  It was a hideous thing, and
yet there was a fascination about it somewhere.  I am very sorry I saw it,
because I shall always see it now.  I shall dream of it sometimes.  I shall
dream that it is resting its corded arms on the bed's head and looking down on
me with its dead eyes; I shall dream that it is stretched between the sheets
with me and touching me with its exposed muscles and its stringy cold legs.<p>
It is hard to forget repulsive things.  I remember yet how I ran off from
school once, when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concluded to
climb into the window of my father's office and sleep on a lounge, because I
had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed.  As I lay on the lounge
and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied I could see a long,
dusky, shapeless thing stretched
<hr><i>page 176</i><br>
upon the floor.  A cold shiver went through
me.  I turned my face to the wall.  That did not answer.  I was afraid that
that thing would creep over and seize me in the dark.  I turned back and stared
at it for minutes and minutes--they seemed hours.  It appeared to me that the
lagging moonlight never, never would get to it.  I turned to the wall and
counted twenty, to pass the feverish time away.  I looked--the pale square was
nearer.  I turned again and counted fifty--it was almost touching it.  With
desperate will I turned again and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in
a tremble.  A white human hand lay in the moonlight! Such an awful sinking at
the heart--such a sudden gasp for breath!  I felt--I cannot tell<i> what</i>
 I felt.  When I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again.
But no boy could have remained so with that mysterious hand behind him.  I
counted again and looked--the most of a naked arm was
<hr><i>page 177</i><br>
exposed.  I put my hands
over my eyes and counted till I could stand it no longer, and then--the pallid
face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawn down, and the eyes
fixed and glassy in death!  I raised to a sitting posture and glowered on that
corpse till the light crept down the bare breastline by line--inch by
inch--past the nipple--and then it disclosed a ghastly stab!<p>
I went away from there.  I do not say that I went away in any sort of a hurry,
but I simply went--that is sufficient.  I went out at the window, and I carried
the sash along with me. I did not need the sash, but it was handier to take it
than it was to leave it, and so I took it.  I was not scared, but I was
considerably agitated.<p>
When I reached home, they whipped me, but I enjoyed it. It seemed perfectly
delightful.  That man had been stabbed near the office that afternoon, and they
carried him in there to doctor him, but he only lived an hour.  I have slept in
the same room with him often since then--in my dreams.<p>
Now we will descend into the crypt, under the grand altar of Milan Cathedral,
and receive an impressive sermon from lips that have been silent and hands that
have been gestureless for three hundred years.<p>
The priest stopped in a small dungeon and held up his candle.  This was the
last resting place of a good man, a warmhearted, unselfish man; a man whose
whole life was given to succoring the poor, encouraging the fainthearted,
visiting the sick; in relieving distress whenever and wherever he found it.
His heart, his hand, and his purse were always open.  With his story in one's
mind we can almost see his benignant countenance moving calmly among the
haggard faces of Milan in the days when the plague swept the city, brave where
all others were cowards, full of compassion where pity had been crushed out of
all other breasts by the instinct of self-preservation gone mad with terror,
cheering all, praying with all, helping all, with hand and brain and purse, at
a time when parents forsook their children, the friend deserted
<hr><i>page 178</i><br> the friend, and
the brother turned away from the sister while her pleadings were still wailing
in his ears.<p>
This was good St. Charles Borromeo, Bishop of Milan.  The people idolized him;
princes lavished uncounted treasures upon him.  We stood in his tomb.  Nearby
was the sarcophagus, lighted by the dripping candles.  The walls were faced
with bas-reliefs representing scenes in his life done in massive silver.  The
priest put on a short white lace garment over his black robe, crossed himself,
bowed reverently, and began to turn a windlass slowly.  The sarcophagus
separated in two parts, lengthwise, and the lower part sank down and disclosed
a coffin of rock crystal as clear as the atmosphere.  Within lay the body,
robed in costly habiliments covered with gold embroidery and starred with
scintillating gems.  The decaying head was black with age, the dry skin was
drawn tight to the bones, the eyes were gone, there was a hole in the temple
and another in the cheek, and the skinny lips were parted as in a ghastly
smile! Over this dreadful face, its dust and decay and its mocking grin, hung a
crown sown thick with flashing brilliants; and upon the breast lay crosses and
crosiers of solid gold that were splendid with emeralds and diamonds.<p>
How poor and cheap and trivial these gewgaws seemed in presence of the
solemnity, the grandeur, the awful majesty of Death! Think of Milton,
Shakespeare, Washington, standing before a reverent world tricked out in the
glass beads, the brass earrings, and tin trumpery of the savages of the plains!
Dead Borromeo preached his pregnant sermon, and its burden was: You that
worship the vanities of earth--you that long for worldly honor, worldly wealth,
worldly fame--behold their worth!<p>
To us it seemed that so good a man, so kind a heart, so simple a nature,
deserved rest and peace in a grave sacred from the intrusion of prying eyes,
and believed that he himself would have preferred to have it so, but
peradventure our wisdom was at fault in this regard.<p>
As we came out upon the floor of the church again, another priest volunteered
to show us the treasures of the church.
<hr><i>page 179</i><br>
What, more?  The furniture of the
narrow chamber of death we had just visited weighed six millions of francs in
ounces and carats alone, without a penny thrown into the account for the costly
workmanship bestowed upon them! But we followed into a large room filled with
tall wooden presses like wardrobes.  He threw them open, and behold, the
cargoes of "crude bullion" of the assay offices of Nevada faded out of my
memory.  There were Virgins and bishops there, above their natural size, made
of solid silver, each worth, by weight, from eight hundred thousand to two
millions of francs, and bearing gemmed books in their hands worth eighty
thousand; there were bas-reliefs that weighed six hundred pounds, carved in
solid silver; crosiers and crosses, and candlesticks six and eight feet high,
all of virgin gold and brilliant with precious stones; and beside these were
all manner of cups and vases and such things, rich in proportion.  It was an
Aladdin's
<hr><i>page 180</i><br>
palace.  The treasures here, by simple weight, without counting
workmanship, were valued at fifty millions of francs!  If I could get the
custody of them for a while, I fear me the market price of silver bishops would
advance shortly, on account of their exceeding scarcity in the Cathedral of
Milan.<p>
The priests showed us two of St. Paul's fingers and one of St. Peter's; a bone
of Judas Iscariot (it was black) and also bones of all the other disciples; a
handkerchief in which the Saviour had left the impression of his face.  Among
the most precious of the relics were a stone from the Holy Sepulchre, part of
the crown of thorns (they have a whole one at Notre Dame), a fragment of the
purple robe worn by the Saviour, a nail from the Cross, and a picture of the
Virgin and Child painted by the veritable hand of St. Luke.  This is the second
of St. Luke's Virgins we have seen.  Once a year all these holy relics are
carried in procession through the streets of Milan.<p>
I like to revel in the dryest details of the great cathedral.  The building is
five hundred feet long by one hundred and eighty wide, and the principal
steeple is in the neighborhood of four hundred feet high.  It has 7,148 marble
statues, and will have upwards of three thousand more when it is finished.  In
addition it has one thousand five hundred bas-reliefs.  It has one hundred and
thirty-six spires--twenty-one more are to be added.  Each spire is surmounted
by a statue six and a half feet high.  Everything about the church is marble,
and all from the same quarry; it was bequeathed to the Archbishopric for this
purpose centuries ago.  So nothing but the mere workmanship costs; still, that
is expensive--the bill foots up six hundred and eighty-four millions of francs
thus far (considerably over a hundred millions of dollars), and it is estimated
that it will take a hundred and twenty years yet to finish the cathedral.  It
looks complete, but is far from being so.  We saw a new statue put in its niche
yesterday, alongside of one which had been standing these four hundred years,
they said.  There are four staircases leading up to the main steeple, each of
which cost a hundred thousand dollars,
<hr><i>page 181</i><br>
with the four hundred and eight statues
which adorn them.  Marco Compioni was the architect who designed the wonderful
structure more than five hundred years ago, and it took him forty-six years to
work out the plan and get it ready to hand over to the builders.  He is dead
now.  The building was begun a little less than five hundred years ago, and the
third generation hence will not see it completed.<p>
The building looks best by moonlight, because the older portions of it, being
stained with age, contrast unpleasantly
<hr><i>page 182</i><br>
with the newer and whiter portions.  It
seems somewhat too broad for its height, but maybe familiarity with it might
dissipate this impression.<p>
They say that the Cathedral of Milan is second only to St. Peter's at Rome.  I
cannot understand how it can be second to anything made by human hands.<p>
We bid it good-bye now--possibly for all time.  How surely, in some future day,
when the memory of it shall have lost its vividness, shall we half believe we
have seen it in a wonderful dream, but never with waking eyes!
