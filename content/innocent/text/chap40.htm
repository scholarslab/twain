<hr><i>Page 418</i><br>

<p>THIS has been a stirring day. The Superintendent of the
railway put a train at our disposal, and did us the further kindness of
accompanying us to Ephesus and giving to us his watchful care. We
brought sixty scarcely perceptible donkeys in the freight cars, for we
had much ground to go over. We have seen some of the most
grotesque costumes, along the line of the railroad, that can be
imagined. I am glad that no possible combination of words could
describe them, for I might then be foolish enough to attempt it.</p>
<p>At ancient Ayassalook, in the midst of a forbidding desert, we
came upon long lines of ruined aqueducts, and other remnants of
architectural grandeur, that told us plainly enough we were nearing
what had been a metropolis, once. We left the train and mounted the
donkeys, along with our invited guests--pleasant young gentlemen
from the officers' list of an American man-of-war.</p>
<p>The little donkeys had saddles upon them which were made very
high in order that the rider's feet might not drag the ground. The
preventative did not work well in the cases of our tallest pilgrims,
however. There were no bridles--nothing but a single rope, tied to the
bit. It was purely ornamental, for the donkey cared nothing for it. If he
were drifting to starboard, you might put your helm down hard the
other way, if it were any satisfaction to you to do it, but he would
continue to drift to starboard all the same. There was only one process
which could be depended on, and it was to

<hr><i>Page 419</i><br>

get down and lift his rear around until his head pointed in the right
direction, or take him under your arm and carry him to a part of the
road which he could not get out of without climbing. The sun flamed
down as hot as a furnace, and neckscarfs, veils and umbrellas seemed
hardly any protection; they served only to make the long procession
look more than ever fantastic--for be it known the ladies were all
riding astride because they could not stay on the shapeless saddles
sidewise, the men were perspiring and out of temper, their
feet were banging against the rocks, the donkeys were capering in
every direction but the right one and being belabored
with clubs for it, and every Dow and then a broad umbrella
would suddenly go down out of the cavalcade, announcing to
all that one more pilgrim had bitten the dust. It was a wilder
picture than those solitudes had seen for many a day. No
donkeys ever existed that were as hard to navigate as these, I
think, or that had so many vile, exasperating instincts. Occasionally

<hr><i>Page 420</i><br>

signally we grew so tired and breathless with fighting them that we had to
desist,--and immediately the donkey would come down to a deliberate walk.
This, with the fatigue, and the sun, would put a man asleep; and soon as the
man was asleep, the donkey would lie down.  My  donkey shall never see his
boyhood's home again. He has lain down once too
often. We all stood in the
vast theatre of ancient Epllesus,--the stone-benched amphitheatre I mean --and
had our picture taken. We looked as
proper there as we would look any where, I suppose. We do
not embellish the general desolation of a desert much. We
add what dignity we can to a stately ruin with our green umbrellas and jackasses, but it is little.
However, we mean
well.</p>
<p>I wish to say a brief word of the aspect of Ephesus.</p>
<p>On a high, steep hill, toward the sea, is a gray ruin of ponderous blocks of
marble, wherein, tradition says, St. Paul was imprisoned eighteen centuries
ago. From these old walls you have the finest view of the desolate scene where
once stood Ephesus, the proudest city of ancient times, and whose Temple of
Diana was so noble in design, and so exquisite of workmanship, that it ranked
high in the list of the Seven Wonders of the World.</p>
<p>Behind you is the sea; in front is a level green valley, (a marsh, in fact,)
extending far away among the mountains; to the right of the front view is the
old citadel of Ayassalook, on a high hill; the ruined Mosque of the Sultan Selim
stands near it in the plain, (this is built over the grave of St. John,

<hr><i>Page  421</i><br>

and was formerly  Christian Church ;) further toward you is the hill of
Pion, around whose front is clustered all that remains of the ruins of
Ephesus that still stand; divided from it by a narrow valley is the long,
rocky, rugged mountain of Coressus. The scene is a pretty one, and yet
desolate--for in that wide plain no man can live, and in it is no human
habitation. But for the crumbling arches and monstrous piers and
broken walls that rise from the foot of the hill of Pion, one could not
believe that in this place once stood a city whose renown is older than
tradition itself. It is incredible to reflect that things as familiar all over
the world to-day as household words, belong in the history and in the
shadowy legends of this silent, mournful solitude. We speak of Apollo
and of Diana--they were born here; of the metamorphosis of Syrinx into
a reed--it was done here; of the great god Pan--he dwelt in the caves of
this hill of Coressus; of the Amazons-- this was their best prized home;
of Bacchus and Hercules
both fought the warlike women here; of the Cyclops--they laid the
ponderous marble blocks of some of the ruins yonder; of Homer--this
was one of his many birthplaces; of Cirmon of Athens; of Alcibiades,
Lysander, Agesilaus--they visited here; so did Alexander the Great; so
did Hannibal and Antiochus, Scipio, Lucullus and Sylla; Brutus,
Cassius, Pompey, Cicero, and Augustus; Antony was a judge in this
place, and left his seat in the open court, while the advocates were
speaking, to run after Cleopatra, who passed the door; from this city
these two sailed on pleasure excursions, in galleys with silver oars and
perfumed sails, and with companies of beautiful girls to serve them, and
actors and musicians to amuse them; in days that seem almost modern,
so remote are they from the early history of this city, Paul the Apostle
preached the new religion here, and so did John, and here it is supposed
the former was pitted against wild beasts, for in 1 Corinthians, xv. 32
he says:

<blockquote><font size=2>" If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,"
        etc.,</font></blockquote>

when many men still  lived who had seen the Christ; here

<hr><i>Page 422</i><br>

Mary Magdalen died, and here the Virgin Mary ended her days with John,
albeit Rome has since judged it best to locate her grave elsewhere; six or
seven hundred years ago--almost yesterday, as it were--troops of mail-clad
Crusaders thronged the streets; and to come down to trifles, we speak of
meandering streams, and find a new interest in a common word when we
discover that the crooked river Meander, in yonder valley, gave it to our
dictionary. It makes me feel as old as these
dreary hills to look down upon these moss-hung ruins, this historic
desolation. One may read the Scriptures and believe, but he can not go and
stand yonder in the ruined theatre and in imagination people it again with the
vanished multitudes who mobbed Paul's
comrades there and shouted, with one voice, " Great is Diana of the
Ephesians !" The idea of a shout in such a solitude as this almost makes one
shudder.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful city, this Ephesus. Go where you will about these
broad plains, you find the most exquisitely eculptured marble fragments
scattered thick among the dust and weeds; and protruding from the ground,
or lying prone upon it, are beautiful fluted columns of  porphyry and
all precious

<hr><i>Page 423</i><br>
marbles; and at every step you find elegantly carved capitals and massive
bases, and polished tablets engraved with Greek inscriptions. It is a world
of precious relics, a wilderness of marred and mutilated gems. And yet what
are these things to the wonders that lie buried here under the ground ? At
Constantinople, at Pisa, in the cities of Spain, are great mosques and
cathedrals, whose grandest columns came from the temples and palaces of
Ephesus, and yet one has only to scratch the ground here to match them. We
shall never know what magnificence is, until this imperial city is laid bare
to the sun.</p>
<p>The finest piece of sculpture we have yet seen and the one that
impressed us most, (for we do not know much about art and can not easily
work up ourselves into ecstacies over it,) is one that lies in this old theatre
of Ephesus which St. Paul's riot has made so celebrated. It is only the
headless body of a man, clad in a coat of mail, with  a Medusahead upon the breast-plate, but we
feel persuaded that such dignity and
such majesty were never thrown into a form of stone before.</p>
      <p>  What builders they were, these men of antiquity! The massive
arches of some of these ruins rest upon piers that are

<hr><i>Page 424</i><br>

fifteen feet square and built entirely of solid blocks of marble, some
of which are as large as a Saratoga trunk, and some the size of a
boarding-house sofa. They are not shells or shafts of stone filled
inside with rubbish, but the whole pier is a mass of solid masonry.
Vast arches, that may have been the gates of the city, are built in the
same way. They have braved the storms and sieges of three thousand
years, and have been shaken by many an earthquake, but still they
stand. When they
dig alongside of them, they find ranges of ponderous masonry that are
as perfect in every detail as they were the day those old Cyclopian
giants finished them. An English Company is going to excavate
Ephesus--and then !</p>

<p>And now am I reminded of--</p>






<hr><i>Page 425</i><br>
In the Mount of Pion, yonder, is the Cave of the Seven Sleepers. Once
upon a time, about fifteen hundred years ago, seven young men lived
near each other in Ephesus, who belonged to the despised sect of the
Christians. It came to pass that the good King Maximilianus, (I am
telling this story for nice little boys and girls,) it came to pass, I say,
that the good  King  Maximilianus fell to persecuting the Christians,
and as time rolled on he made it very warm for them. So the seven
young men said one to the other, let us get up and travel. And they got
up and traveled. They tarried not to bid their fathers and mothers good-bye, or any friend they
knew. They only took certain moneys which
their parents had, and garments
that belonged unto their friends, whereby they might remember them
when far away; and they took also the dog Ketmehr, which was the
property of their neighbor Malchus, because the beast did run his head
into a noose which one of the young men was carrying carelessly, and
they had not time to release him; and they took also certain chickens
that

<hr><i>Page 426</i><br>

seemed lonely in the neighboring coops, and likewise some bottles of
curious liquors that stood near the grocer's window; and then they
departed from the city. By-and-by they came to a marvelous cave in the
Hill of Pion and entered into it and feasted, and presently they hurried
on again. But they forgot the bottles of curious liquors, and left them
behind. They traveled in many lands, and had many strange adventures.
They were virtuous young men, and lost no opportunity that fell in
their way to make their livelihood. Their motto was in these words,
namely, " Procrastination is the thief of time." And so, whenever they
did come upon a man who was alone, they said, Behold, this person
hath the wherewithal--let us go through him. And they went through
him. At the end of five years they had waxed tired of travel and
adventure, and longed to revisit their old home again and hear the
voices and see the faces that were dear unto their youth. Therefore they
went through such parties as fell in their way where they sojourned at
that time, and journeyed -back toward Ephesus again. For the good
King Maximilianus was become converted unto the new faith, and the
Christians rejoiced because they were no longer persecuted. One day
as the sun went down, they came to the cave in the Mount of Pion, and
they said, each to his fellow, Let us sleep here, and go and feast and
make merry with our friends when the morning cometh.  And each of
the seven lifted up his voice and said, It is a whiz.  So they went in, and
lo, where they had put them, there lay the bottles of strange liquors,
and they judged that age had not impaired  their excellence. Wherein
the wanderers were right, and the heads of the same were level.  So
each of the young men drank six bottles, and behold they felt very
tired, then, and lay down and slept soundly.</p>
<p>When they awoke, one of them, Johannes--surnamed
Smithianus--said, We are naked. And it was so. Their raiment was all
gone, and the money which they had gotten from a stranger whom they
had proceeded through as they approached the city, was lying upon the
ground, corroded and rusted and defaced. Likewise the dog Ketmehr
was gone, and nothing save the brass that was upon his collar
remained. They wondered

 <hr><i>Page 427</i><br>


much at these things. But they took the money, and they wrapped
about their bodies some leaves, and came up to the top of the hill. Then
were they perplexed. The wonderful temple of Diana was gone; many
grand edifices they had never seen before stood in the city; men in
strange garbs  moved about the streets, and every thing was
changed.</p>
<p>Johannes said, It hardly seems like Ephesus. Yet here is the great
gymnasium; here is the mighty theatre, wherein I have seen seventy
thousand men assembled; here is the Agora; there is the font where the
sainted John the Baptist immersed the converts; yonder is the prison of
the good St. Paul, where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chains
that bound him and be cured of our distempers; I see the tomb of the
disciple Luke, and afar off is the church wherein repose the ashes of the
holy John, where the Christians of Ephesus go twice a year to gather the
dust from the tomb, which is able to make bodies whole again that are
corrupted by disease, and cleanse the soul from sin; but see how the
wharves encroach upon the sea, and what multitudes of ships are
anchored in the bay; see, also, how the city hath stretched abroad, far
over the valley behind Pion, and even unto the walls of Ayassalook; and
lo, all the hills are white with palaces and ribbed with colonnades of
marble. How mighty is Ephesus become !</p>
<p>And  wondering at what their eyes had seen, they went down into
the city and purchased garments and clothed themselves. And when
they would  have passed on, the merchant  bit  the coins which they had
given him, with his teeth, and turned them about and looked curiously
upon them, and cast them upon his counter, and listened if they rang;
and then he said, These be bogus.  And they said, Depart thou  to
Hades, and went their way. When they were come to their houses, they
recognized them, albeit they seemed old and mean; and they rejoiced,
and were glad. They ran to the doors, and knocked, and strangers
opened, and looked inquringly upon them. And they said, with great
excitement, while their hearts beat high, and the color in their faces
came and went, Where is my father? Where is my mother? Where are
Dionysius and

<hr><i>Page 428</i><br>

Serapion, and Pericles, and Decius ? And the strangers that opened
said, We know  not these.  The Seven said, How, you know them
not? How long have ye dwelt here, and whither are they gone that
dwelt here before ye ? And the strangers said, Ye play upon us with
a jest, young men; we and our fathers have sojourned under these
roofs these six generations; the names ye utter rot upon the tombs,
and they that bore them have run their brief race, have laughed and
sung, have borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted
them, and are at rest; for nine-score years the summers have come
and gone, and the autumn leaves have fallen, since the roses faded
out of their cheeks and they laid them to sleep with the dead.</p>
<p>Then the seven young men turned them away from their homes,
and the strangers shut the doors upon them. The wanderers marveled
greatly, and looked into the faces of all they met, as hoping to find
one that they knew; but all were strange, and passed them by and
spake no friendly word. They were sore distressed and sad.  Presently
they spake unto a citizen and said, Who is King in Ephesus ? And the
citizen answered and said, Whence come ye that ye know not that
great Laertius reigns in Ephesus ? They looked one at the other,
greatly perplexed, and presently asked again, Where, then, is the
good King Maximilianus ? The citizen moved him apart, as one who
is afraid, and said, Verily these  men be mad, and dream dreams, else
would they know that the King  whereof  they speak is dead above
two hundred years agone.</p>
<p>Then the scales fell from the eyes of the Seven, and one said,
Alas, that we drank of the curious liquors. They have made us weary,
and in dreamless sleep these two long centuries have we lain. Our
homes are desolate, our friends are dead. Behold, the jig is up--let us
die. And that same day went they forth and laid them down and died.
And in that self-same day, likewise, the Seven-up did cease in
Ephesus, for that the Seven that were up were down again, and
departed and dead withal. And the names that be upon their tombs,
even unto this time, are Johannes Smithianus, Trumps, Gift, High,
and
<hr><i>Page 429</i><br>
Low, Jack, and The Game. And with the sleepers lie also the bottles wherin
were once  the curious liquors: and upon them

is writ, in ancient letters, such

                words as

these-- Dames of heathen gods of olden time, perchance: Rumpunch,
Jinsling, Egnog. </p>

<p>Such is the story
of the Seven Sleepers, (with slight variations,) and I know it
is true, because I have seen the cave myself.</p>

<p>Really, so firm a faith had the ancients
this legend, that as late as eight or nine hundred years ago, learned travelers
held it in superstitious fear. Two of them record that they  ventured into it,
but ran quickly  out again, not daring to tarry lest they should fall asleep and
outlive their great grand-children a century  or so. Even at this day the
ignorant denizens of the neighboring country  prefer not to sleep in it.</p>
