<hr><i>Page 430</i><br>

<p>WHEN I last made a memorandum, we were at Ephesus. We are in Syria, now, encamped in
the mountaina of  Lebanon.
The interregnum has been long, both as to time and distance. We brought not a relic from
Ephesus! After gathering up
fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments from the interior work of the Mosques;
and after bringing them
at a cost of infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railway  depot, a
government officer compelled  all 
who had such things to disgorge!  He had an order from Constantinople to <i>look out  for our
party,</i> and see that we carried
nothing off.  It was a wise, a just, and a  well-deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation. I never
resist a temptation to
plunder a stranger's premises without feeling insufferably  vain about it. This time I felt proud
beyond expression. I was
serene in the midst of the scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottoman government for its affront 
offered to a pleasuring
party of entirely respectable gentlemen and ladies I said, " We that have free souls, it touches us
not." The shoe not only
pinched our party, but it pinched hard; a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order was
inclosed in an envelop
bearing the seal of the British Embassy  at Constantinople, and  therefore must have been inspired
by the representative of
the Queen. This was bad--very bad. Coming solely from the Ottomans, it might have signified
only Ottoman hatred of
Christians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressing it; but coming from the
Christianized, educated,
politic British legation, it simply intimated that we were a sort 

<hr><i>Page 431</i><br>

of gentlemen and ladies who would bear watching! So the
party regarded it, and were incensed accordingly. The truth
doubtless was, that the same precautions would have been
taken  against<i> any</i> travelers, because the English Company
who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, and have
paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and
deserve to be. They can not afford to run the risk of having
their hospitality abused by travelers, especially since travelers
are such notorions scorners of honest behavior.</p>

                  <p>  We sailed from Smyrna, in the wildest spirit of expectancy,
for the chief feature, the grand goal of the expedition, was near
at hand--we were approaching the Holy Land ! Such a
burrowing into the hold for trunks that had lain buried for
weeks,  yes for months; such a hurrying to and fro above
decks and below; such a riotous system of packing and
unpacking; such a littering up of the cabins with shirts and
skirts,  and indescribable and unclassable odds and ends; such
a making up of bundles, and setting apart of umbrellas, green
spectacles and thick veils; such a critical inspection of saddles
and bridles that had never yet touched horses; such a cleaning
and loading of revolvers and examining of bowie-knives; such
a half-soling of the seats of pantaloons with serviceable
buckskin; then such a poring over ancient maps; such a
reading up of Bibles and Palestine travels; such a marking out
of routes; such exasperating efforts to divide up the company
into little bands of congenial spirits who might make the long
and arduous Journey without quarreling; and morning, noon
and night, such mass-meetings in the cabins, such speech-making, such sage suggesting, such
worrying and quarreling,
and such a general raising of the very mischief, was never seen
in the ship before!<p>

               <p>  But it is all over now. We are cut up into parties of six or
eight, and by this time are scattered far and wide. Ours is the
only one, however, that is venturing on what is called " the
long trip " --that is, out into Syria, by Baalbec to Damascus,
and thence down through the full length of Palestine. It would
be a tedious, and also a too risky journey, at this hot 

<hr><i>Page 432</i><br> 

season of the year, for any but strong, healthy men, accustomed somewhat to fatigue and rough
life in the open air. The
other parties will take shorter journeys.</p>

                <p>   For the last two months we have been in a worry about
one portion of this Holy Land pilgrimage. I refer to
transportation service. We knew very well that Palestine was
a country which did not do a large passenger business, and
every man we came across who knew any thing about it gave 
us to understand that not half of our party would be able to get
dragomen and animals. At Constantinople every body fell to
telegraphing  the American Consuls at Alexandria and
Beirout to give notice that we wanted dragomen and
transportation. We were desperate --would take horses,
jackasses, cameleopards, kangaroos --any thing. At Smyrna,
more telegraphing was done, to the same end.  Alsa fearing
for the worst, we telegraphed for a large number of seats in
the diligence for Damascus, and horses for the ruins of
Baalbec.</p>

                   <p>  As might have been expected, a notion got abroad in Syria
and Egypt that the whole population of the Province of
America (the Turks consider us a trifling little province in
some unvisited corner of the world,) were coming to the Holy
Land-- and so, when we got to Beirout yesterday, we found
the place full of dragomen and their outfits. We had all
intended to go by diligence to Damascus, and switch off  to
Baalbec as we went along --because we expected to rejoin the
ship, go to Monnt Carmel, and take to the woods from there.
However, when our own private party of eight found that it
was possible, and proper enough, to make the "long trip," we
adopted that programme. We have never been much trouble
to a Consul before, but we have been a fearful nuisance to our
Consul at Beirout. I mention this because I can not help
admiring his patience, his industry, and his accommodating
spirit. I mention it also, because I think some of our ship's
company did not give him as full credit for his excellent
services as he deserved.</p>

               <p>  Well, out of our eight, three were selected to attend to all
business connected with the expedition. The rest of us had 

<hr><i>Page 433</i><br>

nothing to do but look at the beautiful city of Beirout, with its bright,
new houses nestled among a wilderness of green shrubbery spread
abroad over an upland that sloped gently down to the sea; and also
at the mountains of Lebanon that environ it; and likewise to bathe
in the transparent blue water that rolled its billows about the ship
(we did not know there were sharks there.) We had also to range up
and down through the town and look at the costumes. These are
picturesque and fanciful, but not so varied as at Constantinople and
Smyrna; the women of Beirout add an agony --in the two former
cities the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through (and they
often expose their ancles,) but at Beirout they cover their entire
faces with dark-colored or black veils, so that they look like
mummies, and then expose their breasts to the public. A young
gentleman (I believe he was a Greek,) volunteered to show us
around the city, and said it would afford him great pleasure, because
he was studying English and wanted practice in that language.
When we had finished the rounds, however, he called for
remuneration --said he hoped the gentlemen would give him a trifle
in the way of a few piastres (equivalent to a few five cent pieces.)
We did so. The Consu1 was surprised when he heard it, and said he
knew the young fellow's family  very  well, and that they were an old
and highly respectable f'amily and worth a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars! Some people, so situated, would have been
ashamed of the berth he had with us and his manner of crawling into
it.</p>

<p>At the appointed time our businees committee reported, and said
all things were in readdress-- that we were to start to-day, with
horses, pack animals, and tents, and go to Baalbec, Damascus, the
Sea of Tiberias, and thence southward by the way of the scene of
Jacob's Dream and other notable Bible localities to
Jerusalem --from thence probably to the Dead Sea, but possibly
not-- and then strike for the ocean and rejoin the ship three or four
weeks hence at Joppa; terms, five dollars a day apiece, in gold, and
every thing to be furnished by the dragoman. They said we would
lie as well as at a hotel. I had read something like that before, and
did not shame my  judgment

              





<hr><i>Page 434</i><br>

by believing a word of it. I said nothing, however, but packed
up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in, pipes and tobacco, two or
three woollen shirts, a portfolio, a guide-book, and a Bible. I also
took along a towel and a cake of soap, to inspire respect in the
Arabs, who would take me for a king in disguise.</p>

<p>We were to select our horses at 3 P.M.  At that 
hour Abraham, the dragoman, marshaled them before us.  With
all solemnity I set it down here, that those horses were the
hardest lot I ever did come across, and their  accoutrements were
in exquisite keeping with
their style.

One brute had an eye out; another had his tail sawed off close,
like a rabbit, and was proud of it; another had a bony ridge
running from his neck to his tail, like one of those ruined
aqueducts one sees about Rome, and had a neck on him like
a bowsprit; they all limped, and had sore backs, and likewise
raw places and old scales scattered about their persons like
brass nails in a hair trunk; their gaits were marvelous to
contemplate, and replete with variety under way the procession
looked like a fleet in a storm. It was fearful. Blucher
shook his head and said:

<hr><i>Page 435</i><br>


"That dragon is going to get himself into trouble fetching
these old crates out of the hospital the way they are, unless he
has got a permit."</p>

                <p>I said nothing. The display was exactly according to the
guide-book, and were we not traveling by the guide-book ? I
selected a certain horse because I thought I saw him shy, and
I thought that a horse that had spirit enough to shy was not to
be despised.</p>

                    <p>At 6 o'clock P.M., we came to a halt here on the breezy
summit of a shapely mountain overlooking the sea, and
the handsome valley where dwelt some of those
enterprising Phoenicians of ancient times we read so much
about; all around us are what were once the dominions of
Hiram, King of Tyre, who furnished timber from the cedars of
these Lebanon hills to build portions of Eing Solomon's
Temple with.</p>

             <p>Shortly after six, our pack train arrived. I had not seen it
before, and a good right I had to be astonished. We had
nineteen serving men and twenty-six pack mules! It was a
perfect caravan. It looked like one, too, as it wound among the
rocks. I wondered what in the very mischief we wanted with
such a vast turn-out as that, for eight men. I wondered awhile,
but soon I began to long for a tin plate, and some bacon and
beans. I had camped out many and many a time before, and
knew just what was coming. I went off, without waiting for
serving men, and unsaddled my horse, and washed such
portions of his ribs and his spine as projected through his
hide, and when I came back, behold five stately circus tents
were up --tents that were brilliant, within, with blue, and
gold, and crimson, and all manner of splendid adornment! I
was speechless. Then they brought eight little iron bedsteads,
and set them up in the tents; they  put a soft mattress and
pillows and good blankets and two snow-white sheets on each
bed. Next, they rigged a table about the centre-pole, and on it
placed pewter pitchers, basins, soap, and the whitest of
towels-- one set for each man; they pointed to pockets in the
tent, and said we could put our small trifles in them for
convenience, and if we needed pins or such things, they were
sticking every 

<hr>Mi>Page 436</i><br> 

where. Then came the finishing touch --they spread carpets on
the floor ! I simply said, " If you call this camping out, all
right--but it isn't the style I am used to; my little baggage that I
brought along is at a discount."</p>

                    <p>It grew dark, and they put candles on the tables --candles
set in bright, new, brazen candlesticks. And soon the bell-- a 
genuine, simon-pure bell-- rang, and we were invited to " the
saloon." I had thought before that we had a tent or so too many,
but now here was one, at least, provided for; it was to be used for
nothing but an eating-saloon. Like the others, it was high enough
for a family of giraffes to live in, and was very handsome and
clean and bright-colored within. It was a gem of a place. A table
for eight, and eight canvas chairs; a table-cloth and napkins whose
whiteness and whose fineness laughed to scorn the things we were
used to in the great excursion steamer; knives and forks, soup-plates, dinner-plates --every thing,
in the handsomest kind of
style. It was wonderful! And they call <i>this</i> camping out. Those
stately fellows in baggy trowsers and turbaned fezzes brought in
a dinner which consisted of roast mutton, roast chicken, roast
goose, 

<hr><i>Page 437</i><br>

potatoes, bread, tea, pudding, apples, and delicious grapes; the
viands were better cooked than any we had eaten for weeks,
and the table made a finer appearance, with its large German
silver candlesticks and other finery, than any table we had sat
down to for a good while, and yet that polite dragoman,
Abraham, came bowing in and apologizing for the whole
affair, on account of the unavoidable confusion of getting
under way for a very long trip, and promising to do a great
deal better in future !</p>

                  <p>It is midnight, now, and we break camp at six in the morning.</p>

             <p>They call this camping out. At this rate it is a glorious
privilege to be a pilgrim to the Holy Land.</p>
