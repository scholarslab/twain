<hr><i>page 32</i><br>
All day Sunday at anchor.  The storm had gone down a
great deal, but the sea had not.  It was still piling its frothy hills high in
air "outside," as we could plainly see with the glasses. We could not properly
begin a pleasure excursion on Sunday; we could not offer untried stomachs to so
pitiless a sea as that.  We must lie still till Monday.  And we did.  But we
had repetitions of church and prayer-meetings; and so, of course, we were just
as eligibly situated as we could have been any where.<p>
I was up early that Sabbath morning and was early to breakfast.  I felt a
perfectly natural desire to have a good, long, unprejudiced look at the
passengers at a time when they should be free from self-consciousness--which is
at breakfast, when such a moment occurs in the lives of human beings at all.<p>
I was greatly surprised to see so many elderly people--I might almost say, so
many venerable people.  A glance at the long lines of heads was apt to make one
think it was <i>all</i> gray.  But it was not.  There was a tolerably fair sprinkling
of young folks, and another fair sprinkling of gentlemen and ladies who were
non-committal as to age, being neither actually old or absolutely young.<p>
The next morning we weighed anchor and went to sea.  It was a great happiness
to get away after this dragging, dispiriting delay.  I thought there never was
such gladness in the air before, such brightness in the sun, such beauty in the
<hr><i>page 33</i><br>
sea.  I was satisfied with the picnic then and with all its belongings.  AU my
malicious instincts were dead within me; and as America faded out of sight, I
think a spirit of charity rose up in their place that was as boundless, for the
time being, as the broad ocean that was heaving its billows about us.  I wished
to express my feelings--I wished to lift up my voice and sing; but I did not
know anything to sing, and so I was obliged to give up the idea.  It was no
loss to the ship, though, perhaps.<p>
It was breezy and pleasant, but the sea was still very rough.  One could not
promenade without risking his neck; at one moment the bowsprit was taking a
deadly aim at the sun in midheaven, and at the next it was trying to harpoon a
shark in the bottom of the ocean.  What a weird sensation it is to feel the
stem of a ship sinking swiftly from under you and see the bow climbing high
away among the clouds! One's safest course that day was to clasp a railing and
hang on; walking was too precarious a pastime.<p>
By some happy fortune I was not seasick.--That was a thing to be proud of.  I
had not always escaped before.  If there is one thing in the world that will
make a man peculiarly and insufferably self-conceited, it is to have his
stomach behave itself, the first day it sea, when nearly all his comrades are
seasick.  Soon a venerable fossil, shawled to the chin and bandaged like a
mummy, appeared at the door of the after deckhouse, and the next lurch of the
ship shot him into my arms.  I said:<p>
"Good-morning, Sir.  It is a fine day."<p>
He put his hand on his stomach and said, "<i>Oh</i>, my!" and then staggered
away and fell over the coop of a skylight.<p>
Presently another old gentleman was projected from the same door with great
violence.  I said:<p>
"Calm yourself, Sir--There is no hurry.  It is a fine day, Sir."<p>
He, also, put his hand on his stomach and said "<i>Oh</i>, my!" and reeled
away.<p>
<hr><i>page 34</i><br>
In a little while another veteran was discharged abruptly from the same door,
clawing at the air for a saving support I said:<p>
"Good morning, Sir.  It is a fine day for pleasuring.  You were about to
say--"<p>
"<i>Oh</i>, my!"<p>
I thought so.  I anticipated <i>him</i>, anyhow.  I stayed there and was
bombarded with old gentlemen for an hour, perhaps; and all I got out of any of
them was "<i>Oh</i>, my!"<p>
I went away then in a thoughtful mood.  I said, this is a good pleasure
excursion.  I like it.  The passengers are not garrulous, but still they are
sociable.  I like those old people, 
<hr><i>page 35</i><br>
but somehow they all seem to have the "Oh,
my" rather bad.<p>
I knew what was the matter with them.  They were seasick.  And I was glad of
it.  We all like to see people seasick when we are not, ourselves.  Playing
whist by the cabin lamps when it is storming outside is pleasant; walking the
quarterdeck in the moonlight is pleasant; smoking in the breezy foretop is
pleasant when one is not afraid to go up there; but these are all feeble and
commonplace compared with the joy of seeing people suffering the miseries of
seasickness.<p>
I picked up a good deal of information during the afternoon.  At one time I was
climbing up the quarterdeck when the vessel's stem was in the sky; I was
smoking a cigar and feeling passably comfortable.  Somebody ejaculated:<p>
"Come, now, <i>that </i>won't answer.  Read the sign up there--<i>NO SMOKING
ABAFT THE WHEEL</i>!"<p>
It was Captain Duncan, chief of the expedition.  I went forward, of course.  I
saw a long spyglass lying on a desk in one of the upper-deck state-rooms back of
the pilot-house and reached after it--there was a ship in the distance.<p>
"Ah, ah--hands off!  Come out of that!"<p>
I came out of that.  I said to a deck-sweep--but in a low voice:<p>
"Who is that overgrown pirate with the whiskers and the discordant voice?"<p>
"It's Captain Bursley--executive officer--sailing master."<p>
I loitered about awhile, and then, for want of something better to do, fell to
carving a railing with my knife.  Somebody said, in an insinuating, admonitory
voice:<p>
"Now, <i>say</i>--my friend--don't you know any better than to be whittling the
ship all to pieces that way?  <i>You </i>ought to know better than that."<p>
I went back and found the deck sweep.<p>
"Who is that smooth-faced, animated outrage yonder in the fine clothes?"<p>
"That's Captain L****, the owner of the ship--he's one of the main bosses."<p>
<hr><i>page 36</i><br>
In the course of time I brought up on the starboard side of the pilot-house and
found a sextant lying on a bench.  Now, I said, they "take the sun" through
this thing; I should think I might see that vessel through it.  I had hardly
got it to my eye when someone touched me on the shoulder and said
deprecatingly:<p>
"I'll have to get you to give that to me, Sir.  If there's anything you'd like
to know about taking the sun, I'd as soon tell you as not--but I don't like to
trust anybody with that instrument.  If you want any figuring done-- Aye, aye,
sir!"<p>
He was gone to answer a call from the other side.  I sought the deck-sweep.<p>
"Who is that spider-legged gorilla yonder with the sanctimonious
countenance?"<p>
"It's Captain Jones, sir--the chief mate."<p>
<hr><i>page 37</i><br>
"Well.  This goes clear away ahead of anything I ever heard of before.  Do
you--now I ask you as a man and a brother <i>--do </i>you think I could venture
to throw a rock here in any given direction without hitting a captain of this
ship?"<p>
"Well, sir, I don't know--I think likely you'd fetch the captain of the watch
may be, because he's a-standing right yonder in the way."<p>
I went below--meditating and a little downhearted.  I thought, if five cooks
can spoil a broth, what may not five captains do with a pleasure
excursion.
