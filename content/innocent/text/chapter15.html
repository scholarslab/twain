<hr><i>page 139</i><br>
One of our pleasantest visits was to P&egrave;re la
Chaise, the national burying ground of France, the honored resting place of
some of her greatest and best children, the last home of scores of illustrious
men and women who were born to no titles, but achieved fame by their own energy
and their own genius.  It is a solemn city of winding streets and of miniature
marble temples and mansions of the dead gleaming white from out a wilderness of
foliage and fresh flowers.  Not every city is so well peopled as this or has so
ample an area within its walls.  Few palaces exist in any city that are so
exquisite in design, so rich in art, so costly in material, so graceful, so
beautiful.<p>
We had stood in the ancient church of St. Denis, where the marble effigies of
thirty generations of kings and queens lay stretched at length upon the tombs,
and the sensations invoked were startling and novel; the curious armor, the
obsolete costumes, the placid faces, the hands placed palm to palm in eloquent
supplication--it was a vision of gray antiquity.  It seemed curious enough to
be standing face to face, as it were, with old Dagobert I, and Clovis and
Charlemagne, those vague, colossal heroes, those shadows, those myths of a
thousand years ago!  I touched their dust-covered faces with my finger, but
Dagobert was deader than the sixteen centuries that have passed over him,
Clovis slept well after his labor for Christ, and old Charlemagne went on
dreaming of his paladins, of bloody Roncesvalles, and gave no heed to me.<p>
<hr><i>page 140</i><br>
The great names of P&egrave;re la Chaise impress one, too, but differently.
There the suggestion brought constantly to his mind is that this place is
sacred to a nobler royalty--the royalty of heart and brain.  Every faculty of
mind, every noble trait of human nature, every high occupation which men engage
in, seems represented by a famous name.  The effect is a curious medley.
Davoust and Massena, who wrought in many a battle tragedy, are here, and so
also is Rachel, of equal renown in mimic tragedy on the stage.  The Abb&eacute;
Sicard sleeps here--the first great teacher of the deaf and dumb--a man whose
heart went out to every unfortunate, and whose life was given to kindly offices
in their service; and not far off, in repose and peace at last, lies Marshal
Ney, whose stormy spirit knew no music like the bugle call to arms.  The man
who originated public gas-lighting, and that other benefactor who introduced
the cultivation of the potato and thus blessed millions of his starving
countrymen, lie with the Prince of Masserano, and with exiled queens and
princes of Further India.  Gay-Lussac the chemist, Laplace the astronomer,
Larrey the surgeon, De Seze the advocate, are here, and with them are Talma,
Bellini, Rubini; de Balzac, Beaumarchais, Beranger; Moli&egrave;re and La
Fontaine, and scores of other men whose names and whose worthy labors are as
familiar in the remote byplaces of civilization as are the historic deeds of
the kings and princes that sleep in the marble vaults of St. Denis.<p>
But among the thousands and thousands of tombs in P&egrave;re la Chaise, there
is one that no man, no woman, no youth of either sex, ever passes by without
stopping to examine.  Every visitor has a sort of indistinct idea of the
history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there, but not one in
twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb and its romantic
occupants.  This is the grave of Abelard and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se a grave which
has been more revered, more widely known, more written and sung about and wept
over, for seven hundred years, than any other in Christendom save only that of
the Saviour.  All visitors linger pensively about <hr><i>page
141</i><br>
it; all young people capture
and carry away keepsakes and mementos of it; all Parisian youths and maidens
who are disappointed in love come there to bail out when they are full of
tears; yea, many stricken lovers make pilgrimages to this shrine from distant
provinces to weep and wail and "grit" their teeth over their heavy sorrows, and
to purchase the sympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings
of immortelles and budding flowers.<p>
Go when you will, you find somebody snuffling over that tomb.  Go when you
will, you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles.  Go when you
will, you find a gravel train from Marseilles arriving to supply the
deficiencies caused by memento-cabbaging vandals whose affections have
miscarried.<p>
Yet who really knows the story of Abelard and H&eacute;lo&iuml;se?  Precious
few people.  The names are perfectly familiar to everybody, and that is about
all.  With infinite pains I have acquired a knowledge of that history, and I
propose to narrate it here, partly for the honest information of the public and
partly to show that public that they have been wasting a good deal of
marketable sentiment very unnecessarily.
<center><H3>STORY OF ABELARD AND HELOISE</H3></center>
Heloise was born seven hundred and sixty-six years ago.
<hr><i>page 142</i><br>She may
have had parents.  There is no telling.  She lived with her uncle Fulbert, a
canon of the cathedral of Paris.  I do not know what a canon of a cathedral is,
but that is what he was.  He was nothing more than a sort of a mountain
howitzer, likely, because they had no heavy artillery in those days.  Suffice
it, then, that Heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and was
happy.  She spent the most of her childhood in the convent of Argenteuil--never
heard of Argenteuil before, but suppose there was really such a place.  She
then returned to her uncle, the old gun, or son of a gun, as the case may be,
and he taught her to write and speak Latin, which was the language of
literature and polite society at that period.<p>
Just at this time, Pierre Abelard, who had already made himself widely famous
as a rhetorician, came to found a school of rhetoric in Paris.  The originality
of his principles, his eloquence, and his great physical strength and beauty
created a profound sensation.  He saw Heloise, and was captivated
by her blooming youth, her beauty, and her charming disposition.  He wrote to
her; she answered.  He wrote again; she answered again.  He was now in love.
He longed to know her--to speak to her face to face.<p>
His school was near Fulbert's house.  He asked Fulbert to allow him to call.
The good old swivel saw here a rare opportunity: his niece, whom he so much
loved, would absorb knowledge from this man, and it would not cost him a cent.
Such was Fulbert--penurious.<p>
Fulbert's first name is not mentioned by any author, which
<Hr><i>page 143</i><br>is unfortunate.
However, George W. Fulbert will answer for him as well as any other.  We will
let him go at that.  He asked Abelard to teach her.<p>
Abelard was glad enough of the opportunity.  He came often and stayed long.  A
letter of his shows in its very first sentence that he came under that friendly
roof like a cold-hearted villain as he was, with the deliberate intention of
debauching a confiding, innocent girl.  This is the letter:
<BLOCKQUOTE><font size=2>
"I cannot cease to be astonished at the simplicity of Fulbert; I was as much
surprised as if he had placed a lamb in the power of a hungry wolf.
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se and I, under pretext of study, gave ourselves up wholly to
love, and the solitude that love seeks our studies procured for us.  Books were
open before us, but we spoke oftener of love than philosophy, and kisses came
more readily from our lips than words."
</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
And so, exulting over an honorable confidence which to his degraded instinct
was a ludicrous "simplicity," this unmanly Abelard seduced the niece of the man
whose guest he was.  Paris found it out.  Fulbert was told of it--told
often--but refused to believe it.  He could not comprehend how a man could be
so depraved as to use the sacred protection and security of hospitality as a
means for the commission of such a crime as that.  But when he heard the
rowdies in the streets singing the lovesongs of Abelard to Heloise,
the case was too plain--lovesongs come not properly within the teachings of
rhetoric and philosophy.<p>
He drove Abelard from his house.  Abelard returned secretly and carried
Heloise away to Palais, in Brittany, his native country.  Here,
shortly afterward, she bore a son, who, from his rare beauty, was surnamed
Astrolabe--William G. The girl's flight enraged Fulbert, and he longed for
vengeance, but feared to strike lest retaliation visit Heloise--for
he still loved her tenderly.  At length Abelard offered to marry
Heloise--but on a shameful condition: that the marriage should be
kept secret from the world, to the end that (while her good name remained a
wreck, as before) his priestly reputation might be kept untarnished.  It was
like that miscreant.  Fulbert saw his opportunity and consented.  He
would see<hr><i>page 144</i><br>
the parties married and then violate the confidence of the man who had taught
him that trick; he would divulge the secret and so remove somewhat of the
obloquy that attached to his niece's fame.  But the niece suspected his scheme.
She refused the marriage at <i>first; </i>she said Fulbert would betray the
secret to save her, and besides, she did not wish to drag down a lover who was
so gifted, so honored by the world, and who had such a splendid career before
him.  It was noble, self-sacrificing love, and characteristic of the
pure-souled Heloise, but it was not good sense.<p>
But she was overruled, and the private marriage took place.  Now for Fulbert!
The heart so wounded should be healed at last; the proud spirit so tortured
should find rest again; the humbled head should be lifted up once more. He
proclaimed the marriage in the high places of the city and rejoiced that
dishonor had departed from his house.  But lo! Abelard denied the marriage!
Heloise denied it! The people, knowing the former circumstances,
might have believed Fulbert had only Abelard denied it, but when the person
chiefly interested--the girl herself--denied it, they laughed, despairing
Fulbert to scorn.<p>
<hr><i>page 145</i><br>
The poor canon of the cathedral of Paris was spiked again.  The last hope of
repairing the wrong that had been done his house was gone.  What next?  Human
nature suggested revenge.  He compassed it.  The historian says:
<BLOCKQUOTE><font size=2>
"Ruffians, hired by Fulbert, fell upon Abelard by night, and
inflicted upon him a terrible and nameless mutilation."
</font></BLOCKQUOTE>
I am seeking the last resting place of those "ruffians." When I find it I shall
shed some tears on it, and stack up some bouquets and immortelles, and cart
away from it some gravel whereby to remember that howsoever blotted by crime
their lives may have been, these ruffians did one just deed, at any rate,
albeit it was not warranted by the strict letter of the law.<p>
Heloise entered a convent and gave good-bye to the world and its
pleasures for all time.  For twelve years she never heard of Abelard--never
even heard his name mentioned.  She had become prioress of Argenteuil and led a
life of complete seclusion.  She happened one day to see a letter written by
him, in which he narrated his own history.  She cried over it and wrote him.
He answered, addressing her as his "sister in Christ." They continued to
correspond, she in the unweighed language of unwavering affection, he in the
chilly phraseology of the polished rhetorician.  She poured out her heart in
passionate, disjointed sentences; he replied with finished essays, divided
deliberately into heads and subheads, premises and argument.  She showered upon
him the tenderest epithets that love could devise, he addressed her from the
North PoIe of his frozen heart as the "Spouse of Christ"! The abandoned
villain!<p>
On account of her too easy government of her nuns, some disreputable
irregularities were discovered among them, and the Abbot of St. Denis broke up
her establishment.  Abelard was the official head of the monastery of St.
Gildas de Ruys at that time, and when he heard of her homeless condition a
sentiment of pity was aroused in his breast (it is a wonder the unfamiliar
emotion did not blow his head off ), and he placed <hr><i>page
146</i><br>
her and her troop in the
little oratory of the Paraclete, a religious establishment which he had
founded.  She had many privations and sufferings to undergo at first, but her
worth and her gentle disposition won influential friends for her, and she built
up a wealthy and flourishing nunnery.  She became a great favorite with the
heads of the church, and also the people, though she seldom appeared in public.
She rapidly advanced in esteem, in good report, and in usefulness, and Abelard
as rapidly lost ground.  The Pope so honored her that he made her the head of
her order.  Abelard, a man of splendid talents, and ranking as the first
debater of his time, became timid, irresolute, and distrustful of his powers.
He only needed a great misfortune to topple him from the high position he held
in the world of intellectual excellence, and it came.  Urged by kings and
princes to meet the subtle St. Bernard in debate and crush him, he stood up in
the presence of a royal and illustrious assemblage, and when his antagonist had
finished he looked about him and stammered a commencement; but his courage
failed him, the cunning of his tongue was gone; with his speech unspoken, he
trembled and sat down, a disgraced and vanquished champion.<p>
He died a nobody, and was buried at Cluny, A.D. 1144.  They removed his body to
the Paraclete afterward, and when Heloise died, twenty years later,
they buried her with him, in accordance with her last wish.  He died at the
ripe age of 64, and she at 63.  After the bodies had remained entombed three
hundred years, they were removed once more.  They were removed again in 1800,
and finally, seventeen years afterward, they were taken up and transferred to
P&eacute;re la Chaise, where they will remain in peace and quiet until it comes
time for them to get up and move again.<p>
History is silent concerning the last acts of the mountain howitzer.  Let the
world say what it will about him, I, at least, shall always respect the memory
and sorrow for the abused trust and the broken heart and the troubled spirit of
the old smooth bore.  Rest and repose be his!<p>
Such is the story of Abelard and Heloise.  Such is the
history<hr><i>page 147</i><br>
 that
Lamartine has shed such cataracts of tears over.  But that man never could come
within the influence of a subject in the least pathetic without overflowing his
banks.  He ought to be dammed--or leveed, I should more properly say.  Such is
the history--not as it is usually told, but as it is when stripped of the
nauseous sentimentality that would enshrine for our loving worship a dastardly
seducer like Pierre Abelard.  I have not a word to say against the misused,
faithful girl, and would not withhold from her grave a single one of those
simple tributes which blighted youths and maidens offer to her memory, but I am
sorry enough that I have not time and opportunity to write four or five volumes
of my opinion of her friend the founder of the Parachute, or the Paraclete, or
whatever it was.<p>
The tons of sentiment I have wasted on that unprincipled humbug in my
ignorance!  I shall throttle down my emotions hereafter, about this sort of
people, until I have read them up and know whether they are entitled to any
tearful attentions or not.  I wish I had my immortelles back now, and that
bunch of radishes.<p>
In Paris we often saw in shop windows the sign <i>"English Spoken Here,"
</i>just as one sees in the windows at home the sign <i>"Ici on parle
fran&ccedil;aise." </i>We always invaded these places at once--and invariably
received the information, framed in faultless French, that the clerk who did
the English for the establishment had just gone to dinner and would be back in
an hour.  Would monsieur buy something?  We wondered why those parties happened
to take their dinners at such erratic and extraordinary hours, for we never
called at a time when an exemplary Christian would be in the least likely to be
abroad on such an errand.  The truth was, it was a base fraud--a snare to trap
the unwary--chaff to catch fledglings with.  They had no English-murdering
clerk.  They trusted to the sign to inveigle foreigners into their lairs, and
trusted to their own blandishments to keep them there till they bought
something.<p>
We ferreted out another French imposition--a frequent
<hr><i>page 148</i><br>
 sign to this effect: "ALL
MANNER OF AMERICAN DRINKS ARTISTICALLY PREPARED HERE." We procured the services
of a gentleman experienced in the nomenclature of the American bar, and moved
upon the works of one of these impostors.  A bowing, aproned Frenchman skipped
forward and said:<p>
"Que voulez les messieurs?" I do not know what "Que voulez les
messieurs?" means, but such was his remark.<p>
Our general said, "We will take a whiskey straight."<p>
[A stare from the Frenchman.]<p>
"Well, if you don't know what that is, give us a champagne cocktail."<p>
[A stare and a shrug.]<p>
<hr><i>page 149</i><br>
"Well, then, give us a sherry cobbler."<p>
The Frenchman was checkmated.  This was all Greek to him.<p>
"Give us a brandy smash!"<p>
The Frenchman began to back away, suspicious of the ominous vigor of the last
order--began to back away, shrugging his shoulders and spreading his hands
apologetically.<p>
The general followed him up and gained a complete victory.  The uneducated
foreigner could not even furnish a Santa Cruz Punch, an Eye-Opener, a Stone
Fence, or an Earthquake.  It was plain that he was a wicked impostor.<p>
An acquaintance of mine said the other day that he was doubtless the only
American visitor to the Exposition who had had the high honor of being escorted
by the Emperor's bodyguard.  I said with unobtrusive frankness that I was
astonished that such a long-legged, lantern-jawed, unprepossessing-looking
specter as he should be singled out for a distinction like that, and asked how
it came about.  He said he had attended a great military review in the Champ de
Mars some time ago, and while the multitude about him was growing thicker and
thicker every moment he observed an open space inside the railing.  He left his
carriage and went into it.  He was the only person there, and so he had plenty
of room, and the situation being central, he could see all the preparations
going on about the field.  By and by there was a sound of music, and soon the
Emperor of the French and the Emperor of Austria, escorted by the famous
<i>Cent Gardes, </i>entered the enclosure.  They seemed not to observe him, but
directly, in response to a sign from the commander of the guard, a young
lieutenant came toward him with a file of his men following, halted, raised his
hand, and gave the military salute, and then said in a low voice that he was
sorry to have to disturb a stranger and a gentleman, but the place was sacred
to royalty.  Then this New Jersey phantom rose up and bowed and begged pardon,
then with the officer beside him, the file of men marching behind him, and with
every mark of respect, he was escorted to his carriage by the imperial <i>Cent
<hr><i>page 150</i><br>
Gardes!  </i>The officer saluted again and fell back, the New Jersey sprite
bowed in return and had presence of mind enough to pretend that he had simply
called on a matter of private business with those emperors, and so waved them
an adieu and drove from the field!<p>
Imagine a poor Frenchman ignorantly intruding upon a public rostrum sacred to
some sixpenny dignitary in America.  The police would scare him to death first
with a storm of their elegant blasphemy, and then pull him to pieces getting
him away from there.  We are measurably superior to the French in some things,
but they are immeasurably our betters in others.<p>
Enough of Paris for the present.  We have done our whole duty by it.  We have
seen the Tuileries, the Napoleon Column, the Madeleine, that wonder of wonders
the tomb of Napoleon, all the great churches and museums, libraries, imperial
palaces, and sculpture and picture galleries, the Pantheon, <i>Jardin des
Plantes,</i> the opera, the circus, the legislative body, the billiard rooms, the
barbers, the <i>grisettes--</i><p>
Ah, the <i>grisettes!</i>  I had almost forgotten.  They are another romantic fraud.
They were (if you let the books of travel tell it) always so beautiful--so neat
and trim, so graceful--so naive and trusting--so gentle, so winning--so
faithful to their shop duties, so irresistible to buyers in their prattling
importunity--so devoted to their poverty-stricken students of the Latin
Quarter--so lighthearted and happy on their Sunday picnics in the suburbs--and
oh, so charmingly, so delightfully immoral!<p>
Stuff! For three or four days I was constantly saying:<p>
<hr><i>page 151</i><br>
"Quick, Ferguson!  Is that a grisette?"<p>
And he always said, "No."<p>
He comprehended at last that I wanted to see a grisette.  Then he showed me
dozens of them.  They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw--homely.
They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general
thing, and moustaches that not even good breeding could overlook; they combed
their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not
winning, they were not graceful; I knew by their looks that they ate garlic and
onions; and lastly and finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to
call them immoral.<p>
Aroint thee, wench!  I sorrow for the vagabond student of the Latin Quarter
now, even more than formerly I envied him.  Thus topples to earth another idol
of my infancy.<p>
We have seen everything, and tomorrow we go to Versailles.  We shall see Paris
only for a little while as we come back to take up our line of march for the
ship, and so I may as well bid the beautiful city a regretful farewell.  We
shall travel many thousands of miles after we leave here and visit many great
cities, but we shall find none so enchanting as this.<p>
<hr><i>page 152</i><br>
Some of our party have gone to England, intending to take a roundabout course
and rejoin the vessel at Leghorn or Naples several weeks hence.  We came near
going to Geneva, but have concluded to return to Marseilles and go up through
Italy from Genoa.<p>
I will conclude this chapter with a remark that I am sincerely proud to be able
to make--and glad, as well, that my comrades cordially endorse it, to wit: by
far the handsomest women we have seen in France were born and reared in
America.<p>
I feel now like a man who has redeemed a failing reputation and shed luster
upon a dimmed escutcheon by a single just deed done at the eleventh hour.<p>
Let the curtain fall, to slow music.
