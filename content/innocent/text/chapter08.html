This is royal! Let those who went up through Spain make
the best of it--these dominions of the Emperor of Morocco suit our little party
well enough.  We have had enough of Spain at Gibraltar for the present.
Tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time.  Elsewhere we have
found foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people, but always with things
and people intermixed that we were familiar with before, and so the novelty of
the situation lost a deal of its force.  We wanted something thoroughly and
uncompromisingly foreign--foreign from top to bottom--foreign from center to
circumference--foreign inside and outside and all around--nothing anywhere
about it to dilute its foreignness--nothing to remind us of any other people or
any other land under the sun.  And lo! In Tangier we have found it.  Here is
not the slightest thing that ever we have seen save in pictures--and we always
mistrusted the pictures before.  We cannot anymore.  The pictures used to seem
exaggerations--they seemed too weird and fanciful for reality.  But behold,
they were not wild enough--they were not fanciful enough--they have not told
half the story.  Tangier is a foreign land if ever there was one, and the true
spirit of it can never be found in any book save <i>The Arabian Nights.
</i>Here are no white men visible, yet swarms of humanity are all about us.
Here is a packed and jammed city enclosed in a massive stone wall which is more
than a thousand years old.  All the houses nearly are one- and two-story, made
of thick walls of stone, plastered outside, square as a dry-goods box, flat as
a floor on
<hr><i>page 77</i><br>
top, no cornices, whitewashed all over--a crowded city of snowy
tombs!  And the doors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in Moorish
pictures; the floors are laid in varicolored diamond flags; in tesselated,
many-colored porcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of Fez; in red tiles and
broad bricks that time cannot wear; there is no furniture in the rooms (of
Jewish dwellings) save divans--what there is in Moorish ones no man may know;
within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter.  And the streets are
oriental--some of them three feet wide, some six, but only two that are over a
dozen; a man can blockade the most of them by extending his body across them.
Isn't it an oriental picture?<p>
There are stalwart Bedouins of the desert here, and stately Moors proud of a
history that goes back to the night of time; and Jews whose fathers fled hither
centuries upon centuries ago; and swarthy Riffians from the mountains--born
cutthroats
<hr><i>page 78 </i><br>
--and original, genuine Negroes as black as Moses; and howling
dervishes and a hundred breeds of Arabs--an sorts and descriptions of people
that are foreign and curious to look upon.<p>
And their dresses are strange beyond all description.  Here is a bronzed Moor
in a prodigious white turban, curiously embroidered jacket, gold and crimson
sash, of many folds, wrapped round and round his waist, trousers that only come
a little below his knee and yet have twenty yards of stuff in them, ornamented
scimitar, bare shins, stockingless feet, yellow slippers, and gun of
preposterous length--a mere soldier!--I thought he was the Emperor at least.
And here are aged Moors with flowing white beards and long white robes with
vast cowls; and Bedouins with long, cowled, striped cloaks; and Negroes and
Riffians with heads clean-shaven except a kinky scalp lock back of the ear or,
rather, upon the aftercorner of the skull; and all sorts of barbarians in all
sorts of weird costumes, and all more or less ragged.  And here are Moorish
women who are enveloped from head to foot in coarse white robes, and whose sex
can only be determined by the fact that they only leave one eye visible and
never look at men of their own race, or are looked at by them in public.  Here
are five thousand Jews in blue gabardines, sashes about their waists, slippers
upon their feet, little skullcaps upon the backs of their heads, hair combed
down on the forehead, and cut straight across the middle of it from side to
side--the selfsame fashion their Tangier ancestors have worn for I don't know
how many bewildering centuries.  Their feet and ankles are bare.  Their noses
are all hooked, and hooked alike.  They all resemble each other so much that
one could almost believe they were of one family.  Their women are plump and
pretty, and do smile upon a Christian in a way which is in the last degree
comforting.<p>
What a funny old town it is! It seems like profanation to laugh and jest and
bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics.  Only the stately
phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the Prophet are suited to a
venerable
<hr><i>page 79</i><br>
antiquity like this.  Here is a crumbling wall that was old when
Columbus discovered America; was old when Peter the Hermit roused the knightly
men of the Middle Ages to arm for the first Crusade; was old when Charlemagne
and his paladins beleaguered enchanted castles and battled with giants and
genii in the fabled days of the olden time; was old when Christ and his
disciples walked the earth; stood where it stands today when the lips of Memnon
were vocal and men bought and sold in the streets of ancient Thebes!<p>
The Phoenicians, the Carthagenians, the English, Moors, Romans, all have
battled for Tangier--all have won it and lost it.  Here is a ragged,
oriental-looking Negro from some desert place in interior Africa, filling his
goatskin with water from a stained and battered fountain built by the Romans
twelve hundred years ago.  Yonder is a ruined arch of a bridge built by Julius
Caesar nineteen hundred years ago.  Men who had seen the infant Saviour in the
Virgin's arms have stood upon it, maybe.<p>
Near it are the ruins of a dockyard where Caesar repaired his ships and loaded
them with grain when he invaded Britain, fifty years before the Christian
era.<p>
Here, under the quiet stars, these old streets seem thronged with the phantoms
of forgotten ages.  My eyes are resting upon a spot where stood a monument
which was seen and described by Roman historians less than two thousand years
ago, whereon was inscribed:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WE ARE THE CANAANITES.  WE ARE THEY THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT
OF THE LAND OF CANAAN BY THE JEWISH ROBBER, JOSHUA.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Joshua drove them out, and they came here.  Not many leagues from here is a
tribe of Jews whose ancestors fled thither after an unsuccessful revolt against
King David, and these their descendants are still under a ban and keep to
themselves.<p>
Tangier has been mentioned in history for three thousand years.  And it was a
town, though a queer one, when Hercules,
<hr><i>page 80</i><br>
 clad in his lion skin, landed here,
four thousand years ago.  In these streets he met Anitus, the king of the
country, and brained him with his club, which was the fashion among gentlemen
in those days.  The people of Tangier (called Tingis then) lived in the rudest
possible huts and dressed in skins and carried clubs, and were as savage as the
wild beasts they were constantly obliged to war with.  But they were a
gentlemanly race and did no work.  They lived on the natural products of the
land.  Their king's country residence was at the famous Garden of Hesperides,
seventy miles down the coast from here.  The garden, with its golden apples
(oranges), is gone now--no vestige of it remains.  Antiquarians concede that
such a personage as Hercules did exist in ancient times and agree that he was
an enterprising and energetic man, but decline to believe him a good, bona-fide
god, because that would be unconstitutional.<p>
Down here at Cape Spartel is the celebrated cave of Hercules, where that hero
took refuge when he was vanquished and driven out of the Tangier country.  It
is full of inscriptions in the dead languages, which fact makes me think
Hercules could not have traveled much, else he would not have kept a journal.<p>
Five days' journey from here--say two hundred miles--are the ruins of an
ancient city, of whose history there is neither record nor tradition.  And yet
its arches, its columns, and its statues proclaim it to have been built by an
enlightened race.<p>
The general size of a store in Tangier is about that of an ordinary shower bath
in a civilized land.  The Muhammadan merchant, tinman, shoemaker, or vendor of
trifles sits cross-legged on the floor and reaches after any article you may
want to buy.  You can rent a whole block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars
a month.  The market people crowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs,
dates, melons, apricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not
much larger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog.  The scene is lively, is
picturesque, and smells like a police court.  The Jewish money-
<hr><i>page 81</i><br>
changers have
their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coins and
transferring them from one bushel basket to another.  They don't coin much
money nowadays, I think.  I saw none but what was dated four or five hundred
years back, and was badly worn and battered.  These coins are not very
valuable.  Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to have money suited
to the general cheapness of things, and came back and said he bad "swamped the
bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, and the head of the firm had gone on
the street to negotiate for the balance of the change." I bought nearly half a
pint of their money for a shilling myself.  I am not proud on account of having
so much money, though.  I care nothing for wealth.<p>
The Moors have some small silver coins and also some silver slugs worth a
dollar each.  The latter are exceedingly scarce--so much so that when poor
ragged Arabs see one they beg to be allowed to kiss it.<p>
They have also a small gold coin worth two dollars.  And that reminds me of
something.  When Morocco is in a state of war, Arab couriers carry letters
through the country and charge a liberal postage.  Every now and then they fall
into the hands of marauding bands and get robbed.  Therefore, warned by
experience, as soon as they have collected two dollars' worth of money they
exchange it for one of those little gold pieces, and when robbers come upon
them, swallow it.  The stratagem was good while it was unsuspected, but after
that the marauders simply gave the sagacious United States mail an emetic and
sat down to wait.<p>
<hr><i>page 82</i><br>
The Emperor of Morocco is a soulless despot, and the great officers under him
are despots on a smaller scale.  There is no regular system of taxation, but
when the Emperor or the Bashaw want money, they levy on some rich man, and he
has to furnish the cash or go to prison.  Therefore, few men in Morocco dare to
be rich.  It is too dangerous a luxury.  Vanity occasionally leads a man to
display wealth, but sooner or later the Emperor trumps up a charge against
him--any sort of one will do--and confiscates his property.  Of course, there
are many rich men in the empire, but their money is buried, and they dress in
rags and counterfeit poverty.  Every now and then the Emperor imprisons a man
who is suspected of the crime of being rich, and makes things so uncomfortable
for him that he is forced to discover where he has hidden his money.<p>
Moors and Jews sometimes place themselves under the protection of the foreign
consuls, and then they can flout their riches in the Emperor's face with
impunity.
