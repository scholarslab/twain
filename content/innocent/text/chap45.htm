<h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER XLV.</h3>

<hr><i>Page 465</i><br>
<p>THE last twenty-four hours we staid in Damascus I lay prostrate with a
violent attack of cholera, or cholera morbus, and therefore had a good
chance and a good excuse to lie there on that wide divan and take an
honest rest. I had nothing to do but listen to the pattering of the
fountains and take medicine and throw it up again. It was dangerous
recreation, but it was pleasanter than traveling in Syria.  I had plenty
of snow from Mount Hermon, and as it would not stay on my stomach, there
was nothing to interfere with my eating it--there was always room for
more. I enjoyed myself very well. Syrian travel has its interesting
features, like travel in any other part of the world, and yet to break
your leg or have the cholera adds a welcome variety to it.

</p><p>We left Damascus at noon and rode across the plain a couple of
hours, and then the party stopped a while in the shade of some
fig-trees to give me a chance to rest. It was the hottest day we had seen
yet--the sun-flames shot down like the shafts of fire that stream out
before a blow-pipe--the rays seemed to fall in a steady deluge on the
head and pass downward like rain from a roof. I imagined I could
distinguish between the floods of rays--I thought I could tell when each
flood struck my head, when it reached my shoulders, and when the
next one came. It was terrible. All the desert glared so fiercely that my
eyes were swimming in tears all the time. The boys had white
umbrellas heavily lined with dark green. They were a priceless
blessing. I thanked fortune that I had one, too, notwithstanding it was
packed up with

<hr><i>Page 466</i><br>
the baggage and was ten miles ahead. It is madness to travel in Syria
without an umbrella. They told me in Beirout (these people who always
gorge you with advice) that it was madness to travel in Syria without an
umbrella. It was on this account that I got one.

</p><p>But, honestly, I think an umbrella is a nuisance any where when its
business is to keep the sun off. No Arab wears a brim to his fez, or uses
an umbrella, or any thing to shade his eyes or his face, and he always
looks comfortable and proper in the sun. But of all the ridiculous sights
I ever have seen, our party of eight is the most so--they do cut such an
outlandish figure. They travel single file; they all wear the endless
white rag of Constantinople wrapped round and round their hats and
dangling down their backs; they all wear thick green spectacles, with
side-glasses to them; they all hold white umbrellas, lined with green,
over their heads; without exception their stirrups are too short--they are
the very worst gang of horsemen on earth, their animals to a horse trot
fearfully hard--and when they get strung out one after the other; glaring
straight ahead and breathless; bouncing high and out of turn, all along
the

<hr><i>Page 467</i><br>
line; knees well up and stiff, elbows flapping like a rooster's that is
going to crow, and the long file of umbrellas popping  convulsively up
and down--when one sees this outrageous  picture exposed to the light of
day, he is amazed that the gods  don't get out their thunderbolts and
destroy them off the face of the earth! I do--I wonder at it. I wouldn't let
any such caravan go through a country of mine.

</p><p>And when the sun drops below the horizon and the boys  close their
umbrellas and put them under their arms, it is only a  variation of the
picture, not a modification of its absurdity.

</p><p>But may be you can not see the wild extravagance of my  panorama.
You could if you were here. Here, you feel all the  time just as if you were
living about the year 1200 before  Christ--or back to the patriarchs--or
forward to the New Era.  The scenery of the Bible is about you--the
customs of the  patriarchs are around you--the same people, in the same
flowing robes, and in sandals, cross your path--the same long  trains of
stately camels go and come--the same impressive  religious solemnity and
silence rest upon the desert and the  mountains that were upon them in the
remote ages of antiquity,  and behold, intruding upon a scene like this,
comes this fantastic  mob of green-spectacled Yanks, with their flapping
elbows and  bobbing umbrellas! It is Daniel in the lion's den with a green
cotton umbrella under his arm, all over again.

</p><p>My umbrella is with the baggage, and so are my green
spectacles--and there they shall stay. I will not use them. I will show
some respect for the eternal fitness of things. It will be bad enough to
get sun-struck, without looking ridiculous into the bargain. If I fall,
let me fall bearing about me the semblance of a <orig
reg="Christian">Christina</orig>, at least.

</p><p>Three or four hours out from Damascus we passed the spot where Saul
was so abruptly converted, and from this place we looked back over the
scorching desert, and had our last glimpse of beautiful Damascus, decked
in its robes of shining green.  After nightfall we reached our tents, just
outside of the nasty Arab village of Jonesborough. Of course the real name
of the place is El something or other, but the boys still refuse to

<hr><i>Page 468</i><br>
recognize the Arab names or try to pronounce them. When I say that
that village is of the usual style, I mean to insinuate that all Syrian
villages within fifty miles of Damascus are alike--so much alike that it
would require more than human intelligence to tell wherein one differed
from another. A Syrian village is a hive of huts one story high (the
height of a man,) and as square as a dry-goods box; it is mud-plastered
all over, flat roof and all, and generally whitewashed after a fashion.
The same roof often extends over half the town, covering many of the
<i>streets</i>, which are generally about a yard wide. When you ride
through
one of these villages at noon-day, you first meet a melancholy dog, that
looks up at you and silently begs that you won't run over him, but he
does not offer to get out of the way; next you meet a young boy
without any clothes on, and he holds out his hand and says
"Bucksheesh!"--he don't really expect a cent, but then he learned to say that
before he learned to say mother, and now he can not break himself of
it; next you meet a woman with a black veil drawn closely over her
face, and her bust exposed; finally, you come to several sore-eyed
children and children in all stages of mutilation and decay; and sitting
humbly in the dust, and all fringed with filthy rags, is a poor devil
whose arms and legs are gnarled and twisted like grape-vines. These
are all the people you are likely to see. The balance of the population
are asleep within doors, or abroad tending goats in the plains and on
the hill-sides. The village is built on some consumptive little
water-course, and about it is a little fresh-looking vegetation. Beyond
this charmed circle, for miles on every side, stretches a weary desert of
sand and gravel, which produces a gray bunchy shrub like sage-brush.
A Syrian village is the sorriest sight in the world, and its surroundings
are eminently in keeping with it.

</p><p>I would not have gone into this dissertation upon Syrian villages
but for the fact that Nimrod, the Mighty Hunter of Scriptural notoriety,
is buried in Jonesborough, and I wished the public to know about how he is
located. Like Homer, he is said to be buried in many other places, but
this is the only true and genuine place his ashes inhabit.

<hr><i>Page 469</i><br>
</p><p>When the original tribes were dispersed, more than four thousand
years ago, Nimrod and a large party traveled three or four hundred
miles, and settled where the great city of Babylon afterwards stood.
Nimrod built that city. He also began to build the famous Tower of
Babel, but circumstances over which he had no control put it out of his
power to finish it. He ran it up eight stories high, however, and two of
them still stand, at this day--a colossal mass of brickwork, rent down
the centre by earthquakes, and seared and vitrified by the lightnings of
an angry God. But the vast ruin will still stand for ages, to shame the
puny labors of these modern generations of men. Its huge
compartments are tenanted by owls and lions, and old Nimrod lies
neglected in this wretched village, far from the scene of his grand
enterprise.

</p><p>We left Jonesborough very early in the morning, and rode forever
and forever and forever, it seemed to me, over parched deserts and
rocky hills, hungry, and with no water to drink. We had drained the
goat-skins dry in a little while. At noon we halted before the wretched
Arab town of El Yuba Dam, perched on the side of a mountain, but the
dragoman said if we applied there for water we would be attacked by
the whole tribe, for they did not love Christians. We had to journey on.
Two hours later we reached the foot of a tall isolated mountain, which
is crowned by the crumbling castle of Banias, the stateliest ruin of that
kind on earth, no doubt. It is a thousand feet long and two hundred
wide, all of the most symmetrical, and at the same time the most
ponderous masonry. The massive towers and bastions are more than
thirty feet high, and have been sixty. From the mountain's peak its
broken turrets rise above the groves of ancient oaks and olives, and
look wonderfully picturesque. It is of such high antiquity that no man
knows who built it or when it was built. It is utterly inaccessible, except
in one place, where a bridle-path winds upward among the solid rocks
to the old portcullis. The horses' hoofs have bored holes in these rocks
to the depth of six inches during the hundreds and hundreds of years
that the castle was garrisoned. We wandered for three hours

<hr><i>Page 470</i><br>
among the chambers and crypts and dungeons of the fortress, and trod
where the mailed heels of many a knightly Crusader had rang, and
where Phenician heroes had walked ages before them.

</p><p>We wondered how such a solid mass of masonry could be affected
even by an earthquake, and could not understand what agency had made
Banias a ruin; but we found the destroyer, after a while, and then our
wonder was increased tenfold. Seeds had fallen in crevices in the vast
walls; the seeds had sprouted; the tender, insignificant sprouts had
hardened; they grew larger and larger, and by a steady, imperceptible
pressure forced the great stones apart, and now are bringing sure
destruction upon a giant work that has even mocked the earthquakes to
scorn! Gnarled and twisted trees spring from the old walls every where,
and beautify and overshadow the gray battlements with a wild
luxuriance of foliage.

</p><p>From these old towers we looked down upon a broad, far-reaching
green plain, glittering with the pools and rivulets which are the sources
of the sacred river Jordan. It was a grateful vision, after so much desert.

</p><p>And as the evening drew near, we clambered down the mountain,
through groves of the Biblical oaks of Bashan, (for we were just
stepping over the border and entering the long-sought Holy Land,) and
at its extreme foot, toward the wide valley, we entered this little
execrable village of Banias and camped in a great grove of olive trees
near a torrent of sparkling water whose banks are arrayed in fig-trees,
pomegranates and oleanders in full leaf. Barring the proximity of the
village, it is a sort of paradise.

</p><p>The very first thing one feels like doing when he gets into camp,
all burning up and dusty, is to hunt up a bath. We followed the stream up
to where it gushes out of the mountain side, three hundred yards from the
tents, and took a bath that was so icy that if I did not know this was the
main source of the sacred river, I would expect harm to come of it.  It
was bathing at noonday in the chilly source of the Abana, "River of
Damascus," that gave me the cholera, so Dr. B. said. However, it
generally does give me the cholera to take a bath.

<hr><i>Page 471</i><br>
</p><p>The incorrigible pilgrims have come in with their pockets full of
specimens broken from the ruins. I wish this vandalism could be
stopped. They broke off fragments from Noah's tomb; from the
exquisite sculptures of the temples of Baalbec; from the houses of
Judas and Ananias, in Damascus; from the tomb of Nimrod the Mighty
Hunter in Jonesborough; from the worn Greek and Roman inscriptions
set in the hoary walls of the Castle of Banias; and now they have been
hacking and chipping these old arches here that Jesus looked upon in
the flesh. Heaven protect the Sepulchre when this tribe invades
Jerusalem!

</p><p>The ruins here are not very interesting. There are the massive
walls of a great square building that was once the citadel; there are
many ponderous old arches that are so smothered with debris that they
barely project above the ground; there are heavy-walled sewers through
which the crystal brook of which Jordan is born still runs; in the
hill-side are the substructions of a costly marble temple that Herod the
Great built here--patches of its handsome mosaic floors still remain;
there is a quaint old stone bridge that was here before Herod's time, may
be; scattered every where, in the paths and in the woods, are Corinthian
capitals, broken porphyry pillars, and little fragments of sculpture; and
up yonder in the precipice where the fountain gushes out, are well-worn
Greek inscriptions over niches in the rock where in ancient times the
Greeks, and after them the Romans, worshipped the sylvan god Pan.  But
trees and bushes grow above many of these ruins now; the miserable huts
of a little crew of filthy Arabs are perched upon the broken masonry of
antiquity, the whole place has a sleepy, stupid, rural look about it, and
one can hardly bring himself to believe that a busy, substantially built
city once existed here, even two thousand years ago.  The place was
nevertheless the scene of an event whose effects have added page after
page and volume after volume to the world's history.  For in this place
Christ stood when he said to Peter:

</p><p><font size=-1><blockquote>"Thou art Peter; and upon this rock will
I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And
I will give unto thee the keys of the King-</p></blockquote></font>

<hr><i>Page 472</i><br>

<p><font size=-1><blockquote>dom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven."</blockquote></font>

</p><p>On those little sentences have been built up the mighty edifice of
the Church of Rome; in them lie the authority for the imperial power of
the Popes over temporal affairs, and their godlike power to curse a soul
or wash it white from sin. To sustain the position of "the only true
Church," which Rome claims was thus conferred upon her, she has fought and
labored and struggled for many a century, and will continue to keep
herself busy in the same work to the end of time. The memorable words I
have quoted give to this ruined city about all the interest it possesses
to people of the present day.

</p><p>It seems curious enough to us to be standing on ground that was
once actually pressed by the feet of the Saviour. The situation is
suggestive of a reality and a tangibility that seem at variance with the
vagueness and mystery and ghostliness that one naturally attaches to
the character of a god. I can not comprehend yet that I am sitting
where a god has stood, and looking upon the brook and the mountains
which that god looked upon, and am surrounded by dusky men and
women whose ancestors saw him, and even talked with him, face to
face, and carelessly, just as they would have done with any other
stranger. I can not comprehend this; the gods of my understanding
have been always hidden in clouds and very far away.

</p><p>This morning, during breakfast, the usual assemblage of squalid
humanity sat patiently without the charmed circle of the camp and
waited for such crumbs as pity might bestow upon their misery. There
were old and young, brown-skinned and yellow. Some of the men were
tall and stalwart, (for one hardly sees any where such splendid-looking
men as here in the East,) but all the women and children looked worn
and sad, and distressed with hunger. They reminded me much of
Indians, did these people. They had but little clothing, but such as they
had was fanciful in character and fantastic in its arrangement. Any
little absurd gewgaw or gimcrack they had they disposed in such a way
as to make it attract attention

<hr><i>Page 473</i><br>
most readily. They sat in silence, and with tireless patience watched
our every motion with that vile, uncomplaining impoliteness which is
so truly Indian, and which makes a white man so nervous and
uncomfortable and savage that he wants to exterminate the whole
tribe.

</p><p>These people about us had other peculiarities, which I have noticed
in the noble red man, too: they were infested with vermin, and the dirt
had caked on them till it amounted to bark.

</p><p>The little children were in a pitiable condition--they all had sore
eyes, and were otherwise afflicted in various ways. They say that
hardly a native child in all the East is free from sore eyes, and that
thousands of them go blind of one eye or both every year. I think this
must be so, for I see plenty of blind people every day, and I do not
remember seeing any children that hadn't sore eyes. And, would you
suppose that an American mother could sit for an hour, with her child
in her arms, and let a hundred flies roost upon its eyes all that time
undisturbed? I see that every day. It makes my flesh creep. Yesterday
we met a woman riding on a little jackass, and she had a little child in
her arms--honestly, I thought the child had goggles on as we
approached, and I wondered how its mother could afford so much
style. But when we drew near, we saw that the goggles were nothing
but a camp meeting of flies assembled around each of the child's eyes,
and at the same time there was a detachment prospecting its nose. The
flies were happy, the child was contented, and so the mother did not
interfere.

</p><p>As soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our party,
they began to flock in from all quarters. Dr. B., in the charity of his
nature, had taken a child from a woman who sat near by, and put some
sort of a wash upon its diseased eyes. That woman went off and
started the whole nation, and it was a sight to see them swarm! The
lame, the halt, the blind, the leprous--all the distempers that are bred
of indolence, dirt, and iniquity--were represented in the Congress in
ten minutes, and still they came! Every woman that had a

<hr><i>Page 474</i><br>
sick baby brought it along, and every woman that hadn't, borrowed one.
What reverent and what worshiping looks they bent upon that dread,
mysterious power, the Doctor! They watched him take his phials out; they
watched him measure the particles of white powder; they watched him add
drops of one precious liquid, and drops of another; they lost not the
slightest movement; their eyes were riveted upon him with a fascination
that nothing could distract. I believe they thought he was gifted like a
god. When each individual got his portion of medicine, his eyes were
radiant with joy--notwithstanding by nature they are a thankless and
impassive race--and upon his face was written the unquestioning faith
that nothing on earth could prevent the patient from getting well now.

</p><p>Christ knew how to preach to these simple, superstitious,
disease-tortured creatures: He healed the sick. They flocked to our poor
human doctor this morning when the fame of what he had done to the
sick child went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with their
eyes while they did not know

<hr><i>Page 475</i><br>
as yet whether there was virtue in his simples or not. The ancestors of
these--people precisely like them in color, dress, manners, customs,
simplicity--flocked in vast multitudes after Christ, and when they saw Him
make the afflicted whole with a word, it is no wonder they worshiped Him.
No wonder His deeds were the talk of the nation. No wonder the multitude
that followed Him was so great that at one time--thirty miles from
here--they had to let a sick man down through the roof because no approach
could be made to the door; no wonder His audiences were so great at
Galilee that He had to preach from a ship removed a little distance from
the shore; no wonder that even in the desert places about Bethsaida, five
thousand invaded His solitude, and He had to feed them by a miracle or
else see them suffer for their confiding faith and devotion; no wonder
when there was a great commotion in a city in those days, one neighbor
explained it to another in words to this effect: "They say that Jesus of
Nazareth is come!"

</p><p>Well, as I was saying, the doctor distributed medicine as long as
he had any to distribute, and his reputation is mighty in Galilee this
day.  Among his patients was the child of the Shiek's daughter--for even
this poor, ragged handful of sores and sin has its royal Shiek--a poor old
mummy that looked as if he would be more at home in a poor-house than in
the Chief Magistracy of this tribe of hopeless, shirtless savages.  The
princess--I mean the Shiek's daughter--was only thirteen or fourteen years
old, and had a very sweet face and a pretty one. She was the only Syrian
female we have seen yet who was not so sinfully ugly that she couldn't
smile after ten o'clock Saturday night without breaking the Sabbath. Her
child was a hard specimen, though--there wasn't enough of it to make a
pie, and the poor little thing looked so pleadingly up at all who came
near it (as if it had an idea that now was its chance or never,) that we
were filled with compassion which was genuine and not put on.

</p><p>But this last new horse I have got is trying to break his neck over
the tent-ropes, and I shall have to go out and anchor

<hr><i>Page 476</i><br>

him. Jericho and I have parted company. The new horse is not much to boast
of, I think. One of his hind legs bends the wrong way, and the other one
is as straight and stiff as a tent-pole.  Most of his teeth are gone, and
he is as blind as bat. His nose has been broken at some time or other, and
is arched
like a culvert now. His under lip hangs down like a camel's, and his ears
are
chopped off close to his head. I had some trouble at first to find a name
for him, but I finally concluded to call him Baalbec, because he is such a
magnificent ruin. I can not keep from talking about my horses, because I
have a very long and tedious journey before me, and they naturally occupy
my thoughts about as much as matters of apparently much greater
importance.

</p><p>We satisfied our pilgrims by making those hard rides from Baalbec
to Damascus, but Dan's horse and Jack's were so crippled we had to leave
them behind and get fresh animals for them. The dragoman says Jack's horse
died. I swapped horses with Mohammed, the kingly-looking Egyptian who is
our Ferguson's lieutenant. By Ferguson I mean our dragoman Abraham, of
course. I did not take this horse on account of his personal appearance,
but because I have not seen his back. I do not wish to see it. I have seen
the backs of all the other horses, and found most of them covered with
dreadful saddle-boils which I know have not been washed or doctored for
years. The idea of riding all day long over such ghastly in-

<hr><i>Page 477</i><br>
quisitions of torture is sickening. My horse must be like the others, but
I have at least the consolation of not knowing  it to be so.

</p><p>I hope that in future I may be spared any more sentimental praises
of the Arab's idolatry of his horse. In boyhood I longed to be an Arab of
the desert and have a beautiful mare, and call her Selim or Benjamin or
Mohammed, and feed her with my own hands, and let her come into the tent,
and teach her to caress me and look fondly upon me with her great tender
eyes; and I wished that a stranger might come at such a time and offer me
a hundred thousand dollars for her, so that I could do like the other
Arabs--hesitate, yearn for the money, but overcome by my love for my mare,
at last say, "Part with thee, my beautiful one! Never with my life! Away,
tempter, I scorn thy gold!" and then bound into the saddle and speed over
the desert like the wind!

</p><p>But I recall those aspirations. If these Arabs be like the other
Arabs, their love for their beautiful mares is a fraud. These of my
acquaintance have no love for their horses, no sentiment of pity for them,
and no knowledge of how to treat them or care for them. The Syrian
saddle-blanket is a quilted mattress two or three inches thick. It is
never removed from the horse, day or night. It gets full of dirt and hair,
and becomes soaked with sweat. It is bound to breed sores. These pirates
never think of washing a horse's back. They do not shelter the horses in
the tents, either--they must stay out and take the weather as it comes.
Look at poor cropped and dilapidated "Baalbec," and weep for the
sentiment that has been wasted upon the Selims of romance!
