<hr><i>page 90</i><br>
We passed the Fourth of July on board the <i>Quaker City,
</i>in midocean.  It was in all respects a characteristic Mediterranean
day--faultlessly beautiful.  A cloudless sky; a refreshing summer wind; a
radiant sunshine that glinted cheerily from dancing wavelets instead of crested
mountains of water; a sea beneath us that was so wonderfully blue, so richly,
brilliantly blue, that it overcame the dullest sensibilities with the spell of
its fascination.<p>
They even have fine sunsets on the Mediterranean--a thing that is certainly
rare in most quarters of the globe.  The evening we sailed away from Gibraltar,
that hard-featured rock was swimming in a creamy mist so rich, so soft, so
enchantingly vague and dreamy, that even the Oracle, that serene, that
inspired, that overpowering humbug, scorned the dinner gong and tarried to
worship!<p>
He said: "Well, that's gorgis, ain't it!  They don't have none of them things
in our parts, <i>do</i> they?  I consider that them effects is on account of
the superior refragability, as you may say, of the sun's diramic combination
with the lymphatic forces of the perihelion of Jubiter.  What should you
think?"<p>
"Oh,<i> go </i>to bed!" Dan said that and went away.<p>
"Oh, yes, it's all very well to say go to bed when a man makes an argument
which another man can't answer.  Dan don't never stand any chance in an
argument with me.  And he knows it, too.  What should you say, Jack?"<p>
"Now, Doctor, don't you come bothering around me with that dictionary bosh.  I
don't do you any harm, do I? Then you let <i>me </i>alone."<p>
<hr><i>page 91</i><br>
"He's gone, too.  Well, them fellows have all tackled the old Oracle, as they
say, but the old man's most too many for 'em.  Maybe the Poet Lariat ain't
satisfied with them deductions?"<p>
The poet replied with a barbarous rhyme and went below.<p>
"'Pears that <i>he</i> can't qualify, neither.  Well, I didn't expect nothing
out of <i>him.  </i>I never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything.
He'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slush about
that old rock and give it to a consul, or a pilot, or a nigger, or anybody he
comes across first which he can impose on.  Pity but somebody'd take that poor
old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out of him.  Why can't a man put
his intellect onto things that's some value?  Gibbons, and Hippocratus, and
Sarcophagus, and all them old ancient philosophers was down on poets--"<p>
"Doctor," I said, "you are going to invent authorities now and I'll leave you,
too.  I always enjoy your conversation, notwithstanding the luxuriance of your
syllables, when the philosophy you offer rests on your own responsibility; but
when you begin to soar--when you begin to support it with the evidence of
authorities who are the creations of your own fancy--I lose confidence."<p>
That was the way to flatter the doctor.  He considered it a sort of
acknowledgment on my part of a fear to argue with him.  He was always
persecuting the passengers with abstruse propositions framed in language that
no man could understand, and they endured the exquisite torture a minute or two
and then abandoned the field.  A triumph like this over half a
<hr><i>page 92</i><br>
 dozen
antagonists was sufficient for one day; from that time forward he would patrol
the decks beaming blandly upon all comers, and so tranquilly, blissfully
happy!<p>
But I digress.  The thunder of our two brave cannon announced the Fourth of
July, at daylight, to all who were awake.  But many of us got our information
at a later hour, from the almanac.  All the flags were sent aloft except half a
dozen that were needed to decorate portions of the ship below, and in a short
time the vessel assumed a holiday appearance.  During the morning, meetings
were held and all manner of committees set to work on the celebration
ceremonies. in the afternoon the ship's company assembled aft, on deck, under
the awnings; the flute, the asthmatic melodeon, and the consumptive clarinet
crippled "The Star-Spangled Banner," the choir chased it to cover, and George
came in with a peculiarly lacerating screech on the final note and slaughtered
it. Nobody mourned.<p>
We carried out the corpse on three cheers (that joke was not intentional and I
do not endorse it), and then the President, throned behind a cable locker with
a national flag spread over it, announced the "Reader," who rose up and read
that same old Declaration of Independence which we have all listened to so
often without paying any attention to what it said; and after that the
President piped the Orator of the Day to quarters and he made that same old
speech about our national greatness which we so religiously believe and so
fervently applaud.  Now came the choir into court again, with the complaining
instruments, and assaulted "Hail Columbia"; and when victory hung wavering in
the scale, George returned with his dreadful wild-goose stop turned on and the
choir won, of course.  A minister pronounced the benediction, and the patriotic
little gathering disbanded.  The Fourth of July was safe, as far as the
Mediterranean was concerned.<p>
At dinner in the evening, a well-written original poem was recited with spirit
by one of the ship's captains, and thirteen regular toasts were washed down
with several baskets of champagne.  The speeches were bad--execrable almost
without
<hr><i>page 93</i><br>
 exception.  In fact, without <i>any</i> exception but one.  Captain
Duncan made a good speech; he made the only good speech of the evening.  He
said:<p>
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: May we all live to a green old age and be prosperous and
happy.  Steward, bring up another basket of champagne."<p>
It was regarded as a very able effort.<p>
The festivities, so to speak, closed with another of those miraculous balls on
the promenade deck.  We were not used to dancing on an even keel, though, and
it was only a questionable success.  But take it all together, it was a bright,
cheerful, pleasant Fourth.<p>
Toward nightfall the next evening, we steamed into the great artificial harbor
of this noble city of Marseilles, and saw the dying sunlight gild its
clustering spires and ramparts, and flood its leagues of environing verdure
with a mellow radiance that touched with an added charm the white villas that
flecked the landscape far and near. [Copyright secured according to law.]<p>
There were no stages out, and we could not get on the pier from the ship.  It
was annoying.  We were full of enthusiasm--we wanted to see France! Just at
nightfall our party of three contracted with a waterman for the privilege of
using his boat as a bridge--its stern was at our companion ladder and its bow
touched the pier.  We got in and the fellow backed out into the harbor.  I told
him in French that all we wanted was to walk over his thwarts and step ashore,
and asked him what he went away out there for.  He said he could not understand
me.  I repeated.  Still he could not understand.  He appeared to be very
ignorant of French.  The doctor tried him, but he could not understand the
doctor.  I asked this boatman to explain his conduct, which he did; and then I
couldn't understand <i>him</i>.  Dan said:<p>
"Oh, go to the pier, you old fool--that's where we want to go!"<p>
We reasoned calmly with Dan that it was useless to speak to this foreigner in
English--that he had better let us conduct this business in the French language
and not let the stranger see how uncultivated he was.<p>
<hr><i>page 94</i><br>
"Well, go on, go on," he said, "don't mind me.  I don't wish to interfere.
Only, if you go on telling him in your kind of French, he never will find out
where we want to go to.  That is what I think about it."<p>
We rebuked him severely for this remark and said we never knew an ignorant
person yet but was prejudiced.  The Frenchman spoke again, and the doctor
said:<p>
"There now, Dan, he says he is going to allez to the douain.
Means he is going to the hotel.  Oh, certainly--<i>we</i> don't know the
French language."<p>
This was a crusher, as Jack would say.  It silenced further criticism from the
disaffected member.  We coasted past the sharp bows of a navy of great
steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stone pier.  It
was easy to remember then that the <i>douain </i>was the customhouse and not
the hotel.  We did not mention it, however.  With winning French politeness the
officers merely opened and closed our satchels, declined to examine our
passports, and sent us on our way.  We stopped at the first caf&eacute; we came
to and entered.  An old woman seated us at a table and waited for orders.  The
doctor said:<p>
"Avez-vous du vin?"<p>
The dame looked perplexed.  The doctor said again, with elaborate distinctness
of articulation:<p>
"Avez-vous du--vin!"<p>
The dame looked more perplexed than before.  I said:<p>
"Doctor, there is a flaw in your pronunciation somewhere.  Let me try her.
Madame, avez-vous du vin?  It isn't any use, Doctor--take the
witness."<p>
"Madame, avez-vous du vin--du fromage--pain--pickled pigs'
feet--beurre--des &oelig;ufs--du boeuf--horseradish, sauerkraut, hog
and hominy--anything, anything in the world that can stay a Christian
stomach!"<p>
She said:<p>
"Bless you, why didn't you speak English before?  I don't know anything about
your plagued French!"<p>
The humiliating taunts of the disaffected member spoiled
<hr><i>page 95</i><br>
the supper, and we
dispatched it in angry silence and got away as soon as we could.  Here we were
in beautiful France--in a vast stone house of quaint architecture--surrounded
by all manner of curiously worded French signs--stared at by strangely habited,
bearded French people--everything gradually and surely forcing upon us the
coveted consciousness that at last, and beyond all question, we <i>were </i>in
beautiful France and absorbing its nature to the forgetfulness of everything
else, and coming to feel the happy romance of the thing in all its enchanting
delightfulness--and to think of this skinny veteran intruding with her vile
English, at such a moment, to blow the fair vision to the winds! It was
exasperating.<p>
We set out to find the center of the city, inquiring the direction every now.
and then.  We never did succeed in making anybody understand just exactly what
we wanted, and neither did we ever succeed in comprehending just exactly what
they<hr><i>page 96</i><br>
said in reply, but then they always pointed--they always did that--and we
bowed politely and said, "Merci, monsieur," and so it was a blighting
triumph over the disaffected member anyway.  He was restive under these
victories and often asked:<p>
"What did that pirate say?"<p>
"Why, he told us which way to go to find the Grand Casino."<p>
"Yes, but what did he <i>say</i>?"<p>
"Oh, it don't matter what he said--<i>we</i> understood him.  These are educated
people not like that absurd boatman."<p>
"Well, I wish they were educated enough to tell a man a direction that goes
<i>some</i>where--for we've been going around in a circle for an hour.  I've
passed this same old drugstore seven times."<p>
We said it was a low, disreputable falsehood (but we knew it was not).  It was
plain that it would not do to pass that drugstore again, though--we might go on
asking directions, but we must cease from following finger-pointings if we
hoped to check the suspicions of the disaffected member.<p>
A long walk through smooth, asphaltum-paved streets bordered by blocks of vast
new mercantile houses of cream-colored stone every house and every block
precisely like all the other houses and all the other blocks for a mile, and
all brilliantly lighted--brought us at last to the principal thoroughfare.  On
every hand were bright colors, flashing constellations of gas burners, gaily
dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks--hurry, life, activity,
cheerfulness, conversation, and laughter everywhere! We found the Grand Hotel
du Louvre et de la Paix, and wrote down who we were, where we were born, what
our occupations were, the place we came from last, whether we were married or
single, how we liked it, how old we were, where we were bound for and when we
expected to
<hr><i>page 97</i><br>
get there, and a great deal of information of similar
importance--all for the benefit of the landlord and the secret police.  We
hired a guide and began the business of sightseeing immediately.  That first
night on French soil was a stirring one.  I cannot think of half the places we
went to or what we particularly saw; we had no disposition to examine carefully
into anything at all--we only wanted to glance and go--to move, keep moving!
The spirit of the country was upon us.  We sat down, finally, at a late hour,
in the great Casino, and called for unstinted champagne.  It is so easy to be
bloated aristocrats where it costs nothing of consequence! There were about
five hundred people in that dazzling place, I suppose, though the walls being
papered entirely with mirrors, so to speak, one could not really tell but that
there were a hundred thousand.  Young, daintily dressed exquisites and young,
stylishly dressed women, and also old gentlemen and old ladies, sat in couples
and groups about innumerable marble-topped tables and ate fancy suppers, drank
wine, and kept up a chattering din of conversation that was dazing to the
senses.  There was a stage at the far end and a large orchestra; and every now
and then actors and actresses in preposterous comic dresses came out and sang
the most extravagantly funny songs, to judge by their absurd actions; but that
audience merely suspended its chatter, stared cynically, and never once smiled,
never once applauded!  I had always thought that Frenchmen were ready to laugh
at anything.
