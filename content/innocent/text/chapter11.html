<hr><i>page 98</i><br>
We are getting foreignized rapidly and with facility.  We
are getting reconciled to halls and bedchambers with unhomelike stone floors
and no carpets--floors that ring to the tread of one's heels with a sharpness
that is death to sentimental musing.  We are getting used to tidy, noiseless
waiters, who glide hither and thither, and hover about your back and your
elbows like butterflies, quick to comprehend orders, quick to fill them;
thankful for a gratuity without regard to the amount; and always polite--never
otherwise than polite.  That is the strangest curiosity yet--a really polite
hotel waiter who isn't an idiot.  We are getting used to driving right into the
central court of the hotel, in the midst of a fragrant circle of vines and
flowers, and in the midst also of parties of gentlemen sitting quietly reading
the paper and smoking.  We are getting used to ice frozen by artificial process
in ordinary bottles--the only kind of ice they have here.  We are getting used
to all these things, but we are, <i>not </i>getting used to carrying our own
soap.  We are sufficiently civilized to carry our own combs and toothbrushes,
but this thing of having to ring for soap every time we wash is new to us and
not pleasant at all.  We think of it just after we get our heads and faces
thoroughly wet or just when we think we have been in the bathtub long enough,
and then, of course, an annoying delay follows.  These Marseillaises make
Marseillaise hymns and Marseilles vests and Marseilles soap for all the world,
but they never sing their hymns or wear their vests or wash with their soap
themselves.<p>

We have learned to go through the lingering routine of the table d'h&ocirc;te
with patience, with serenity, with satisfaction.  We take soup, then wait a few
minutes for the fish; a few minutes more and the plates are changed, and the
roast beef comes; another change and we take peas; change again and take
lentils; change and take snail patties (I prefer grasshoppers); change and take
roast chicken and salad; then strawberry pie and ice cream; then green figs,
pears, oranges, green almonds, etc.; finally coffee.  Wine with every course,
of course, being in France.  With such a cargo on board, digestion is a slow
process, and we must sit long in the cool chambers and smoke--and read French
newspapers, which have a strange fashion of telling a perfectly straight story
till you get to the "nub" of it, and then a word drops in that no man can
translate, and that story is ruined.  An embankment fell on some Frenchmen
yesterday, and the papers are full of it today--but whether those sufferers
were killed, or crippled, or bruised, or only scared is more than I can
possibly make out, and yet I would just give anything to know.<p>
We were troubled a little at dinner today by the conduct of an American, who
talked very loudly and coarsely and laughed boisterously where all others were
so quiet and well behaved.  He ordered wine with a royal flourish and said:
<hr><i>page 100</i><br> "I
never dine without wine, sir" (which was a pitiful falsehood), and looked
around upon the company to bask in the admiration he expected to find in their
faces.  All these airs in a land where they would as soon expect to leave the
soup out of the bill of fare as the wine!--in a land where wine is nearly as
common among all ranks as water! This fellow said: "I am a freeborn sovereign,
sir, an American, sir, and I want everybody to know it!" He did not mention
that he was a lineal descendant of Balaam's ass, but everybody knew that
without his telling it.<p>
We have driven in the Prado--that superb avenue bordered with patrician
mansions and noble shade trees--and have visited the ch&acirc;teau Boarely and
its curious museum.  They showed us a miniature cemetery there--a copy of the
first graveyard that was ever in Marseilles, no doubt.  The delicate little
skeletons were lying in broken vaults and had their household gods and kitchen
utensils with them.  The original of this cemetery was dug up in the principal
street of the city a few years ago.  It had remained there, only twelve feet
underground, for a matter of twenty-five hundred years or thereabouts.  Romulus
was here before he built Rome, and thought something of founding a city on this
spot, but gave up the idea.  He may have been personally acquainted with some
of these Phoenicians whose skeletons we have been examining.<p>
In the great Zoological Gardens we found specimens of all the animals the world
produces, I think, including a dromedary, a monkey ornamented with tufts of
brilliant blue and 
<hr><i>page 101</i><br>
carmine hair--a very gorgeous monkey he was--a hippopotamus
from the Nile, and a sort of tall, long-legged bird with a beak like a powder
horn and close-fitting wings like the tails of a dress coat.  This fellow stood
up with his eyes shut and his shoulders stooped forward a little, and looked as
if he had his hands under his coattails.  Such tranquil stupidity, such
supernatural gravity, such self-righteousness, and such ineffable
self-complacency as were in the countenance and attitude of that gray-bodied,
dark-winged, bald-headed, and preposterously uncomely bird!  He was so
ungainly, so pimply about the head, so scaly about the legs, yet so serene, so
unspeakably satisfied! He was the most comical-looking creature that can be
imagined.  It was good to hear Dan and the doctor laugh--such natural and such
enjoyable laughter had not been heard among our excursionists since our ship
sailed away from America.  This bird was a godsend to us, and I should be an
ingrate if I forgot to make honorable mention of him in these pages.  Ours was
a pleasure excursion; therefore we stayed with that bird an hour and made the
most of him.  We stirred him up occasionally, but he only unclosed an eye and
slowly closed it again, abating no jot of his stately piety of demeanor or his
tremendous seriousness.  He only seemed to say, "Defile not Heaven's anointed
with unsanctified hands." We did not know his name, and so we called him "The
Pilgrim." Dan said:<p>

"All he wants now is a Plymouth Collection."<p>
The boon companion of the colossal elephant was a common cat! This cat had a
fashion of climbing up the elephant's hind legs and roosting on his back.  She
would sit up there, with her paws curved under her breast, and sleep in the sun
half the afternoon.  It used to annoy the elephant at first, and he would reach
up and take her down, but she would go aft and climb up again.  She persisted
until she finally conquered the elephant's prejudices, and now they are
inseparable friends.  The cat plays about her comrade's forefeet or his trunk
often, until dogs approach, and then she goes aloft out of danger.  The
elephant has annihilated several dogs lately that pressed his companion too
closely.<p>
We hired a sailboat and a guide and made an excursion to one of the small
islands in the harbor to visit the Castle d'If.  This ancient fortress has a
melancholy history.  It has been used as a prison for political offenders for
two or three hundred years, and its dungeon walls are scarred with the rudely
carved names of many and many a captive who fretted his life away here and left
no record of himself but these sad epitaphs wrought with his own hands.  How
thick the names were! And their long-departed owners seemed to throng the
gloomy cells and corridors with their phantom shapes.  We loitered through
dungeon after dungeon, away down into the living rock below the level of the
sea, it seemed.  Names everywhere!--some plebeian, some noble, some even
princely.  Plebeian, prince, and noble had one solicitude in common--they would
not be forgotten! They could suffer solitude, inactivity, and the horrors of a
silence that no sound ever disturbed, but they could not bear the thought of
being utterly forgotten by the world.  Hence the carved names.  In one cell,
where a little light penetrated, a man had lived twenty-seven years without
seeing the face of a human being--lived in filth and wretchedness, with no
companionship but his own thoughts, and they were sorrowful enough and hopeless
enough, no doubt.  Whatever his jailers considered that he needed was conveyed
to his cell by night through a wicket.  
<hr><i>page 103</i><br>
This man carved the walls of his prison
house from floor to roof with all manner of figures of men and animals grouped
in intricate designs.  He had toiled there year after year, at his
self-appointed task, while infants grew to boyhood--to vigorous youth--idled
through school and college--acquired a profession--claimed man's mature
estate--married and looked back to infancy as to a thing <hr><i>page
104</i><br>of some vague, ancient
time, almost.  But who shall tell how many ages it seemed to this prisoner?
With the one, time flew sometimes; with the other, never--it crawled always.
To the one, nights spent in dancing had seemed made of minutes instead of
hours; to the other, those selfsame nights had been like all other nights of
dungeon life and seemed made of slow, dragging weeks instead of hours and
minutes.<p>
One prisoner of fifteen years had scratched verses upon his walls, and brief
prose sentences--brief, but full of pathos.  These spoke not of himself and his
hard estate, but only of the shrine where his spirit fled the prison to
worship--of home and the idols that were templed there.  He never lived to see
them.<p>
The walls of these dungeons are as thick as some bedchambers at home are
wide--fifteen feet.  We saw the damp, dismal cells in which two of Dumas'
heroes passed their confinement--heroes of "Monte Cristo."  It was here
that the brave Abb&eacute; wrote a book with his own blood, with a pen made of
a piece of iron hoop, and by the light of a lamp made out of shreds of cloth
soaked in grease obtained from his food; and then dug through the thick wall
with some trifling instrument which he wrought himself out of a stray piece of
iron or table cutlery and freed Dant&eacute;s from his chains.  It was a pity
that so many weeks of dreary labor should have come to naught at last.<p>
They showed us the noisome cell where the celebrated "Iron Mask"--that
ill-starred brother of a hardhearted king of France--was confined for a season
before he was sent to hide the strange mystery of his life from the curious in
the dungeons of Ste. Marguerite. The place had a far greater interest for us
than it could have had if we had known beyond all question who the Iron Mask
was, and what his history had been, and why this most unusual punishment had
been meted out to him.  Mystery! That was the charm.  That speechless tongue,
those prisoned features, that heart so freighted with unspoken troubles, and
that breast so oppressed with its piteous secret had been here.  These dank
walls had known the man whose dolorous story is a sealed book forever! There
was fascination in the spot.
