I think the Azores must be very little known in America.
Out of our whole ship's company there was not a solitary individual who knew
anything whatever about them.  Some of the party, well read concerning most
other lands, had no other information about the Azores than that they were a
group of nine or ten small islands far out in the Atlantic, something more than
halfway between New York and Gibraltar.  That was all.  These considerations
move me to put in a paragraph of dry facts just here.<p>
The community is eminently Portuguese--that is to say, it is slow, poor,
shiftless, sleepy, and lazy.  There is a civil governor, appointed by the King
of Portugal, and also a military governor, who can assume supreme control and
suspend the civil government at his pleasure.  The islands contain a population
of about 200,000, almost entirely Portuguese.  Everything is staid and settled,
for the country was one hundred years old when Columbus discovered America.
The principal crop is corn, and they raise it and grind it just as their
great-great-great-grandfathers did.  They plow with a board slightly shod with
iron; their trifling little harrows are drawn by men and women; small windmills
grind the corn, ten bushels a day, and there is one assistant superintendent to
feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going
to sleep.  When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and actually turn
the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are in proper position,
instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could be moved instead of the
<hr><i>page 56</i><br>
mill.  Oxen tread the wheat from the ear, after the fashion prevalent in the
time of Methuselah.  There is not a wheelbarrow in the land--they carry
everything on their heads, or on donkeys, or in a wicker-bodied cart, whose
wheels are solid blocks of wood and whose axles turn with the wheel.  There is
not a modern plow in the islands or a threshing machine.  All attempts to
introduce them have failed.  The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and
prayed God to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his
father did before him.  The climate is mild; they never have snow or ice, and I
saw no chimneys in the town.  The donkeys and the men, women, and children of a
family all eat and sleep in the same room, and are unclean, are ravaged by
vermin, and are truly happy.  The people lie, and cheat the stranger, and are
desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their dead.  The latter
trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys they eat and sleep
with.  The only well-dressed Portuguese in the camp are the half a dozen
well-to-do families, the Jesuit priests, and the soldiers of the little
garrison.  The wages of a laborer are twenty to twenty-four cents a day, and
those of a good mechanic about twice as much.  They count it in reis at a
thousand to the dollar, and this makes them rich and contented.  Fine grapes
used to grow in the islands, and an excellent wine was made and exported.  But
a disease killed all the vines fifteen years ago, and since that time no wine
has been made.  The islands being wholly of volcanic origin, the soil is
necessarily very rich.  Nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation, and
two or three crops a year of each article are produced, but nothing is exported
save a few oranges--chiefly to England.  Nobody comes here, and nobody goes
away.  News is a thing unknown in Fayal.  A thirst for it is a passion equally
unknown.  A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our civil war was
over.  Because, he said, somebody had told him it was--or at least it ran in
his mind that somebody had told him something like that! And when a passenger
gave an officer of the garrison copies of the <i>Tribune, </i>the<i> Herald,
</i>and<i> Times</i>, he was
<hr><i>page 57</i><br>
 surprised to find later news in them from Lisbon
than he had just received by the little monthly steamer.  He was told that it
came by cable.  He said he knew they had tried to lay a cable ten years ago,
but it had been in his mind somehow that they hadn't succeeded!<p>
It is in communities like this that Jesuit humbuggery flourishes.  We visited a
Jesuit cathedral nearly two hundred years old and found in it a piece of the
veritable cross upon which our Saviour was crucified.  It was polished and
hard, and in as excellent a state of preservation as if the dread tragedy on
Calvary had occurred yesterday instead of eighteen centuries ago.  But these
confiding people believe in that piece of wood unhesitatingly.<p>
In a chapel of the cathedral is an altar with facings of solid silver--at least
they call it so, and I think myself it would go a couple of hundred to the ton
(to speak after the fashion of the silver miners)--and before it is kept
forever burning a small lamp.  A devout lady who died, left money and
contracted for unlimited masses for the repose of her soul, and also stipulated
that this lamp should be kept lighted always, day and night.  She did all this
before she died, you understand.  It is a very small lamp and a very dim one,
and it could not work her much damage, I think, if it went out altogether.<p>
The great altar of the cathedral and also three or four minor ones are a
perfect mass of gilt gimcracks and gingerbread.  And they have a swarm of
rusty, dusty, battered apostles standing around the filagree work, some on one
leg and some with one eye out but a gamey look in the other, and some with two
or three fingers gone, and some with not enough nose left to blow--all of them
crippled and discouraged, and fitter subjects for the hospital than the
cathedral.<p>
The walls of the chancel are of porcelain, all pictured over with figures of
almost life size, very elegantly wrought and dressed in the fanciful costumes
of two centuries ago.  The design was a history of something or somebody, but
none of us were learned enough to read the story.  The old father,
<hr><i>page 58</i><br>reposing
under a stone close by, dated 1686, might have told us if he could have risen.
But he didn't.<p>
As we came down through the town we encountered a squad of little donkeys ready
saddled for use.  The saddles were peculiar, to say the least.  They consisted
of a sort of saw-buck with a small mattress on it, and this furniture covered
about half the donkey.  There were no stirrups, but really such supports were
not needed--to use such a saddle was the next thing to riding a dinner
table--there was ample support clear out to one's knee joints.  A pack of
ragged Portuguese muleteers crowded around us, offering their beasts at half a
dollar an hour--more rascality to the stranger, for the market price is sixteen
cents.  Half a dozen of us mounted the ungainly affairs and submitted to the
indignity of making a ridiculous spectacle of ourselves through the principal
streets of a town of 10,000 inhabitants.<p>
We started.  It was not a trot, a gallop, or a canter, but a stampede, and made
up of all possible or conceivable gaits.  No spurs were necessary.  There was a
muleteer to every donkey and a dozen volunteers beside, and they banged the
donkeys with their goad sticks, and pricked them with their spikes, and shouted
something that sounded like <i>"Sekki-yah!" </i>and kept up a din and a racket
that was worse than Bedlam itself.  These rascals were all on foot, but no
matter, they were always up to time--they can outrun and outlast a donkey.
Altogether, ours was a lively and a picturesque procession, and drew crowded
audiences to the balconies wherever we went.<p>
Blucher could do nothing at all with his donkey.  The beast scampered zigzag
across the road and the others ran into him; he scraped Blucher against carts
and the corners of houses; the road was fenced in with high stone walls, and
the donkey gave him a polishing first on one side and then on the other, but
never once took the middle; he finally came to the house he was born in and
darted into the parlor, scraping Blucher off at the doorway.  After remounting,
Blucher said to the muleteer, "Now, that's enough, you know; you go slow
hereafter."
<hr><i>page 59</i><br>
But the fellow knew no English and did not understand, so he simply
said, <i>"Sekki-yah!" </i>and the donkey was off again like a shot.  He turned
a comer suddenly, and Blucher went over his head.  And, to speak truly, every
mule stumbled over the two, and the whole cavalcade was piled up in a heap.  No
harm done.  A fall from one of those donkeys is of little more consequence than
rolling off a sofa.  The donkeys all stood still after the catastrophe and
waited for their dismembered saddles to be patched up and put on by the noisy
muleteers.  Blucher was pretty angry and wanted to swear, but every time he
opened his mouth his animal did so
<hr><i>page 60</i><br>
also and let off a series of brays that
drowned all other sounds.<p>
It was fun, scurrying around the breezy hills and through the beautiful
canyons.  There was that rare thing, novelty, about it; it was a fresh, new,
exhilarating sensation, this donkey riding, and worth a hundred worn and
threadbare home pleasures.<p>
The roads were a wonder, and well they might be.  Here was an island with only
a handful of people in it--25,000--and yet such fine roads do not exist in the
United States outside of Central Park.  Everywhere you go, in any direction,
you find either a hard, smooth, level thoroughfare, just sprinkled with black
lava sand, and bordered with little gutters neatly paved with small smooth
pebbles, or compactly paved ones like Broadway.  They talk much of the Russ
pavement in New York, and call it a new invention--yet here they have been
using it in this remote little isle of the sea for two hundred years! Every
street in Horta is handsomely paved with the heavy Russ blocks, and the surface
is neat and true as a floor--not marred by holes like Broadway.  And every road
is fenced in by tall, solid lava walls, which will last a thousand years in
this land where frost is unknown.  They are very thick, and are often plastered
and whitewashed and capped with projecting slabs of cut stone.  Trees from
gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down, and contrast their bright green
with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls and make them beautiful.  The
trees and vines stretch across these narrow roadways sometimes and so shut out
the sun that you seem to be riding through a tunnel.  The pavements, the roads,
and the bridges are all government work.<p>
The bridges are of a single span--a single arch--of cut stone, without a
support, and paved on top with flags of lava and ornamental pebblework.
Everywhere are walls, walls, walls, and all of them tasteful and handsome--and
eternally substantial; and everywhere are those marvelous pavements, so neat,
so smooth, and so indestructible.  And if ever roads and streets and the
outsides of houses were perfectly
<hr><i>page 61</i><br>
free from any sign or semblance of dirt, or
dust, or mud, or uncleanliness of any kind, it is Horta, it is Fayal.  The
lower classes of the people, in their persons and their domiciles, are not
clean--but there it stops--the town and the island are miracles of
cleanliness.<p>
We arrived home again finally, after a ten-mile excursion, and the
irrepressible muleteers scampered at our heels through the main street, goading
the donkeys, shouting the everlasting <i>"Sekki-yah," </i>and singing "John
Brown's Body" in ruinous English.<p>
When we were dismounted and it came to settling, the shouting and jawing and
swearing and quarreling among the muleteers and with us was nearly deafening.
One fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of his donkey; another
claimed half a dollar for pricking him up, another a quarter for helping in
that service, and about fourteen guides presented bills for showing us the way
through the town and its environs; and every vagrant of them was more
vociferous, and more vehement and more frantic in gesture than his neighbor.
We paid one guide and paid for one muleteer to each donkey.<p>
The mountains on some of the islands are very high.  We sailed along the shore
of the island of Pico, under a stately green pyramid that rose up with one
unbroken sweep from our very feet to. an altitude of 7,613 feet, and thrust its
summit above the white clouds like an island adrift in a fog!<p>
We got plenty of fresh oranges, lemons, figs, apricots, etc., in these Azores,
of course.  But I will desist.  I am not here to write Patent Office reports.<p>
We are on our way to Gibraltar, and shall reach there five or six days out from
the Azores.
