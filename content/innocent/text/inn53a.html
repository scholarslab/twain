<i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER LIII.
</h3></center>

<p>A FAST walker could go outside the walls of Jerusalem and walk entirely around the city
in an hour. I do not know how else to make one understand how small it is. The appearance of
the city is peculiar. It is as knobby with countless little domes as a prison door is with
bolt-heads. Every house has from one to half a dozen of these white plastered domes of stone,
broad and low, sitting in the centre of, or in a cluster upon, the flat roof. Wherefore, when one
looks down from an eminence, upon the compact mass of houses (so closely crowded together,
in fact, that there is no appearance of streets at all, and so the city looks solid,) he sees the
knobbiest town in the world, except Constantinople. It looks as if it might be roofed, from
centre to circumference, with inverted saucers. The monotony of the view is interrupted only
by the great Mosque of Omar, the Tower of Hippicus, and one or two other buildings that rise
into commanding prominence.

</p><p>The houses are generally two stories high, built strongly of masonry, whitewashed
or plastered outside, and have a cage of wooden lattice-work projecting in front of every
window. To reproduce a Jerusalem street, it would only be necessary to up-end a chicken-coop
and hang it before each window in an alley of American houses.

</p><p>The streets are roughly and badly paved with stone, and are tolerably
crooked -- enough so to make each street appear to close together constantly and come to an end
about a hundred yards ahead of a pilgrim as long as he chooses to walk in it. Projecting from
the top of the lower story of many of the
</p><hr /><i>Page 559</i><br /><p>
houses is a very narrow porch-roof or shed, without
supports from below; and I have several times seen cats jump across the street from one shed
to the other when they were out calling. The cats could have jumped double the distance without
extraordinary exertion. I mention these things to give an idea of how narrow the streets are.
Since a cat can jump across them without the least inconvenience, it is hardly necessary to state
that such streets are too narrow for carriages. These vehicles cannot navigate the Holy City.

</p><p>The population of Jerusalem is composed of Moslems, Jews, Greeks, Latins, Armenians,
Syrians, Copts, Abyssinians, Greek Catholics, and a handful of Protestants. One hundred of the
latter sect are all that dwell now in this birthplace of Christianity. The nice shades of nationality
comprised in the above list, and the languages spoken by them, are altogether too numerous to
mention. It seems to me that all the races and colors and tongues of the earth must be
represented among the fourteen thousand souls that dwell in Jerusalem. Rags, wretchedness,
poverty and dirt, those signs and symbols that indicate the presence of Moslem rule more surely
than the crescent-flag itself, abound. Lepers, cripples, the blind, and the idiotic, assail you on
every hand, and they know but one word of but one language apparently -- the eternal
"bucksheesh." To see the numbers of maimed, malformed and diseased humanity that
</p><hr /><i>Page 560</i><br /><p>
throng the
holy places and obstruct the gates, one might suppose that the ancient days had come again, and
that the angel of the Lord was expected to descend at any moment to stir the waters of Bethesda.
Jerusalem is mournful, and dreary, and lifeless. I would not desire to live here.

</p><p>One naturally goes first to the Holy Sepulchre. It is right in the city, near the western gate; it
and the place of the Crucifixion, and, in fact, every other place intimately connected with that
tremendous event, are ingeniously massed together and covered by one roof -- the dome of the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

</p><p>
Entering the building, through the midst of the usual assemblage of beggars, one sees on his
left a few Turkish guards -- for Christians of different sects will not only quarrel, but fight, also,
in this sacred place, if allowed to do it. Before you is a marble slab, which covers the Stone of
Unction, whereon the Saviour's body was laid to prepare it for burial. It was found necessary
to conceal the real stone in this way in order to save it from destruction. Pilgrims were too much
given to chipping off pieces of it to carry home. Near by is a circular railing which marks the
spot where the Virgin stood when the Lord's body was anointed.

</p><p>
Entering the great Rotunda, we stand before the most sacred locality in Christendom -- the
grave of Jesus. It is in the centre of the church, and immediately under the great dome. It is
inclosed in a sort of little temple of yellow and white stone, of fanciful design. Within the little
temple is a portion of the very stone which was rolled away from the door of the Sepulchre, and
on which the angel was sitting when Mary came thither "at early dawn." Stooping low, we enter
the vault -- the Sepulchre itself. It is only about six feet by seven, and the stone couch on which
the dead Saviour lay extends from end to end of the apartment and occupies half its width. It
is covered with a marble slab which has been much worn by the lips of pilgrims. This slab
serves as an altar, now. Over it hang some fifty gold and silver lamps, which are kept always
burning, and the place is otherwise scandalized by trumpery, gewgaws, and tawdry
ornamentation.
</p><hr /><i>Page 561</i><br />
<p>
All sects of Christians (except Protestants,) have chapels under the roof of the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, and each must keep to itself and not venture upon another's ground. It has been
proven conclusively that they can not worship together around the grave of the Saviour of the
World in peace. The chapel of the Syrians is not handsome; that of the Copts is the humblest
of them all. It is nothing but a dismal cavern, roughly hewn in the living rock of the Hill of
Calvary. In one side of it two ancient tombs are hewn, which are claimed to be those in which
Nicodemus and Joseph of Aramathea were buried.

</p><p>
As we moved among the great piers and pillars of another part of the church, we came upon
a party of black-robed, animal-looking Italian monks, with candles in their hands, who were
chanting something in Latin, and going through some kind of religious performance around a
disk of white marble let into the floor. It was there that the risen Saviour appeared to Mary
Magdalen in the likeness of a gardener. Near by was a similar stone, shaped like a star -- here
the Magdalen herself stood, at the same time. Monks were performing in this place also. They
perform everywhere -- all over the vast building, and at all hours. Their candles are always
flitting about in the gloom, and making the dim old church more dismal than there is any
necessity that it should be, even though it is a tomb.

</p><p>
We were shown the place where our Lord appeared to His mother after the Resurrection.
Here, also, a marble slab marks the place where St. Helena, the mother of the Emperor
Constantine, found the crosses about three hundred years after the Crucifixion. According to the
legend, this great discovery elicited extravagant demonstrations of joy. But they were of short
duration. The question intruded itself: "Which bore the blessed Saviour, and which the thieves?"
To be in doubt, in so mighty a matter as this -- to be uncertain which one to adore -- was a
grievous misfortune. It turned the public joy to sorrow. But when lived there a holy priest who
could not set to simple a trouble as this at rest?  One of these soon hit
</p><hr /><i>Page 562</i><br /><p>
upon a plan that would
be a certain test. A noble lady lay very ill in Jerusalem. The wise priests ordered that the three
crosses be taken to her bedside one at a time. It was done. When her eyes fell upon the first
one, she uttered a scream that was heard beyond the Damascus Gate, and even upon the Mount
of Olives, it was said, and then fell back in a deadly swoon. They recovered her and brought
the second cross. Instantly she went into fearful convulsions, and it was with the greatest
difficulty that six strong men could hold her. They were afraid, now, to bring in the third cross.
They began to fear that possibly they had fallen upon the wrong crosses, and that the true cross
was not with this number at all. However, as the woman seemed likely to die with the
convulsions that were tearing her, they concluded that the third could do no more than put her
out of her misery with a happy dispatch. So they brought it, and behold, a miracle! The woman
sprang from her bed, smiling and joyful, and perfectly restored to health. When we listen to
evidence like this, we cannot but believe. We would be ashamed to doubt, and properly, too.
Even the very part of Jerusalem where this all occurred is there yet. So there is really no room
for doubt.

</p><p>The priests tried to show us, through a small screen, a fragment of the genuine
Pillar of Flagellation, to which Christ was bound when they scourged him. But we could not see
it, because it was dark inside the screen. However, a baton is kept here, which the pilgrim
thrusts through a hole in the screen, and then he no longer doubts that the true Pillar of
Flagellation is in there. He can not have any excuse to doubt it, for he can feel it with the stick.
He can feel it as distinctly as he could feel any thing.

</p><p>
Not far from here was a niche where they used to preserve a piece of the True Cross, but it
is gone, now. This piece of the cross was discovered in the sixteenth century. The Latin priests
say it was stolen away, long ago, by priests of another sect. That seems like a hard statement
to make, but we know very well that it was stolen, because we have seen it ourselves in several
of the cathedrals of Italy and France.
</p><hr /><i>Page 563</i><br />
<p>
But the relic that touched us most was the plain old sword of that stout Crusader, Godfrey of
Bulloigne -- King Godfrey of Jerusalem. No blade in Christendom wields such enchantment as
this -- no blade of all that rust in the ancestral halls of Europe is able to invoke such visions of
romance in the brain of him who looks upon it -- none that can prate of such chivalric deeds or
tell such brave tales of the warrior days of old. It stirs within a man every memory of the Holy
Wars that has been sleeping in his brain for years, and peoples his thoughts with mail-clad
images, with marching armies, with battles and with sieges. It speaks to him of Baldwin, and
Tancred, the princely Saladin, and great Richard of the Lion Heart. It was with just such blades
as these that these splendid heroes of romance used to segregate a man, so to speak, and leave
the half of him to fall one way and the other half the other. This very sword has cloven
hundreds of Saracen Knights from crown to chin in those old times when Godfrey wielded it.
It was enchanted, then, by a genius that was under the command of King Solomon. When danger
approached its master's tent it always struck the shield and clanged out a fierce alarm upon the
startled ear of night. In times of donbt, or in fog or darkness, if it were drawn from its sheath
it wonld point instantly toward the foe, and thus reveal the way -- and it would also attempt to
start after them of its own accord. A Christian could not be so disguised that it would not know
him and refuse to hurt him -- nor a Moslem so disguised that it would not leap from its scabbard
and take his life. These statements are all well authenticated in many legends that are among the
most trustworthy legends the good old Catholic monks preserve. I can never forget old
Godfrey's sword, now. I tried it on a Moslem, and clove him in twain like a doughnut. The
spirit of Grimes was upon me, and if I had had a graveyard I would have destroyed all the
infidels in Jerusalem. I wiped the blood off the old sword and handed it back to the priest -- I did
not want the fresh gore to obliterate those sacred spots that crimsoned its brightness one day six
hundred years ago and thus gave Godfrey warning that before the sun went down his journey
of life would end.
</p><hr /><i>Page 564</i><br />
<p>Still moving through the gloom of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre we came to
a small chapel, hewn out of the rock -- a place which has been known as "The Prison of Our
Lord" for many centuries. Tradition says that here the Saviour was
</p><hr /><i>Page 565</i><br /><p>
confined just previously to
the crucifixion. Under an altar by the door was a pair of stone stocks for human legs. These
things are called the "Bonds of Christ," and the use they were once put to has given them the
name they now bear.

</p><p>The Greek Chapel is the most roomy, the richest and the showiest chapel in the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its altar, like that of all the Greek churches, is a lofty screen that
extends clear across the chapel, and is gorgeous with gilding and pictures. The numerous lamps
that hang before it are of gold and silver, and <a name="x">cost great sums.</a>

</p><p>
But the feature of the place is a short column that rises from the middle of the marble
pavement of the chapel, and marks the exact <i>centre of the earth. </i>The most reliable
traditions tell us that this was known to be the earth's centre, ages ago, and that when Christ
was upon earth he set all doubts upon the subject at rest forever, by stating with his own lips
that the tradition was correct. Remember, He said that that particular column stood upon the
centre of the world. If the centre of the world changes, the column changes its position accord-
ingly. This column has moved three different times of its own accord. This is because, in great
convulsions of nature, at three different times, masses of the earth -- whole ranges of mountains,
probably -- have flown off into space, thus lessening the diameter of the earth, and changing the
exact locality of its centre by a point or two. This is a very curious and interesting circumstance,
and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who would make us believe that it is not possible
for any portion of the earth to fly off into space.

</p><p>
To satisfy himself that this spot was really the centre of the earth, a sceptic once paid well for
the privilege of ascending to the dome of the church to see if the sun gave him a shadow at
noon. He came down perfectly convinced. The day was very clondy and the sun threw no
shadows at all; but the man was satisfied that if the sun had come out and made shadows it could
not have made any for him. Proofs like these are not to be set aside by the idle tongues of
cavilers. To such as are not bigoted, and are willing to be convinced, they carry a conviction
that nothing can ever shake.
</p><hr /><i>Page 566</i><br />
<p>If even greater proofs than those I have mentioned are wanted, to satisfy the
headstrong and the foolish that this is the genuine centre of the earth, they are here. The greatest
of them lies in the fact that from under this very column was taken the <i>dust from which
Adam was made. </i>This can surely be regarded in the light of a settler. It is not likely that
the original first man would have been made from an inferior quality of earth when it was
entirely convenient to get first quality from the world's centre. This will strike any reflect ing
mind forcibly. That Adam was formed of dirt procured in this very spot is amply proven by the
fact that in six <a name="g">thousand</a> years no man has ever been able to prove that the dirt was <i>not
</i>procured here whereof he was made.
</p><p>
It is a singular circumstance that right under the roof of this same great church, and not far
away from that illustrious column, Adam himself, the father of the human race, lies buried.
There is no question that he is actually buried
</p><hr /><i>Page 567</i><br /><p>
in the grave which is pointed out as his -- there can
be none -- because it has never yet been proven that that grave is not the grave in which he is
buried.

</p>
<p>
<a name="7">The tomb of Adam!</a> How touching it was, here in a land of strangers, far away
from home, and friends, and all who cared for me, thus to discover the grave of a blood
relation. True, a distant one, but still a relation. The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its
recognition. The fountain of my filial aflfection was stirred to its profoundest depths, and I gave
way to tumultuous emotion. I leaned upon a pillar and burst into tears. I deem it no shame to
have wept over the grave of my poor dead relative. Let him who would sneer at my emotion
close this volume here, for he will find little to his taste in my journeyings through Holy Land.
Noble old man -- he did not live to see me -- he did not live to see his child. And I -- I -- alas, I did
not live to see <i>him</i>. Weighed down by sorrow and disappointment, he died before
I was born -- six thousand brief summers before I was born. But let us try to bear it with
fortitude. Let us trust that he is better off where he is. Let us take comfort in the thought that
his loss is our eternal gain.

</p><p>
The next place the guide took us to in the holy church was an altar dedicated to the Roman
soldier who was of the military guard that attended at the Crucifixion to keep order, and
who -- when the vail of the Temple was rent in the awful darkness that followed; when the rock
of Golgotha was split asunder by an earthquake; when the artillery of heaven thundered, and in
the baleful glare of the lightnings the shrouded dead flitted about the streets of Jerusalem -- shook
with fear and said, "Surely this was the Son of God!" Where this altar stands now, that Roman
soldier stood then, in full view of the crucified Saviour -- in full sight and hearing of all the
marvels that were transpiring far and wide about the circumference of the Hill of Calvary. And
in this self-same spot the priests of the Temple beheaded him for those blasphemous words he
had spoken.

</p><p>In this altar they used to keep one of the most curious relics
</p><hr /><i>Page 568</i><br /><p>
that human eyes ever
looked upon -- a thing that had power to fascinate the beholder in some mysterious way and keep
him gazing for hours together. It was nothing less than the copper plate Pilate put upon the
Saviour's cross, and upon which he wrote, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."  I think St.
Helena, the mother of Constantine, found this wonderful memento when she was here in the
third century. She traveled all over Palestine, and was always fortunate. Whenever the good old
enthusiast found a thing mentioned in her Bible, Old or New, she would go and search for that
thing, and never stop until she found it. If it was Adam, she would find Adam; if it was the
Ark, she would find the Ark; if it was Goliath, or Joshua, she would find <i>them.</i> She found the
inscription here that I was speaking of, I think. She found it in this very spot, close to where
the martyred Roman soldier stood. That copper plate is in one of the churches in Rome, now.
Any one can see it there. The inscription is very distinct.

</p><p>We passed along a few steps and saw the altar built over the very spot where the
good Catholic priests say the soldiers divided the raiment of the Saviour.

</p><p>
Then we went down into a cavern which cavilers say was once a cistern. It is a chapel, now,
however -- the Chapel of St. Helena. It is fifty-one feet long by forty-three wide. In it is a marble
chair which Helena used to sit in while she superintended her workmen when they were digging
and delving for the True Cross. In this place is an altar dedicated to St. Dimas, the penitent
thief. A new bronze statue is here -- a statue of St. Helena. It reminded us of poor Maximilian,
so lately shot. He presented it to this chapel when he was about to leave for his throne in
Mexico.

</p><p>
From the cistern we descended twelve steps into a large roughly-shaped grotto, carved wholly
out of the living rock. Helena blasted it out when she was searching for the true Cross. She had
a laborious piece of work, here, but it was richly rewarded. Out of this place she got the crown
of thorns, the nails of the cross, the true Cross itself, and the cross of the penitent thief.  When
she thought she had found every
</p><hr /><i>Page 569</i><br /><p>
thing and was about to stop, she was told in a dream to continue
a day longer. It was very fortunate. She did so, and found the cross of the other thief.

</p><p>The walls and roof of this grotto still weep bitter tears in memory of the event
that transpired on Calvary, and devout pilgrims groan and sob when these sad tears fall upon
them from the dripping rock. The monks call this apartment the "Chapel of the Invention of the
Cross" -- a name which is unfortunate, because it leads the ignorant to imagine that a tacit
acknowledgment is thus made that the tradition that Helena found the true Cross here is a
fiction -- an invention. It is a happiness to know, however, that intelligent people do not doubt
the story in any of its particulars.

</p><p>
Priests of any of the chapels and denominations in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre can visit
this sacred grotto to weep and pray and worship the gentle Redeemer. Two different
congregations are not allowed to enter at the same time, however, because they always fight.

</p><p>
Still marching through the venerable Church of the Holy Sepulchre, among chanting priests
in coarse long robes and sandals; pilgrims of all colors and many nationalities, in all sorts of
strange costumes; under dusky arches and by dingy piers and columns; through a sombre
cathedral gloom freighted with smoke and incense, and faintly starred with scores of candles that
appeared suddenly and as suddenly disappeared, or drifted mysteriously hither and thither about
the distant aisles like ghostly jack-o'-lanterns -- we came at last to a small chapel which is called
the "Chapel of the Mocking." Under the altar was a fragment of a marble column; this was the
seat Christ sat on when he was reviled, and mockingly made King, crowned with a crown of
thorns and sceptred with a reed. It was here that they blindfolded him and struck him, and said
in derision, "Prophesy who it is that smote thee." The tradition that this is the identical spot of
the mocking is a very ancient one. The guide said that Saewulf was the first to mention it. I do
not know Saewulf, but still, I cannot well refuse to receive his evidence -- none of us can.
</p><hr /><i>Page 570</i><br />
<p>They showed us where the great Godfrey and his brother Baldwin, the first
Christian Kings of Jerusalem, once lay buried by that sacred sepulchre they had fought so long
and so valiantly to wrest from the hands of the infidel. But the niches that had contained the
ashes of these renowned crusaders were empty. Even the coverings of their tombs were
gone -- destroyed by devout members of the Greek Church, because Godfrey and Baldwin were
Latin princes, and had been reared in a Christian faith whose creed differed in some unimportant
respects from theirs.

</p><p>We passed on, and halted before the tomb of Melchisedek! You will remember
Melchisedek, no doubt; he was the King who came out and levied a tribute on Abraham the time
that he pursued Lot's captors to Dan, and took all their property from them. That was about four
thousand years ago, and Melchisedek died shortly afterward. However, his tomb is in a good
state of preservation.

</p><p>
When one enters the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Sepulchre itself is the first thing he
desires to see, and really is almost the first thing he does see. The next thing he has a strong
yearning to see is the spot where the Saviour was crucified. But this they exhibit last. It is the
crowning glory of the place. One is grave and thoughtful when he stands in the little Tomb of
the Saviour -- he could not well be otherwise in such a place -- but he has not the slightest possible
belief that ever the Lord lay there, and so the interest he feels in the spot is very, very greatly
marred by that reflection. He looks at the place where Mary stood, in another part of the church,
and where John stood, and Mary Magdalen; where the mob derided the Lord; where the angel
sat; where the crown of thorns was found, and the true Cross; where the risen Saviour
appeared -- he looks at all these places with interest, but with the same conviction he felt in the
case of the Sepulchre, that there is nothing genuine about them, and that they are imaginary holy
places created by the monks. But the place of the Crucifixion affects him differently. He fully
believes that he is looking upon the very spot where the Savior gave up his
</p><hr /><i>Page 571</i><br /><p>
life. He remembers
that Christ was very celebrated, long before he came to Jerusalem; he knows that his fame was
so great that crowds followed him all the time; he is aware that his entry into the city produced
a stirring sensation, and that his reception was a kind of ovation; he can not overlook the fact
that when he was crucified there were very many in Jerusalem who believed that he was the true
Son of God. To publicly execute such a personage was sufficient in itself to make the locality
of the execution a memorable place for ages; added to this, the storm, the darkness, the
earthquake, the rending of the vail of the Temple, and the untimely waking of the dead, were
events calculated to fix the execution and the scene of it in the memory of even the most
thoughtless witness. Fathers would tell their sons about the strange affair, and point out the spot;
the sons would transmit the story to their children, and thus a period of three hundred years
would easily be spanned* -- at which time Helena came and built a church upon Calvary to
commemorate the death and burial of the Lord and preserve the sacred place in the memories
of men; since that time there has always been a church there. It is not possible that there can
be any mistake about the locality of the Crucifixion. Not half a dozen persons knew where they
buried the Saviour, perhaps, and a burial is not a startling event, any how; therefore, we can
be pardoned for unbelief in the Sepulchre, but not in the place of the Crucifixion. Five hundred
years hence there will be no vestige of Bunker Hill Monument left, but America will still know
where the battle was fought and where Warren fell. The crucifixion of Christ was too notable
an event in Jerusalem, and the Hill of Calvary made too celebrated by it, to be forgotten in the
short space of three hundred years. I climbed the stairway in the church which brings one to the
top of the small inclosed pinnacle of rock, and looked upon the place where the true cross once
stood, with a far more absorbing interest than I had ever felt in any thing earthly before. I could
not believe that the


</p><p><font size="-1">
* The thought is Mr. Prime's, not mine, and is full of good sense. I borrowed it from his
    "Tent Life." -- M. T.</font></p>

<hr /><i>Page 572</i><br />
<p>three holes in the top of the rock were the actual ones the crosses stood in, but I
felt satisfied that those crosses had stood so near the place now occupied by them, that the few
feet of possible difference were a matter of no consequence.

</p><p>When one stands where the Saviour was crucified, he finds it all he can do to
keep it strictly before his mind that Christ was not crucified in a Catholic Church. He must
remind himself every now and then that the great event transpired in the open air, and not in a
gloomy, candle-lighted cell in a little corner of a vast church, up-stairs -- a small cell all
bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation, in execrable taste.

</p><p>
Under a marble altar like a table, is a circular hole in the marble floor, corresponding with
the one just under it in which the true Cross stood. The first thing every one does is to kneel
down and take a candle and examine this hole. He does this strange prospecting with an amount
of gravity that can never be estimated or appreciated by a man who has not seen the operation.
Then he holds his candle before a richly engraved picture of the Saviour, done on a messy slab
of gold, and wonderfully rayed and starred with diamonds, which hangs above the hole within
the altar, and his solemnity changes to lively admiration. He rises and faces the finely wrought
figures of the Saviour and the malefactors uplifted upon their crosses behind the altar, and bright
with a metallic lustre of many colors. He turns next to the figures close to them of the Virgin
and Mary Magdalen; next to the rift in the living rock made by the earthquake at the time of the
Crucifixion, and an extension of which he had seen before in the wall of one of the grottoes
below; he looks next at the show-case with a figure of the Virgin in it, and is amazed at the
princely fortune in precious gems and jewelry that hangs so thickly about the form as to hide
it like a garment almost. All about the apartment the gaudy trappings of the Greek Church
offend the eye and keep the mind on the rack to remember that this is the Place of the Cruci-
fixion -- Golgotha -- the Mount of Calvary. And the last thing he looks at is that which was also
the first -- the place where the true Cross stood. That will chain him to the spot and
</p><hr /><i>Page 573</i><br /><p>
compel him
to look once more, and once again, after he has satisfied all curiosity and lost all interest
concerning the other matters pertaining to the locality.

</p><p>And so I close my chapter on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre -- the most sacred
locality on earth to millions and millions of men, and women, and children, the noble and the
humble, bond and free. In its history from the first, and in its tremendous associations, it is the
most illustrious edifice in Christendom. With all its clap-trap side-shows and unseemly
impostures of every kind, it is still grand, reverend, venerable -- for a god died there; for fifteen
hundred years its shrines have been wet with the tears of pilgrims from the earth's remotest
confines; for more than two hundred, the most gallant knights that ever wielded sword wasted
their lives away in a struggle to seize it and hold it sacred from infidel pollution. Even in our
own day a war, that cost millions of treasure and rivers of blood, was fought because two rival
nations claimed the sole right to put a new dome upon it. History is full of this old Church of
the Holy Sepulchre -- full of blood that was shed because of the respect and the veneration in
which men held the last resting-place of the meek and lowly, the mild and gentle, Prince of
Peace!
