<h3><i>Innocents Abroad</i>: CHAPTER LIV.</h3>

<hr><i>Page 572</i><br>

<p>WE were standing in a narrow street, by the Tower of Antonio. "On
these stones that are crumbling away," the guide said, "the Saviour sat
and rested before taking up the cross. This is the beginning of the
Sorrowful Way, or the Way of Grief." The party took note of the sacred
spot, and moved on. We passed under the "Ecce Homo Arch," and saw the
very window from which Pilate's wife warned her husband to have nothing
to do with the persecution of the Just Man. This window is in an
excellent state of preservation, considering its great age. They showed
us where Jesus rested the second time, and where the mob refused to give
him up, and said, "Let his blood be upon our heads, and upon our
children's children forever." The French Catholics are building a church
on this spot, and with their usual veneration for historical relics, are
incorporating into the new such scraps of ancient walls as they have
found there. Further on, we saw the spot where the fainting Saviour fell
under the weight of his cross.  A great granite column of some ancient
temple lay there at the time, and the heavy cross struck it such a blow
that it broke in two in the middle.  Such was the guide's story when he
halted us before the broken column.

</p><p>We crossed a street, and came presently to the former residence of
St. Veronica. When the Saviour passed there, she came out, full of
womanly compassion, and spoke pitying words to him, undaunted by the
hootings and the threatenings of the mob, and wiped the perspiration from
his face with her handkerchief.  We had heard so much of St. Veronica,
and seen

<hr><i>Page 575</i><br>

her picture by so many masters, that it was like meeting an old friend
unexpectedly to come upon her ancient home in Jerusalem. The strangest
thing about the incident that has made her name so famous, is, that when
she wiped the perspiration away, the print of the Saviour's face remained
upon the handkerchief, a perfect portrait, and so remains unto this day.
We knew this, because we saw this handkerchief in a cathedral in Paris,
in another in Spain, and in two others in Italy. In the Milan cathedral
it costs five francs to see it, and at St. Peter's, at Rome, it is almost
impossible to see it at any price. No tradition is so amply verified as
this of St. Veronica and her handkerchief.

</p><p>At the next corner we saw a deep indention in the hard stone
masonry of the corner of a house, but might have gone heedlessly by it
but that the guide said it was made by the elbow of the Saviour, who
stumbled here and fell. Presently we came to just such another indention
in a stone wall. The guide said the Saviour fell here, also, and made
this depression with his elbow.

</p><p>There were other places where the Lord fell, and others where he
rested; but one of the most curious landmarks of ancient history we found
on this morning walk through the crooked lanes that lead toward Calvary,
was a certain stone built into a house -- a stone that was so seamed and
scarred that it bore a sort of grotesque resemblance to the human face.
The projections that answered for cheeks were worn smooth by the
passionate kisses of generations of pilgrims from distant lands. We asked
"Why ?" The guide said it was because this was one of "the very stones of
Jerusalem " that Christ mentioned when he was reproved for permitting the
people to cry "Hosannah !" when he made his memorable entry into the city
upon an ass. One of the pilgrims said, "But there is no evidence that the
stones <i>did</i> cry out -- Christ said that if the people stopped from
shouting Hosannah, the very stones <i>would</i> do it." The guide was
perfectly serene. He said, calmly, "This is one of the stones that
<i>would</i> have cried out.  "It was of little use to try to shake this
fellow's simple faith -- it was easy to see that.


<hr><i>Page 576</i><br>

</p><p>And so we came at last to another wonder, of deep and abiding
interest -- the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who
has been celebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred
years as the Wandering Jew. On the memorable day of the Crucifixion he
stood in this old doorway with his arms akimbo, looking out upon the
struggling mob that was approaching, and when the weary Saviour would
have sat down and rested him a moment, pushed him rudely away and said,
"Move on!" The Lord said, "Move on, thou, likewise," and the command has
never been revoked from that day to this. All men know how that the
miscreant upon whose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down the
wide world, for ages and ages, seeking rest and never finding it --
courting death but always in vain -- longing to stop, in city, in
wilderness, in desert solitudes, yet hearing always that relentless
warning to march -- march on! They say -- do these hoary traditions --
that when Titus sacked Jerusalem and slaughtered eleven hundred thousand
Jews in her streets and by�ways, the Wandering Jew was seen always in the
thickest of the fight, and that when battle�axes gleamed in the air, he
bowed his head beneath them; when swords flashed their deadly lightnings,
he sprang in their way; he bared his breast to whizzing javelins, to
hissing arrows, to any and to every weapon that promised death and
forgetfulness, and rest. But it was useless -- he walked forth out of the
carnage without a wound.  And it is said that five hundred years
afterward he followed Mahomet when he carried destruction to the cities
of Arabia, and then turned against him, hoping in this way to win the
death of a traitor. His calculations were wrong again. No quarter was
given to any living creature but one, and that was the only one of all
the host that did not want it. He sought death five hundred years later,
in the wars of the Crusades, and offered himself to famine and pestilence
at Ascalon. He escaped again -- he could not die. These repeated
annoyances could have at last but one effect -- they shook his
confidence.  Since then the Wandering Jew has carried on a kind of
desultory toying with the most promising of the aids

<hr><i>Page 577</i><br>

and implements of destruction, but with small hope, as a general thing.
He has speculated some in cholera and railroads, and has taken almost a
lively interest in infernal machines and patent medicines. He is old,
now, and grave, as becomes an age like his; he indulges in no light
amusements save that he goes sometimes to executions, and is fond of
funerals.

</p><p>There is one thing he can not avoid; go where he will about the
world, he must never fail to report in Jerusalem every fiftieth year.
Only a year or two ago he was here for the thirty�seventh time since
Jesus was crucified on Calvary. They say that many old people, who are
here now, saw him then, and had seen him before. He looks always the same
-- old, and withered, and hollow�eyed, and listless, save that there is
about him something which seems to suggest that he is looking for some
one, expecting some one -- the friends of his youth, perhaps.  But the
most of them are dead,now. He always pokes about the

<hr><i>Page 578 </i><br>

old streets looking lonesome, making his mark on a wall here and there,
and eyeing the oldest buildings with a sort of friendly half interest;
and he sheds a few tears at the threshold of his ancient dwelling, and
bitter, bitter tears they are. Then he collects his rent and leaves
again. He has been seen standing near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on
many a starlight night, for he has cherished an idea for many centuries
that if he could only enter there, he could rest. But when he approaches,
the doors slam to with a crash, the earth trembles, and all the lights in
Jerusalem burn a ghastly blue! He does this every fifty years, just the
same. It is hopeless, but then it is hard to break habits one has been
eighteen hundred years accustomed to. The old tourist is far away on his
wanderings, now. How he must smile to see a pack of blockheads like us,
galloping about the world, and looking wise, and imagining we are finding
out a good deal about it ! He must have a consuming contempt for the
ignorant, complacent asses that go skurrying about the world in these
railroading days and call it traveling.

</p><p>When the guide pointed out where the Wandering Jew had left his
familiar mark upon a wall, I was filled with astonishment. It read:

"S T. -- 1860 -- X."

</p><p>All I have revealed about the Wandering Jew can be amply proven by
reference to our guide.

</p><p>The mighty Mosque of Omar, and the paved court around it, occupy
<i>a fourth part</i> of Jerusalem. They are upon Mount Moriah, where King
Solomon's Temple stood. This Mosque is the holiest place the Mohammedan
knows, outside of Mecca. Up to within a year or two past, no Christian
could gain admission to it or its court for love or money. But the
prohibition has been removed, and we entered freely for bucksheesh.

</p><p>I need not speak of the wonderful beauty and the exquisite grace
and symmetry that have made this Mosque so celebrated  -- because I did
not see them. One can not see such things at an instant glance -- one
frequently only finds out how really beautiful a really beautiful woman
is after considerable


<hr><i>Page 579</i><br>

acquaintance with her; and the rule applies to Niagara Falls, to majestic
mountains and to mosques -- especially to mosques.

</p><p>The great feature of the Mosque of Omar is the prodigious rock in
the centre of its rotunda. It was upon this rock that Abraham came so
near offering up his son Isaac -- this, at least, is authentic��it is
very much more to be relied on than most of the traditions, at any rate.
On this rock, also, the angel stood and threatened Jerusalem, and David
persuaded him to spare the city. Mahomet was well acquainted with this
stone. From it he ascended to heaven. The stone tried to follow him, and
if the angel Gabriel had not happened by the merest good luck to be there
to seize it, it would have done it. Very few people have a grip like
Gabriel -- the prints of his monstrous fingers, two inches deep, are to
be seen in that rock to�day.

</p><p>This rock, large as it is, is suspended in the air. It does not
touch any thing at all. The guide said so. This is very wonderful. In the
place on it where Mahomet stood, he left his foot�prints in the solid
stone. I should judge that he wore about eighteens. But what I was going
to say, when I spoke of the rock being suspended, was, that in the floor
of the cavern under it they showed us a slab which they said covered a
hole which was a thing of extraordinary interest to all Mohammedans,
because that hole leads down to perdition, and every soul that is
transferred from thence to Heaven must pass up through this orifice.
Mahomet stands there and lifts them out by the hair. All Mohammedans
shave their heads, but they are careful to leave a lock of hair for the
Prophet to take hold of. Our guide observed that a good Mohammedan would
consider himself doomed to stay with the damned forever if he were to
lose his scalp�lock and die before it grew again. The most of them that I
have seen ought to stay with the damned, any how, without reference to
how they were barbered.

</p><p>For several ages no woman has been allowed to enter the cavern
where that important hole is. The reason is that one of the sex was once
caught there blabbing every thing she


<hr><i>Page 580</i><br>

knew about what was going on above ground, to the rapscallions in the
infernal regions down below. She carried her gossiping to such an extreme
that nothing could be kept private  -- nothing could be done or said on
earth but every body in perdition knew all about it before the sun went
down. It was about time to suppress this woman's telegraph, and it was
promptly done. Her breath subsided about the same time.

</p><p>The inside of the great mosque is very showy with variegated
marble walls and with windows and inscriptions of elaborate mosaic. The
Turks have their sacred relics, like the Catholics. The guide showed us
the veritable armor worn by the great son�in�law and successor of
Mahomet, and also the buckler of Mahomet's uncle. The great iron railing
which surrounds the rock was ornamented in one place with a thousand rags
tied to its open work. These are to remind Mahomet not to forget the
worshipers who placed them there.  It is considered the next best thing
to tying threads around his finger by way of reminders.

</p><p>Just outside the mosque is a miniature temple, which marks the
spot where David and Goliah used to sit and judge the people.*

</p><p>Every where about the Mosque of Omar are portions of pillars,
curiously wrought altars, and fragments of elegantly carved marble --
precious remains of Solomon's Temple. These have been dug from all depths
in the soil and rubbish of Mount Moriah, and the Moslems have always
shown a disposition to preserve them with the utmost care. At that
portion of the ancient wall of Solomon's Temple which is called the Jew's
Place of Wailing, and where the Hebrews assemble every Friday to kiss the
venerated stones and weep over the fallen greatness of Zion, any one can
see a part of the unquestioned and undisputed Temple of Solomon, the same
consisting of three or four stones lying one upon the other, each of
which is about twice as long as a seven�octave piano, and about as thick
as such a piano is high. But, as I have remarked before, it is


<br><br><font size="-1">* A pilgrim informs me that it was not David and
Goliah, but David and Saul.  I stick to my own statement �� the guide
told me, and he ought to know.</font>

<hr><i>Page 581</i><br>

only a year or two ago that the ancient edict prohibiting Christian
rubbish like ourselves to <i>enter</i> the Mosque of Omar and see the
costly marbles that once adorned the inner Temple was annulled. The
designs wrought upon these fragments are all quaint and peculiar, and so
the charm of novelty is added to the deep interest they naturally
inspire. One meets with these venerable scraps at every turn, especially
in the neighboring Mosque el Aksa, into whose inner walls a very large
number of them are carefully built for preservation. These pieces of
stone, stained and dusty with age, dimly hint at a grandeur we have all
been taught to regard as the princeliest ever seen on earth; and they
call up pictures of a pageant that is familiar to all imaginations --
camels laden with spices and treasure --  beautiful slaves, presents for
Solomon's harem -- a long cavalcade of richly caparisoned beasts and
warriors -- and Sheba's Queen in the van of this vision of "Oriental
magnificence." These elegant fragments bear a richer interest than the
solemn vastness of the stones the Jews kiss in the Place of Wailing can
ever have for the heedless sinner.

</p><p>Down in the hollow ground, underneath the olives and the

<hr><i>Page 582</i><br>

orange�trees that flourish in the court of the great Mosque, is a
wilderness of pillars -- remains of the ancient Temple; they supported
it. There are ponderous archways down there, also, over which the
destroying "plough " of prophecy passed harmless. It is pleasant to know
we are disappointed, in that we never dreamed we might see portions of
the actual Temple of Solomon, and yet experience no shadow of suspicion
that they were a monkish humbug and a fraud.

</p><p>We are surfeited with sights. Nothing has any fascination for us,
now, but the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. We have been there every day,
and have not grown tired of it; but we are weary of every thing else. The
sights are too many. They swarm about you at every step; no single foot
of ground in all Jerusalem or within its neighborhood seems to be without
a stirring and important history of its own. It is a very relief to steal
a walk of a hundred yards without a guide along to talk unceasingly about
every stone you step upon and drag you back ages and ages to the day when
it achieved celebrity.

</p><p>It seems hardly real when I find myself leaning for a moment on a
ruined wall and looking <i>listlessly</i> down into the historic pool of
Bethesda. I did not think such things <i>could</i> be so crowded together
as to diminish their interest. But in serious truth, we have been
drifting about, for several days, using our eyes and our ears more from a
sense of duty than any higher and worthier reason. And too often we have
been glad when it was time to go home and be distressed no more about
illustrious localities.

</p><p>Our pilgrims compress too much into one day. One can gorge sights
to repletion as well as sweetmeats. Since we breakfasted, this morning,
we have seen enough to have furnished us food for a year's reflection if
we could have seen the various objects in comfort and looked upon them
deliberately. We visited the pool of Hezekiah, where David saw Uriah's
wife coming from the bath and fell in love with her.

</p><p>We went out of the city by the Jaffa gate, and of course were told
many things about its Tower of Hippicus.

</p><p>We rode across the Valley of Hinnom, between two of the

<hr><i>Page 583</i><br>

Pools of Gihon, and by an aqueduct built by Solomon, which still conveys
water to the city. We ascended the Hill of Evil Counsel, where Judas
received his thirty pieces of silver, and we also lingered a moment under
the tree a venerable tradition says he hanged himself on.

</p><p>We descended to the canon again, and then the guide began  to give
name and history to every bank and boulder we came to: "This was the
Field of Blood; these cuttings in the rocks were shrines and temples of
Moloch; here they sacrificed children; yonder is the Zion Gate; the
Tyropean Valley, the Hill of Ophel; here is the junction of the Valley of
Jehoshaphat -- on your right is the Well of Job." We turned up
Jehoshaphat. The recital went on. "This is the Mount of Olives; this is
the Hill of Offense; the nest of huts is the Village of Siloam; here,
yonder, every where, is the King's Garden; under this great tree
Zacharias, the high priest, was murdered; yonder is Mount Moriah and the
Temple wall; the tomb of Absalom; the tomb of St. James; the tomb of
Zacharias; beyond, are the Garden of Gethsemane and the tomb of the
Virgin Mary; here is the Pool of Siloam, and -- "

</p><p>We said we would dismount, and quench our thirst, and rest. We
were burning up with the heat. We were failing under the accumulated
fatigue of days and days of ceaseless marching. All were willing.

</p><p>The Pool is a deep, walled ditch, through which a clear stream of
water runs, that comes from under Jerusalem somewhere, and passing
through the Fountain of the Virgin, or being supplied from it, reaches
this place by way of a tunnel of heavy masonry. The famous pool looked
exactly as it looked in Solomon's time, no doubt, and the same dusky,
Oriental women, came down in their old Oriental way, and carried off jars
of the water on their heads, just as they did three thousand years ago,
and just as they will do fifty thousand years hence if any of them are
still left on earth.

</p><p>We went away from there and stopped at the Fountain of the Virgin.
But the water was not good, and there was no comfort or peace any where,
on account of the regiment of boys


<hr><i>Page 584</i><br>
and girls and beggars that persecuted us all the time for bucksheesh. The
guide wanted us to give them some money, and we did it; but when he went
on to say that they were starving to death we could not but feel that we
had done a great sin in throwing obstacles in the way of such a desirable
consummation, and so we tried to collect it back, but it could not be
done.

</p><p>We entered the Garden of Gethsemane, and we visited the Tomb of
the Virgin, both of which we had seen before. It is not meet that I
should speak of them now. A more fitting time will come.

</p><p>I can not speak now of the Mount of Olives or its view of
Jerusalem, the Dead Sea and the mountains of Moab; nor of the Damascus
Gate or the tree that was planted by King Godfrey of Jerusalem. One ought
to feel pleasantly when he talks of these things. I can not say any thing
about the stone column that projects over Jehoshaphat from the Temple
wall like a cannon, except that the Moslems believe Mahomet will sit
astride of it when he comes to judge the world. It is a pity he could not
judge it from some roost of his own in Mecca, without trespassing on our
holy ground. Close by is the Golden Gate, in the Temple wall -- a gate
that was an elegant piece of sculpture in the time of the Temple, and is
even so yet. From it, in ancient times, the Jewish High Priest turned
loose the scapegoat and let him flee to the wilderness and bear away his
twelve�month load of the sins of the people. If they were to turn one
loose now, he would not get as far as the Garden of Gethsemane, till
these miserable vagabonds here would gobble him up,* sins and all.
<i>They</i> wouldn't care. Mutton�chops and sin is good enough living for
them. The Moslems watch the Golden Gate with a jealous eye, and an
anxious one, for they have an honored tradition that when it falls,
Islamism will fall and with it the Ottoman Empire. It did not grieve me
any to notice that the old gate was getting a little shaky.

</p><p>We are at home again. We are exhausted. The sun has roasted us,
almost.</p>

<p><center><font size="-1">*Favorite pilgrim
expression.</center></font></p>

<hr><i>Page 585</i><br>

</p><p>We have full comfort in one reflection, however. Our experiences
in Europe have taught us that in time this fatigue will be forgotten; the
heat will be forgotten; the thirst, the tiresome volubility of the guide,
the persecutions of the beggars  -- and then, all that will be left will
be pleasant memories of Jerusalem, memories we shall call up with always
increasing interest as the years go by, memories which some day will
become all beautiful when the last annoyance that incumbers them shall
have faded out of our minds never again to return. School�boy days are no
happier than the days of after life, but we look back upon them
regretfully because we have forgotten our punishments at school, and how
we grieved when our marbles were lost and our kites destroyed -- because
we have forgotten all the sorrows and privations of that canonized epoch
and remember only its orchard robberies, its wooden sword pageants and
its fishing holydays. We are satisfied. We can wait. Our reward will
come. To us, Jerusalem and to�day's experiences will be an enchanted
memory a year hence --  memory which money could not buy from us. </p>
