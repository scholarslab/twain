        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tangier</h2><br />

        <p>This is royal! Let those who went up through Spain make
        the best of it--these dominions of the Emperor of Morocco
        suit our little party well enough. We have had enough of
        Spain at Gibraltar for the present. Tangier is the spot we
        have been longing for all the time. Elsewhere we have found
        foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people, but
        always with things and people intermixed that we were
        familiar with before, and so the novelty of the situation
        lost a deal of its force. We wanted something thoroughly
        and uncompromisingly foreign--foreign from top to
        bottom--foreign from center to circumference--foreign
        inside and outside and all around--nothing anywhere about
        it to dilute its foreignness--nothing to remind us of any
        other people or any other land under the sun. And lo! In
        Tangier we have found it. Here is not the slightest thing
        that ever we have seen save in pictures--and we always
        mistrusted the pictures before. We cannot anymore. The
        pictures used to seem exaggerations--they seemed too weird
        and fanciful for reality. But behold, they were not wild
        enough--they were not fanciful enough--they have not told
        half the story. Tangier is a foreign land if ever there was
        one, and the true spirit of it can never be found in any
        book save <i>The Arabian Nights.</i> Here are no white men
        visible, yet swarms of humanity are all about us. Here is a
        packed and jammed city enclosed in a massive stone wall
        which is more than a thousand years old. All the houses
        nearly are one- and two-story, made of thick walls of
        stone, plastered outside, square as a dry goods box, flat
        as a floor on top, no cornices, whitewashed all over--a
        crowded city of snowy tombs! And the doors are arched with
        the peculiar arch we see in Moorish pictures; the floors
        are laid in varicolored diamond flags; in tessellated,
        many-colored porcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of
        Fez; in red tiles and broad bricks that time cannot wear;
        there is no furniture in the rooms (of Jewish dwellings)
        save divans--what there is in Moorish ones no man may know;
        within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter. And
        the streets are oriental--some of them three feet wide,
        some six, but only two that are over a dozen; a man can
        blockade the most of them by extending his body across
        them. Isn't it an oriental picture?</p>
