        <p>Of all the lands on earth for dismal scenery, I think
        Palestine must be the prince. The hills are barren, they
        are dull of color, they are unpicturesque in shape. The
        valleys are unsightly deserts fringed with a feeble
        vegetation that has an expression about it of being ashamed
        of itself. The Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee--mere lakes
        they are--sleep in the midst of a vast stretch of hill and
        plain wherein the eye rests upon no pleasant tint, no
        striking object, no soft picture dreaming in a purple haze
        or mottled with the shadow of the clouds. Every outline is
        harsh, every feature is distinct, there is no
        perspective--distance works no enchantment here. It is the
        most hopeless, dreary, heartbroken piece of territory out
        of Arizona. I think the sun would skip it if he could make
        schedule time by going around. What Palestine wants is
        paint. It will never be a beautiful country until it is
        painted. Each detachment of pilgrims ought to give it a
        coat, and build walls at short distances, so that one could
        not see too much landscape at once. The children of Israel
        wandered about the desert beyond Jordan where we camped,
        and marched into Canaan with songs of rapture and
        rejoicing; and it is a wonder to me that they didn't pack
        up and march out of it again. That they refrained from
        doing it speaks volumes for the desolation of the
        wilderness. But then, all those that had seen Egypt were
        dead. That fact is mildly suggestive. I speak as if Canaan
        had never been a better country than it is now. I have much
        better judgment than to say that there is considerable
        evidence that it has not changed in any respect in four
        thousand years--evidence that there was not any chance for
        it to change for the worse--evidence that from the date of
        its creation the difference between it and a "wilderness"
        was not more perceptible than the difference between one
        Chinaman and another. I refrain from saying these things,
        not because they might not savor somewhat of truth, but
        because they could not be popular.</p>

        <p>But the severest thing that has been said about
        Palestine was said here in Jerusalem. A pilgrim with his
        periodical ecstasy upon him (it usually comes in a flush of
        happiness after dinner) finished his apostophe with, "O,
        that I could be here at the Second Advent!"</p>

        <p>A grave gentleman said, "It will not occur in
        Palestine."</p>

        <p>"What"</p>

        <p>"The Second Advent will take place elsewhere--possibly
        in America."</p>

        <p>"Blasphemy!"</p>

        <p>"I speak reasonably. You are in the Holy Land. You have
        seen the Holy Land once?"</p>

        <p>"Yes."</p>

        <p>"Shall you ever want to come here again?"</p>

        <p>"Well--no."</p>

        <p>"My friend, the Savior has been here once!"</p>
