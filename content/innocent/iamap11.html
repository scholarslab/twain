        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; A Well in the Holy Land</h3><br />

        <p>We descended to the Plain again, and halted a moment at
        a well -- of Abraham's time, no doubt. It was in a desert
        place. It was walled three feet above ground with squared
        and heavy blocks of stone, after the manner of Bible
        pictures. Around it some camels stood, and others knelt.
        There was a group of sober little donkeys with naked, dusky
        children clambering about them, or sitting astride their
        rumps, or pulling their tails. Tawny, black-eyed,
        barefooted maids, arrayed in rags and adorned with brazen
        armlets and pinchbeck ear-rings, were poising waterjars
        upon their heads, or drawing water from the well. A flock
        of sheep stood by, waiting for the shepherds to fill the
        hollowed stones with water, so that they might drink --
        stones which, like those that walled the well, were worn
        smooth and deeply creased by the chafing chins of a hundred
        generations of thirsty animals. Picturesque Arabs sat upon
        the ground, in groups, and solemnly smoked their
        longstemmed chibouks. Other Arabs were filling black
        hog-skins with water -- skins which, well filled, and
        distended with water till the short legs projected
        painfully out of the proper line, looked like the corpses
        of hogs bloated by drowning. Here was a grand Oriental
        picture which I had worshiped a thousand times in soft,
        rich steel engravings! But in the engraving there was no
        desolation; no dirt; no rags; no fleas; no ugly features;
        no sore eyes; no feasting flies; no besotted ignorance in
        the countenances; no raw places on the donkeys' backs; no
        disagreeable jabbering in unknown tongues; no stench of
        camels; no suggestion that a couple of tons of powder
        placed under the party and touched off would heighten the
        effect and give to the scene a genuine interest and a charm
        which it would always be pleasant to recall, even though a
        man lived a thousand years. Oriental scenes look best in
        steel engravings. I cannot be imposed upon any more by that
        picture of the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon. I shall say
        to myself, You look fine, Madam but your feet are not clean
        and you smell like a camel.</p>
