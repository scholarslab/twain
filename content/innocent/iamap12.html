        <h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Sphinx</h1><br />

        <p>After years of waiting it was before me at last. The
        great face was so sad, so earnest, so longing, so patient.
        There was a dignity not of earth in its mien, and in its
        countenance a benignity such as never anything human wore.
        It was stone, but it seemed sentient. If ever image of
        stone thought, it was thinking. It was looking toward the
        verge of the landscape, yet looking <i>at</i> nothing --
        nothing but distance and vacancy. It was looking over and
        beyond everything of the present and far into the past. It
        was gazing out over the ocean of time -- over lines of
        century waves, which further and further receding, closed
        nearer and nearer together, and blended at last into one
        unbroken tide, away toward the horizon of remote antiquity.
        It was thinking of the wars of departed ages; of the
        empires it had seen created and destroyed; of the nations
        whose birth it had witnessed, whose progress it had
        watched, whose annihilation it had noted; of the joy and
        sorrow, the life and death, the grandeur and decay, of five
        thousand slow revolving years. It was the type of an
        attribute of man -- of a faculty of his heart and brain. It
        was M<font size="-1">EMORY</font> -- R<font size=
        "-1">ETRIBUTION</font> -- wrought into visible, tangible
        form. All who know what pathos there is in memories of days
        that are accomplished and faces that have vanished --
        albeit only a trifling score of years gone by -- will have
        some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave
        eyes that look so steadfastly back upon the things they
        knew before History was born -- before Tradition had being
        -- things that were and forms that moved in a vague era
        which even Poetry and Romance scarce know of -- and passed
        one by one away and left the stony dreamer solitary in the
        midst of a strange new age and uncomprehended scenes.</p>

        <p>The sphinx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in
        its magnitude; it is impressive in the mystery that hangs
        over its story. And there is that in the overshadowing
        majesty of this eternal figure of stone, with its accusing
        memory of the deeds of all ages, which reveals to one
        something of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last
        in the awful presence of God.</p>

        <p>There are some things which, for the credit of America,
        should be left unsaid perhaps; but these very things happen
        sometimes to be the very things which, for the real benefit
        of Americans, ought to have prominent notice. While we
        stood looking, a wart or excresence of some kind appeared
        on the jaw of the sphinx. We heard the familiar clink of a
        hammer and understood the case at once. One of our
        well-meaning reptiles -- I mean relic-hunters -- had
        crawled up there and was trying to break a "specimen" from
        the face of this the most majestic creation the hand of man
        has wrought. But the great image contemplated the dead ages
        as calmly as ever, unconscious of the small insect that was
        fretting at its jaw. Egyptian granite that has defied the
        storms and earthquakes of all time has nothing to fear from
        the tackhammers of ignorant excursionists -- highwaymen --
        like this specimen. He failed in his enterprise. We sent a
        sheikh to arrest him if he had the authority, or to warn
        him, if he had not, that by the laws of Egypt the crime he
        was attempting to commit was punishable with imprisonment
        or the bastinado. Then he desisted and went away.</p>
