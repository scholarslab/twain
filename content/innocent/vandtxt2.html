  <p>In conclusion I will observe that even galloping as we did
  about the world, we learned something. The lesson of the
  Excursion was a good one. It taught us that foreign countries are
  excellent to travel in, but that the best country to live in is
  America, after all. We found no soap in the hotels of Europe,
  &amp; they charged us for candles we never burned. We saw no
  ladies anywhere that were as beautiful as our own ladies here at
  home &amp; especially in this audience. We saw none anywhere that
  dressed with such excellent taste as do our ladies at home here.
  I am not a married man, but -- but -- I would like to be. I only
  mention it in the most casual way, though, &amp; -- do not mean
  anything -- anything personal by it. We saw no government on the
  other side <i>like our own</i> -- not <i>just</i> like our own.
  The Sultan's was a little like it. One of his great officers came
  into office without a cent, &amp; went out in a few years &amp;
  built himself a palace worth 3 million. It brought tears to my
  eyes in that far foreign land -- it was so like home. . . .</p>

  <p>We saw no energy in the capitals of Europe like the tremendous
  energy of New York, &amp; we saw no place where intelligence
  &amp; enterprise were so widely diffused as they are here in our
  country. We saw nowhere any architectural achievement that was so
  beautiful to the eye as the national capitol of America, at
  Washington, &amp; we saw nowhere any building that was -- that
  was --just like our Washington Monument. We saw no people
  anywhere so self-denying, &amp; patriotic &amp; prompt in
  collecting their salaries as our own members of Congress. We saw
  nothing in Europe, Asia or Africa to make us wish to live there,
  &amp; when the voyage was done (&amp; it was a very, very
  pleasant one, take it all together), we were glad to get back to
  our own country where moral &amp; religious freedom prevail --
  where politicians are incorruptible, -- where accident policies
  are cheap &amp; where the chances to get your money back are good
  on all railroads.</p>
