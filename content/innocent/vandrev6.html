  -- Mark Twain, (Clemens,) held forth to a full house in Rouse's
  Opera House last evening. The house was a full as comfort would
  allow. His subject, "The American Vandal Abroad," suggested
  something of reproof, but the wit and humor that tempered the
  speech made every one forget everything but that. The public owe
  the lecture committee thanks for providing for them such an
  entertainment. They have begun well. Let them keep on in the ways
  of well doing and they will find their account in the full houses
  and plethoric treasury which will be secured them. We give them
  credit for <i>one</i>.</p><br />

    <font size="+1"><b>Mark Twain's Lecture.</b></font>
  </center>

  <p>The second regular lecture of the Library Course was
  delivered, last evening, by Samuel Clemens, popularly known as
  "Mark Twain," the humorist, who became known to the public a few
  years ago as a correspondent of the <i>Alta Californian</i> of
  San Francisco, and who is now employed on the editorial staff of
  the New York <i>Tribune</i>. His subject was "The American Vandal
  Abroad."</p>

  <p>He was introduced by E.W. Coy. The lecturer accompanied the
  Quaker City expedition to the Bermudas, Paris, the Crimea,
  Constantinople, Palestine, and various points on the
  Mediterranean sea.</p>

  <p>It did not exactly embarrass him to be introduced in this
  public manner, but it did remind him of those European guides who
  brought out every old relic and described it with a trite story
  and who if interrupted were obliged to begain again at the
  beginning. After the party learned the distinguishing
  characteristics of these guides, they all determined to affect as
  much imbecility as possible and they were equal to the task. The
  surgeon of the ship was capable of asking the stupidest questions
  without moving a muscle. One guide showed the handwriting of
  Columbus. The Dr. inquired who he was, if he was dead, if his
  parents were dead, and informed the dumbfounded guide that plenty
  of boys in America could beat that, and if he had any good
  respectable penmanship, let him bring it on. After conducting
  them through the Vatican without eliciting any remarks of
  surprise, the poor guide showed a mummy, one of the most
  remarkable and best preserved. The Dr., true to his calling,
  inquired, "What did you remark that his name was? How calm and
  placid! Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>The true American vandal is not remarkably well versed in
  sciences, arts and antiquities, but is sure to be perfectly at
  home anywhere, and is bound to be surprised at everything and
  extract wonders from the most trifling objects. He will half
  smoke himself to death in trying to smoke a long-stemmed pipe
  <i>a la</i> Turk, but will swear it good. He will go into
  ecstasies over the insufferable horrors of a Turkish bath, though
  he is thinking the while that he shall never live to come out. He
  will bandy words with the cockney soldier about the
  impregnability of Gibraltar. He will stand unabashed in the
  presence of one Pope, two or three Kings and Grandees
  innumerable, and will stand unawed, unsubdued, and pick his teeth
  before the venerable, time-honored, time-defying placid face of
  the Sphinx.</p>

  <p>Such an irrepressible vandal was that surgeon of the ship, who
  pretended to be a doctor and perhaps he was, for he could handle
  more unpronounceable Greek and Latin technical terms, than any
  sensible man on earth. The surgeon was called upon by the
  captain's son to prescribe for a horizontal parralax.</p>

  <p>The true home of the vandal is Paris. He drinks champagne in
  large quantities, attends all the plays, weeps when the crowd
  weeps, and spats and stamps when other people do the same, though
  he cannot tell the dialogue from the scenery. He learns to talk
  French so well in six weeks that he is constantly abusing the
  Parisians for not knowing their own language. He knew one, who,
  on his return, failed to answer the salutations of his friends,
  he had become so familiar with his adopted name that he found it
  difficult to recognize his original one.</p>

  <p>After doing Paris he generally goes to Genoa to see the
  birth-place of Columbus and get a stone from the very house where
  he was born. It has been estimated that all the stones taken from
  that house, if collected, would build one 14,000 feet long and
  16,000 feet high.</p>

  <p>He generally takes mementoes from each place. One of the party
  succeeded well till getting to the Crimea. Nothing could be found
  but the hip bone of a horse. The traveler captured it and
  labelled it "the jaw of a Russian General." Travelers' labels are
  not always reliable. They found a work of art which represented a
  man being skinned alive. It was wonderfully life like; it had
  such an expression! A man skinned alive would be apt to give his
  attention to that particular work -- unless his attention
  happened to be called some other way. It wasn't pleasant to view
  works of that nature; one is apt to dream about it afterwards.
  Still it reminded him of a scene in early life. He was required
  to sleep in his father's office, and one evening, as the moon was
  rising, he thought he was almost sure there was something on the
  floor of the room. He felt a little curious to know -- didn't
  feel anxious -- kept watching and discovered the white features
  of a dead man! He had been brought there to have sentence passed
  upon him -- that is an inquest -- and he was found guilty! He
  never felt so sick in all his life, never felt so much like
  taking a walk. He didn't feel in a hurry, not in the least
  agitated, but he went out of the window, took the sash with him,
  not that he wanted anything of the sash, but it seemed very
  convenient to take it along.</p>

  <p>The vandal visits Venice that has existed as a republic for
  1400 years, and laughs to scorn the armies and navies of the
  world. Here is where Shylock used to loan money on human flesh --
  and other collaterals. Here he hears the song of the romantic
  gondolier. The lecturer heard the song of the romantic gondolier;
  let him sing about four minutes, and suppressed him and did a
  good job. His private opinion is, though he hates to oppose Byron
  and such, but his private opinion is, that the gondolier is a
  humbug -- as a singer. But not too fast. It is grand to glide
  down street in a gondola instead of a street car. Business men
  step out, put on their gloves, and glide down to their counting
  rooms. The ladies kiss good-bye, play all the secret deceptions
  of the sex in our own land, but keep the gondolier waiting
  instead of the private carriage. The go shopping just the same
  and compel the poor clerks to lay down tons of silks, bombazines,
  corduroys and the like, and then buy a paper of pins and have it
  sent home by the errand boy. Ladies there, are the same angels as
  at home, have dresses cut "bias," and have their back hair held
  up by a crupper just the same way.</p>

  <p>The old doctor wanted to see Scylla and Charybdis. He was up
  at night with his everlasting spyglass. Some one asked what he
  wanted, "Wanted," said he, "man you do not know me! I want to see
  all the places mentioned in the Bible!" Explanation was made, and
  he exclaimed, "There's another night's rest gone. I thought it
  was Sodom and Gomorrah."</p>

  <p>The vandal finally spreads himself abroad to Athens. He
  approaches the grand old city in its silence, as it lies at his
  feet as if seen from a balloon. Nowhere else in the world can
  another such picture be seen. He would digress to tell an
  anecdote, because he might forget it and because it had a moral.
  One of the party on board the Quaker City had a chronic habit of
  speech-making; it was natural, he could not help it. They sat in
  their tent one evening in the holy land and our speech-maker
  called the attention of a sailor to the mountains in the
  distance: "There, Jack, is the Mountain of Moab. For ought we
  know you may now be resting your eyes on the very spot of the
  mysterious grave of Moses." "Moses who?" said Jack. "Why, you
  ignorant booby! Moses led the children of Israel through the
  wilderness, 300 miles in forty years." "In forty years!" said
  Jack;. "Why, Ben Holliday would have put them through in
  forty-eight hours!"</p>

  <p>It was a singular sight to stand before the Emperor of all the
  Russias; a plain, common spoken man, dressed in no better clothes
  than any of them; probably had no better. He might open his
  mouth, and ships would depart on his errands, armies collect for
  his service, a thousand trains fly at his bidding; yet his
  cordiality was sincere and he stood the only European monarch who
  welcomed them in their true capacity, as American sovereigns. He
  spoke of this, because the Emperor is the only true friend we
  have among the monarchs of the other side of the water. He felt
  on first-rate terms with Alexander. Alexander gave him freedom to
  scatter himself around at pleasure and leave just when he
  pleased. He showed that he was possessed of a heart, rather an
  uncommon thing for monarchs to have.</p>

  <p>His passages descriptive of the Sphinx, a moonlight ride in
  Venice, and the appearance of Athens from the surmounting
  eminence, were really eloquent and finished. He is unmistakably a
  man of high natural ability and considerable culture, and could
  not fail to make his mark in other than his chosen themes. As a
  satirist and humorist, he places no dependence upon uncouth
  spelling or local vernacular. He has an easy, don't-carative
  manner and a little of the swagger of the traditional Yankee
  joker without a single low or ungrammatical phrase.</p></td></tr></table>
