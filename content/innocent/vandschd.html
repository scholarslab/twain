        <p>The schedule at left doubtless contains errors. It has
        been compiled from a number of sources -- most importantly,
        <i>Mark Twain's Letters</i>, Vol. 2 (ed. Harriet Elinor
        Smith &amp; Richard Bucci); <i>The Love Letters of Mark
        Twain</i> (ed. Dixon Wecter); <i>Mark Twain's Letters to
        Mrs. Fairbanks</i> (ed. Wecter); and the accounts of the
        tour in Lorch's <i>Trouble Begins at Eight</i> and Fatout's
        <i>Mark Twain on the Lecture Circuit</i>. It was then
        checked against the schedule published in an appendix to
        <i>Mark Twain's Letters</i>, Vol. 3 (ed. Victor Fischer
        &amp; Michael B. Frank).</p>

        <p>The schedule is designed to allow you to join the tour
        in two different ways. When a date on the list appears as
        an active link, clicking on it will take you to an excerpt
        from a letter by MT about that performance. Whenever a city
        name appears as an active link, it will take you to a local
        review of that performance.</p>

        <p>Cleveland was one of MT's home bases during the tour.
        Besides beginning there, and returning for a benefit
        lecture there on January 23, he several times stayed over
        at the Fairbanks' house between other lectures. But the
        center of his attention was Elmira, N.Y, where Olivia
        Langdon lived. Throughout the tour he was courting her as
        well as the approval American audiences. After his Elmira
        performance in November, he was accepted as a suitor. He
        cancelled several shows, and sometimes traveled out of his
        way, to get to Elmira as often as possible. And during a
        break in early February she and her family accepted his
        proposal of marriage.</p>

        <p>He himself was dissatisfied with his performance in
        Elmira, apologizing to the audience at the end. But there
        is reason to think that his success on the tour, the
        evidence it gave of his rising star, helped persuade Livy's
        family to endorse his suit. Because he registered with
        Redpath late in the booking season, and because lyceum
        committees were waiting to see how his early lectures went
        before inviting him, his itinerary was inefficient. Its
        gaps and criss-crossings increased his expenses, so that
        all told he netted less than $2000 from the tour. On the
        other hand by the time it was over he had succeeded as a
        claimant for both love and popularity in the East. By the
        next lecture season he was in high demand as a performer,
        and as soon as the 1869-1870 tour ended he and Olivia
        Langdon got married. (There is interesting evidence of the
        way MT interlinked these two successes -- on stage and in
        private -- especially in <a href="twichel.html">the letters
        he wrote</a> announcing the success of his courtship.)</p>
