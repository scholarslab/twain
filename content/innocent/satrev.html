          <p>Every traveller on the Continent has met the American
          tourist, and formed some opinion of his merits. We do not
          speak of that variety of American who comes over to spend
          five or six years in Europe and finds himself rather more
          at home on the Parisian boulevards than on the New York
          Broadway. Nor do we refer to the Americans who have been
          too highly cultivated to obtrude their national
          peculiarities upon us in any disagreeable form. There is
          no pleasanter acquaintance than the gentleman, or still
          more the lady, of this class who has just enough American
          flavour to be amusingly original. But, besides these
          types, the United States are kind enough to provide us
          with a vast number of travellers corresponding in
          refinement and intelligence to Mr. Cook's tourists. They
          are the people who do Europe in six weeks, and throw in
          the Holy Land and Egypt to fill up their spare time. They
          are gloriously ignorant of any language but their own,
          supremely contemptuous of every country that had no
          interest in the Declaration of Independence, and
          occasionally, it must be admitted, as offensive as the
          worst kind of Cockney tourist, whilst even less inclined
          to hide their light under a bushel. Comparing them with
          the most nearly analogous class of British travellers, it
          is rather hard to determine which should have the
          preference. The American is generally the noisier and
          more actively disagreeable, but, on the other hand, he
          often partly redeems his absurdity by a certain naivete
          and half-conscious humour. He is often laughing in his
          sleeve at his own preposterous brags, and does not take
          himself quite so seriously as his British rival. He is
          vulgar, and even ostentatiously and atrociously vulgar;
          but the vulgarity is mixed with a real shrewdness which
          rescues it from simple insipidity. We laugh at him, and
          we would rather not have too much of his company; but we
          do not feel altogether safe in despising him. We may save
          ourselves the trouble of any further attempts at
          description by quoting a few illustrative passages from
          the book before us. Mr. Mark Twain, as the author chooses
          to call himself, is a Californian humourist after the
          fashion of Artemus Ward. He came to Europe on a grand
          excursion trip, and describes his impressions of France
          and Italy in the true tourist style. He parades his utter
          ignorance of Continental languages and manners, and
          expresses his very original judgments on various wonders
          of art and nature with a praiseworthy frankness. We are
          sometimes left in doubt whether he is speaking in all
          sincerity, or whether he is having a sly laugh at himself
          and his readers. To do him justice, however, we must
          observe that he has a strong tinge of the peculiar
          national humour; and, though not equal to the best
          performers on the same instrument, manages to be an
          amusing representative of his class. The dry joke, which
          apes seriousness, is a favourite device of his
          countrymen; and Mr. Mark Twain is of course not as simple
          as he affects to be. We merely say this to guard
          ourselves against the imputation of taking a professional
          jester seriously; but, whether he speaks in downright
          earnest or with a half-concealed twinkle of the eye, his
          remarks will serve equally well as an illustration of the
          genuine unmistakable convictions of many of his
          countrymen.</p>

          <p>Without further preface we will quote some of Mr.
          Twain's remarks upon foreign countries. And, first of
          all, he exhibits that charming ignorance of all languages
          but English which is so common amongst his fellows.
          French newspapers, he tells us, "have a strange fashion
          of telling a perfectly straight story till you get to the
          nub' of it, and then a word drops in that no man can
          translate, and that story is ruined." He is seriously
          aggrieved by the names of places, and says that the
          nearest approach which anybody can make to the true
          pronunciation of Dijon is "demijohn." The spelling is not
          much assistance under such circumstances. Speaking of a
          certain distinguished artist, he observes, "they spell it
          Vinci, and pronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell
          better than they pronounce." Gentlemen who labour under
          this difficulty of communicating with the natives
          naturally fall into the hands of guides, and Mr. Twain
          and his friends appear to have suffered terribly from the
          persons whom they hired to take them to the sights of
          foreign towns. Their system on arriving at any large
          place was to engage a <i>valet de place,</i> whom they
          always called "Ferguson," to save the trouble of
          pronouncing a new name, and were carried about as
          helpless victims to such places as he preferred, besides
          having to swallow his stories. They took a characteristic
          revenge, which appears to have afforded them immense
          satisfaction. The way to bully your guide is to affect a
          profound ignorance -- if you have not got it naturally --
          and a stony indifference to his information. They
          therefore told off a gentleman called the Doctor, to ask
          questions of the said guide, because he could "look more
          like an inspired idiot, and throw more imbecility into
          the tone of his voice, than any man that lives. It comes
          natural to him." Thus, for example, it was assumed that
          as Americans they would take a special interest in an
          autograph letter of Columbus. The Doctor, after asking
          some irrelevant questions, pronounced it the worst
          specimen of handwriting he ever saw, and added, "If you
          have got any specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot
          them out; and, if you haven't, drive on." The guide, we
          are told, was "considerably shaken up." On the same
          principle, when shown an Egyptian monument, the Doctor
          asked indignantly, "What is the use of imposing your vile
          secondhand carcases on us? If you've got a nice fresh
          corpse, fetch him out! or, by George, we'll brain you."
          The most irritating question you can put to such a guide
          is to ask concerning any distinguished character to whom
          he refers -- such, for example, as Columbus or Michael
          Angelo -- "Is he dead?" And this seems to have met with
          such success that Mr. Twain scarcely restrained his
          companions from putting the inquiry to a monk in a
          Capuchin convent, who showed them some of the personal
          remains of his predecessors.</p>

          <p>We may imagine the temper in which some of the
          remarkable sights of the Old World would be contemplated
          under such circumstances. Mr. Twain, indeed, was much
          impressed by the cathedral at Milan. The bill for mere
          workmanship, he says, "foots up six hundred and
          eighty-four millions of francs, thus far (considerably
          over a hundred millions of dollars), and it is estimated
          that it will take a hundred and twenty years yet to
          finish the cathedral." When he gets to St. Peter's,
          however, he declares that it did not look nearly so large
          as the capitol at Washington, and certainly not a
          twentieth part as beautiful from the outside. Even
          natural wonders are generally surpassed by their rivals
          in the United States. The Lake of Como, for example, is
          pronounced to be very inferior to Lake Tahoe. In
          clearness it is not to be compared to it. "I speak," he
          says, "of the north shore of Lake Tahoe, where we can
          count the scales on a trout at a depth of 180 feet." Mr.
          Twain, however, feels constrained to add, "I have tried
          to get this statement off at par here, but with no
          success; so I have been obliged to negotiate it at fifty
          per cent. discount." Tahoe, we may explain in passing,
          for the benefit of philological readers, is Indian for
          grasshopper soup -- so, at least, Mr. Twain believes. The
          objects, however, against which Mr. Twain feels a special
          indignation, to which he tells us he is bound to give
          vent in spite of the remonstrances of his friends, are
          pictures by the old masters. The old masters irritate him
          incessantly; and the apparent reason of his objection is
          characteristic. "Wherever you find a Raphael, a Rubens, a
          Michael Angelo, &amp;c.," he says, "you find artists
          copying them, and the copies are always the handsomest.
          Maybe the originals were handsome when they were new, but
          they are not now." He "harbours no animosity" against the
          deluded persons who think otherwise; but he regards them
          as about as wise as men who should stand opposite a
          desert of charred stumps and say, What a noble forest!
          Michael Angelo appears to have been a special annoyance
          to him. "I never felt so fervently thankful," he
          exclaims, "so soothed, so tranquil, so filled with a
          blessed peace, as I did yesterday, when I learnt that
          Michael Angelo was dead." One would rather like to know
          how many of Mr. Cook's tourists share this feeling in
          their hearts, if they only dared to avow their ignorance
          with an equally touching frankness. Mr. Twain took his
          revenge by asking the wretched "Ferguson" of the moment,
          whenever he came to a "statoo brunzo" (Italian for a
          bronze statue), or an Egyptian obelisk, or the Forum or
          any other work of art, ancient or modern, whether it too
          was by Michael Angelo; thus at any rate making somebody
          else share in his tortures. In presence of the ancients
          he generally indulges in facetiousness of a rather low
          order. He goes, for example, to some amphitheatre and
          tries to realize the scene which it once presented. His
          most vivid picture is that of a Roman youth, who took
          "some other fellow's young lady" to a gladiatorial show
          and amused her and himself during the acts by
          "approaching the cage and stirring up the martyrs with
          his whalebone cane." But, to say the truth, Mr. Twain
          here verges upon buffoonery. Once or twice he is driven
          to what is happily described in the heading of the page
          as "general execration." Here, for example, is a burst of
          patriotic eloquence. "O, sons of classic Italy, is the
          spirit of enterprise, of self-reliance, of noble
          endeavour utterly dead within ye? Curse your indolent
          worthlessness, why don't you rob your Church?" And he is
          very great on occasion in explaining the many advantages
          of a free and independent Republic as compared with a
          land groaning under priestly dominion and grovelling
          superstition. That notion of robbing the Church occurs to
          him very forcibly at intervals, and he seems to think
          that, so far as the plan has been carried out, it is the
          best chance for Italy.</p>

          <p>Perhaps we have persuaded our readers by this time
          that Mr. Twain is a very offensive specimen of the
          vulgarest kind of Yankee. And yet, to say the truth, we
          have a kind of liking for him. There is a frankness and
          originality about his remarks which is pleasanter than
          the mere repetition of stale raptures; and his fun, if
          not very refined, is often tolerable in its way. In
          short, his pages may be turned over with amusement, as
          exhibiting more or less consciously a very lively
          portrait of the uncultivated American tourist, who may be
          more obtrusive and misjudging, but is not quite so
          stupidly unobservant as our native product. We should not
          choose either of them for our companions on a visit to a
          church or a picture-gallery, but we should expect most
          amusement from the Yankee as long as we could stand
          him.</p>
