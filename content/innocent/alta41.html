        <p>Gideon had only 32,000 men, mostly Home Guard material,
        no doubt, because when he proclaimed that all those who
        were cowardly and wanted to go home might go, 22,000 packed
        their trunks and left. Gideon was instructed that even a
        further sifting would help the army in the same way, and he
        made his remaining 10,000 step up to the pool and drink. He
        had a keen eye for a man without enterprise, and every one
        that got down on his knees to drink, he paid off and
        discharged. Those that dipped up the water in their hands
        and drank, he retained. This reduced his army to 300 men!
        He stopped then. He judged that it was not best to go on
        sifting any more. (The present inhabitants of the country
        must be a more soldierly-style of people than their
        ancestors, for they always scoop up the water in their paws
        and "lap it like a dog.")</p>

        <p>Then at dead of night Gideon placed a trumpet in each
        man's right hand, and a pitcher with a lamp in it in his
        left, and dividing the little army into three companies of
        a hundred men each, went softly and surrounded the vast
        camp of the Children of the East. It is likely that they
        would have to stand pretty wide apart to do it. At a given
        signal every man broke his pitcher and tooted his horn; the
        crash of the crockery dazzled and bewildered them, the
        chorus of the trumpets made them think a great host had
        surprised them (they kept no scouts, perhaps, and did not
        know whether there were armies in their neighborhood or
        not,) and in the excitement of the time they fell to work
        and slaughtered each other, while Gideon's band stood still
        and said never a word. A hundred and twenty thousand of the
        enemy perished on the field, and Gideon chased the other
        fifteen thousand out of the country. Your readers will
        regard these statements as extravagant, but they are
        attested in the official reports of the battle.</p>

        <p>Of all the unheard-of military strategems ever invented,
        this of Gideon's was probably the wildest the world has any
        knowledge of. Considering the astonishing success which
        distinguished it, it is amazing that no General has ever
        been shrewd enough to try it since. The commonest sagacity,
        it would seem, ought to have caused it to be adopted into
        all codes of military tactics long ago</p>
