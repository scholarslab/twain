        <p>From Elmira, where he'd gone to lecture and to court
        Olivia Langdon, MT wrote two letters on November 28 -- one
        to Mary Fairbanks, the other to Joseph Twichell. The second
        letter is in the Barrett Collection; the other can be seen
        in Wecter's <i>Mark Twain to Mrs. Fairbanks</i>. Both
        reveal the same pattern. Livy's family had accepted MT as a
        potential claimant for her hand, but neither they nor he wanted that news made
        public. He did need to share his joy with close friends,
        though, so he wrote the letters. The one to Twichell is
        boldly headed as <i><u>Private</u></i>:</p>

        <p>But while the event may be "private," when MT interpolates "[Thunders 
and Hurricanes of applause]" into the story, he's using the same kind of bracketed references to an
        audience's response that appear in many accounts
        of his performances on the lecture circuit. The invisible audience's "Thunder" can be heard on page 2, just after MT tells Twichell that Livy's parents seem willing to let their angel leave the
        house as his mate:</p>

        </center>

        <p>On the letter's last page, when MT tells his friend that Livy has agreed to allow him to correspond with her from the tour, the applause reaches "Hurricane" force:</p>

        </center>

        <p>Even alone with a <b><i>private</i></b> event, MT was
        conscious of performing for an audience. There's no doubt that he loved
        Livy -- but in part because marriage with her would mean
        acceptance of the somebody he was also trying to be as a
        public celebrity.</p>
