        <p>If there is one thing that is really cheerful in the
        world, it is cheerfulness. I have noticed it often. And I
        have noticed that when a man is right down cheerful, he is
        seldom unhappy for the time being. Such is the nature of
        man. Now I have often thought that our style of bathing was
        rather reserved than otherwise, and lacked many elements of
        cheerfulness. But you cannot say that of the Russian style.
        I watched a party of them at it this afternoon in the
        harbor, and it is really nice. The men and women, and boys
        and girls, all go in together, along about noon, and the
        men don't wear anything at all, the boys don't, the little
        girls don't, and the young women and the old women usually
        wear a single white thin garment with ruffles around the
        top of it and short sleeves, (which I have forgotten the
        name of it,) but this would be a very good apology for a
        bathing dress, if it would only stay down. But it don't do
        it. It will float up around their necks in the most
        scandalous way, and the water is clear, and yet they don't
        seem to know enough to kick up the mud on the bottom. I
        never was so outraged in my life. At least a hundred times,
        in the seven hours I stayed there, I would just have got up
        and gone away from there disgusted, if I had had any place
        to go to. Several times I had a mind to go anyhow. Why,
        those young ladies thought no more of turning somersaults,
        when I was not looking, than nothing in the world. Incensed
        as I was, I was compelled to look, most of the time, during
        this barbarous exhibition, because it forced them to make a
        show of modesty, at least. Yet it wouldn't even have
        accomplished that, if they hadn't been so fond of show
        naturally.</p>

        <p>Well, you can't conceive of it. It was awful. But
        sometimes my outraged feelings were crowded down by my
        fears for the safety of those girls. They were so reckless.
        One splendid-looking young woman went in with nothing on
        but a shawl, and she kept it wrapped around her so that I
        was afraid all the time that she would tangle her feet in
        its long fringes and drown herself. My solicitude became so
        unbearable at last that I went and signified to her that if
        she wanted to take off her shawl I would hold it for her.
        But she only kicked up her heels and dived out of sight. I
        just took her to be one of your high-flyer, mock-modest
        kind, and left her to her fate. But she was the handsomest
        girl in the party, and it was a pity to see her endangering
        her life in that way.</p>

        <p>I said to Brown: "It makes my heart bleed to look upon
        this unhallowed scene."</p>

        <p>"We better go, then," he said. "If you stay here seven
        more hours you might bleed to death."</p>

        <p>So we went away. But it was marvellously cheerful
        bathing.</p>
