  <p>And have you seen the gondolas and heard the romantic
  gondolier sing -- as only the romantic gondolier <i>can</i> sing
  -- according to the romances? <i>I</i> have heard the romantic
  gondoliers sing -- we had just entered Venice at eight in the
  evening and were floating away toward the hotel. We were poking
  dismally around in the shadows among long rows of towering
  untenanted buildings, and were very sad and disheartened and
  disappointed -- for <i>this</i> was not the Venice we had
  expected. It was at such a time as this that this ragged
  barefooted guttersnipe turned up and began to sing, true to the
  traditions of his race.</p>

  <p>I stood it for about five minutes -- and then I said:</p>

  <p>"Look here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo -- Smith -- I'm a
  pilgrim and I'm a stranger but I'm not going to stand any such
  caterwauling as that! If this thing goes on one of us has got to
  take water. It is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice have
  been blighted forever, without taxing <i>your</i> talents to make
  the matter worse. Another yelp out of you and overboard you
  go!"</p>
