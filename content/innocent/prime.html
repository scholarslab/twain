        <p>[<i>from Chapter 1, "Nunc Dimittis Domine!"</i>]<br />
        To see the sun go down beyond the Sepulchre and rise over
        the mountain of the Ascension, to bare my forehead to the
        cold dews of Gethsemane, and lave my dim eyes in the waters
        of Siloam, to sleep in the company of the infinite host
        above the oaks of Mamre, and to lie in the starlight of
        Bethlehem and catch, however faintly, some notes of the
        voices of the angels, to wash off the dust of life in the
        Jordan, to cool my hot lips at the well of Samaria, to hear
        the murmur of Gennesareth, giving me blessed sleep -- was
        not all this worth dreaming of -- worth living for -- was
        it not worth dying for?</p>

        <p>And all this I was to accomplish -- not in some dim
        future, but to-morrow -- to-morrow!</p>

        <p>Yea, there lay Holy Land and thither my pilgrim feet
        would carry me ere three suns had risen and set. [p. 2]</p>

        <p>[<i>from Chapter 18, "If I forget thee, O
        Jerusalem!"</i>]<br />
        Thus ended my rest in Jerusalem.</p>

        <p>Think not lightly of this, my friend, for it is no light
        matter to have seen the Holy City. I hesitated much before
        I visited the Holy Land. I had always reasoned somewhat in
        this way. If I were taught that the Son of God descended to
        this earth, assuming the form of a child, and was the
        reputed son of a carpenter in an American village; that he
        lived here, walked these streets, preached at these
        corners, slept in the nights on the hills of Long Island
        and New Jersey, and was finally mobbed in the public
        places, tried for some alleged crime, condemned and
        executed here; if, I say, all this were taught me, I should
        find it much more difficult to believe than I now do the
        story of his life and death in a distant land, over which
        tradition and history have cast a holy radiance. I
        therefore feared much that when I had walked the streets of
        Jerusalem, had climbed the sides of Olivet, had rested in
        the garden of Gethsemane, and visited the Holy Sepulchre,
        my faith in the divinity of the Saviour and the
        authenticity of his mission, might be seriously
        impaired.</p>

        <p>Far otherwise was the reality.</p>

        <p>Every step that I advanced on the soil of Palestine
        offered some new and startling evidence of the truth of the
        sacred story. Every hour we were exclaiming that the
        history must be true, so perfect was the proof before our
        eyes. The Bible was a new book, faith in which seemed now
        to have passed into actual sight, and every page of its
        record shone out with new, and a thousand fold increased
        lustre.</p>

        <p>The Bible had, of course, been our only guide-book.
        There is no other -- and the publication of another will
        tend materially to decrease the interest of travel in
        Syria. He who shall visit Holy Soil with Murray's proposed
        red book in his hands will know nothing of the keen
        pleasure that we experienced in studying out for ourselves
        the localities of sacred incident, or the intense delight
        that flashed across our minds when we found those startling
        confirmations of the truth of the story -- startling,
        because unexpected and wholly original.</p>

        <p>Sitting on the side of Mount Moriah, it was with new
        force we read that exquisite passage in the 46th Psalm,
        "There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the
        city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most
        High;" which had its origin unquestionably in the beautiful
        fountain that springs under the very rocks of Moriah . . .
