        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Constantinople</h2><br />

        <p>Ashore, it was -- well, it was an eternal circus. People
        were thicker than bees, in those narrow streets, and the
        men were dressed in all the outrageous, outlandish,
        idolatrous, extravagant, thunder-and-lightning costumes
        that ever a tailor with the delirium tremens and seven
        devils could conceive of. There was no freak in dress too
        crazy to be indulged in; no absurdity too absurd to be
        tolerated; no frenzy in ragged diabolism too fantastic to
        be attempted. No two men were dressed alike. It was a wild
        masquerade of all imaginable costumes -- every struggling
        throng in every street was a dissolving view of stunning
        contrasts. Some patriarchs wore awful turbans, but the
        grand mass of the infidel horde wore the fiery red
        skull-cap they call a fez. All the remainder of the raiment
        they indulged in was utterly indescribable.</p>

        <p>The shops here are mere coops, mere boxes, bath-rooms,
        closets -- any thing you please to call them -- on the
        first floor. The Turks sit cross-legged in them, and work
        and trade and smoke long pipes, and smell like -- like
        Turks. That covers the ground. Crowding the narrow streets
        in front of them are beggars, who beg forever, yet never
        collect any thing; and wonderful cripples, distorted out of
        all semblance of humanity, almost; vagabonds driving laden
        asses; porters carrying drygoods boxes as large as cottages
        on their backs; peddlers of grapes, hot corn, pumpkin
        seeds, and a hundred other things, yelling like fiends; and
        sleeping happily, comfortably, serenely, among the hurrying
        feet, are the famed dogs of Constantinople; drifting
        noiselessly about are squads of Turkish women, draped from
        chin to feet in flowing robes, and with snowy veils bound
        about their heads, that disclose only the eyes and a vague,
        shadowy notion of their features. Seen moving about, far
        away in the dim, arched aisles of the Great Bazaar, they
        look as the shrouded dead must have looked when they walked
        forth from their graves amid the storms and thunders and
        earthquakes that burst upon Calvary that awful night of the
        Crucifixion. A street in Constantinople is a picture which
        one ought to see once -- not oftener.</p>
