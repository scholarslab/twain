        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Italy</h2><br />

        <p>We saw interior Italy, now. The houses were of solid
        stone, and not often in good repair. The peasants and their
        children were idle, as a general thing, and the donkeys and
        chickens made themselves at home in drawing-room and
        bed-chamber and were not molested. The drivers of each and
        every one of the slow-moving market-carts we met were
        stretched in the sun upon their merchandise, sound asleep.
        Every three or four hundred yards, it seemed to me, we came
        upon the shrine of some saint or other--a rude picture of
        him built into a huge cross or a stone pillar by the
        road-side.--Some of the pictures of the Saviour were
        curiosities in their way. They represented him stretched
        upon the cross, his countenance distorted with agony. From
        the wounds of the crown of thorns; from the pierced side;
        from the mutilated hands and feet; from the scourged
        body--from every handbreadth of his person streams of blood
        were flowing! Such a gory, ghastly spectacle would frighten
        the children out of their senses, I should think. There
        were some unique auxiliaries to the painting which added to
        its spirited effect. These were genuine wooden and iron
        implements, and were prominently disposed round about the
        figure: a bundle of nails; the hammer to drive them; the
        sponge; the reed that supported it; the cup of vinegar; the
        ladder for the ascent of the cross; the spear that pierced
        the Saviour's side. The crown of thorns was made of real
        thorns, and was nailed to the sacred head. In some Italian
        church-paintings, even by the old masters, the Saviour and
        the Virgin wear silver or gilded crowns that are fastened
        to the pictured head with nails. The effect is as grotesque
        as it is incongruous.</p>

        <p>Here and there, on the fronts of roadside inns, we found
        huge, coarse frescoes of suffering martyrs like those in
        the shrines. It could not have diminished their sufferings
        any to be so uncouthly represented. We were in the heart
        and home of priestcraft--of a happy, cheerful, contented
        ignorance, superstition, degradation, poverty, indolence,
        and everlasting unaspiring worthlessness. And we said
        fervently, It suits these people precisely; let them enjoy
        it, along with the other animals, and Heaven forbid that
        they be molested. <i>We</i> feel no malice toward these
          fumigators.</p><img src="map5b.jpg" align="right" alt="1869 ILLUSTRATION" />

        <p>We passed through the strangest, funniest, undreampt-of
        old towns, wedded to the customs and steeped in the dreams
        of the elder ages, and perfectly unaware that the world
        turns round! And perfectly indifferent, too, as to whether
        it turns around or stands still. <i>They</i> have nothing
        to do but eat and sleep and sleep and eat, and toil a
        little when they can get a friend to stand by and keep them
        awake. <i>They</i> are not paid for thinking--<i>they</i>
        are not paid to fret about the world's concerns. They were
        were not respectable people--they were not worthy
        people--they were not learned and wise and brilliant
        people--but in their breasts, all their stupid lives long,
        resteth a peace that passeth understanding! How can men,
        calling themselves men, consent to be so degraded and
        happy.</p>
