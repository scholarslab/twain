        <p>[<i>from the Introduction</i>] The land where the
        Word-Made-Flesh dwelt amongst men must ever continue to be
        an important part of Revelation; and Palestine may be
        fairly regarded as the divinely prepared tablet whereon
        God's messages to men have been graven in ever-living
        characters. This fact invests even the geography and
        topography of the Holy Land with special importance. But
        there are other considerations which impart to it a deeper
        and more practical interest. From this land we have
        received that marvellous spriritual and figurative
        nomenclature of the Bible through which nearly all true
        religious knowledge has been communicated to men. Here it
        was devised and first used, and here are found its best
        illustrations. We learn from history that it required
        fifteen centuries of time, and an endless array of
        providential arrangements, co-operating with human and
        superhuman agents and agencies, to bring this medium of
        intercourse between God and man to the needed
        perfection.</p>

        <p>Let us, therefore, deal reverently with [the Holy Land],
        walk softly over those acres once trodden by patriarchs,
        prophets, and poets, and even by the sacred feet of the Son
        of God himself. Let us put off the sordid sandal of
        worldliness and sin as we enter this consecrated domain.
        There is design in this peculiar grouping of mountains and
        plains, hills and valleys, lakes and rivers, the desert and
        the sea, all in intimate association with the marvellous
        and miraculous incidents and phenomena recorded in the
        Bible.</p>

        <p>The Land and the Book constitute the all-perfect text of
        the Word of God, and can be best studied together. To read
        the one by the light of the other has been the privilege of
        the author for more than forty years, and the governing
        purpose in publishing is to furnish additional facilities
        for this delightful study to those who have not been thus
        exceptionally favored. [pp. 1 &amp; 3]</p>
