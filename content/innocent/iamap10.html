        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Magdala</h2><br />

        <p>M<font size="-1">AGDALA</font> is not a beautiful place.
        It is thoroughly Syrian, and that is to say that it is
        thoroughly ugly, and cramped, squalid, uncomfortable, and
        filthy--just the style of cities that have adorned the
        country since Adam's time, as all writers have labored hard
        to prove, and have succeeded. The streets of Magdala are
        any where from three to six feet wide, and reeking with
        uncleanliness. The houses are from five to seven feet high,
        and all built upon one arbitrary plan--the ungraceful form
        of a dry-goods box. The sides are daubed with a smooth
        white plaster, and tastefully frescoed aloft and alow with
        disks of camel-dung placed there to dry. This gives the
        edifice the romantic appearance of having been riddled with
        cannon-balls, and imparts to it a very warlike aspect. When
        the artist has arranged his materials with an eye to just
        proportion--the small and the large flakes in alternate
        rows, and separated by carefully-considered intervals--I
        know of nothing more cheerful to look upon than a spirited
        Syrian fresco. The flat, plastered roof is garnished by
        picturesque stacks of fresco materials, which, having
        become thoroughly dried and cured, are placed there where
        it will be convenient. It is used for fuel. There is no
        timber of any consequence in Palestine--none at all to
        waste upon fires--and neither are there any mines of coal.
        If my description has been intelligible, you will perceive,
        now, that a square, flat-roofed hovel, neatly frescoed,
        with its wall-tops gallantly bastioned and turreted with
        dried camel-refuse, gives to a landscape a feature that is
        exceedingly festive and picturesque, especially if one is
        careful to remember to stick in a cat wherever, about the
        premises, there is room for a cat to sit. There are no
        windows to a Syrian hut, and no chimneys. When I used to
        read that they let a bed-ridden man down through the roof
        of a house in Capernaum to get him into the presence of the
        Saviour, I generally had a three-story brick in my mind,
        and marveled that they did not break his neck with the
        strange experiment. I perceive now, however, that they
        might have taken him by the heels and thrown him clear over
        the house without discommoding him very much. Palestine is
        not changed any since those days, in manners, customs,
        architecture, or people.</p>

        <p>As we rode into Magdala not a soul was visible. But the
        ring of the horses' hoofs roused the stupid population, and
        they all came trooping out--old men and old women, boys and
        girls, the blind, the crazy, and the crippled, all in
        ragged, soiled and scanty raiment, and all abject beggars
        by nature, instinct and education. How the vermin-tortured
        vagabonds did swarm! How they showed their scars and sores,
        and piteously pointed to their maimed and crooked limbs,
        and begged with their pleading eyes for charity! We had
        invoked a spirit we could not lay. They hung to the
        horses's tails, clung to their manes and the stirrups,
        closed in on every aide in scorn of dangerous hoofs--and
        out of their infidel throats, with one accord, burst an
        agonizing and most infernal chorus: "Howajji, bucksheesh!
        howajji, bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! bucksheesh!
        bucksheesh!" I never was in a storm like that before.</p>
