        <p>It almost warrants the unbiblical enthusiasm of the
        spies of that rabble of filibusters who captured Dan. They
        said: "We have seen the land, and behold it is very
        good....A place where there is no want of anything that is
        in the earth."</p>

        <p>Well, I suppose they were pardonable. They hadn't seen
        any country but Palestine, and surely this was very good
        for Palestine. They thought that little patch was plenty
        for their six hundred men and their families. They do say
        that in the good old Bible times Palestine had a population
        of six million souls--Palestine, the promised land, a small
        strip of rocks and deserts and mountains, not equal in
        [area] to the State of Massachusetts, (which one cannot
        always see on the map of the United States without shutting
        one eye, Mrs. A.J.M.)--Palestine, where every hundred acres
        of arable land is protected by three mountains on each side
        and a desert at each end to keep it from bolting for want
        of company. I supppose Dutch Flat struck the filibustering
        spies as something extraordinary in the way of
        wide-extended fertility. At the same time, though, they
        drew it just a little strong when they said it was "a place
        where there is no want of anything that is in the earth."
        That was a <i>little</i> strong. A good deal of the north
        end of the farm had the boulders of original creation
        bedded in the soil as thick as nail-heads in a hair trunk,
        and they are there yet. Other portions of the farm lacked
        many things that are in the earth, and likewise lacked the
        capacity to produce those things. Still, it was a good
        piece of country for Palestine.</p>
