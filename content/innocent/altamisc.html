    [<i>Here are eight other brief passages from the letters MT
    wrote for the</i> Alta California <i>that he omitted or
    drastically altered when revising his work for a national
    audience, which he conceived as more genteel than the
    westerners among whom his career had begun. The arabic number
    after each passage refers to the</i> Alta <i>letter it is from;
    the roman numeral, to the chapter in</i> Innocents Abroad
    <i>based on that letter.</i>]

      From the palace to the gloomy prison is but a step--one might
      spit across the narrow canal that intervenes. &nbsp; [9,
      XXII]<br />
      <br />
      As concerns the latter [priests], it is said that God will
      take care of them--but of course that is only a matter of
      opinion. &nbsp; [10, XXV]<br />
      <br />
      Look at the grand Duomo of Florence . . . Like all other men,
      I fell down and worshipped it, but I had it in me to burn it
      down if I had a chance. &nbsp; [10, XXV]<br />
      <br />
      They crowd you--infest you--swarm about you, and sweat and
      stink, and lie, and look sneaking, and mean, and
      obsequious--the concentrated essence of the soulless,
      dust-licking scum of the earth the lower classes of the whole
      nation are! &nbsp; [13, X]<br />
      <br />
      [Jael "drove a hideous tent-pin down through" Sisera's
      "brain."] It was very funny. The gentle children of Israel,
      the race beloved, were full of amusing eccentricities. &nbsp;
      [35, XLVI]<br />
      <br />
      Thus, one by one, the splendid attractions of Palestine are
      passing away--gradually, but surely, the paint and the
      gilding are peeling from its cheap theatrical scenery and
      exposing the unsightly boards beneath. &nbsp; [41, LI]<br />
      <br />
      One of our pilgrims went up and saw the sun rise on Olivet. I
      did not hear of any other that did it. One is always jaded,
      here, always languid and weary. His brain is so worn and
      racked with the day's accumulations of knowledge when he
      comes home at night, that it is like an overloaded stomach,
      and he feels as it it would be an unspeakable relief to take
      a mental emetic and throw up everything he ever learned in
      his life. &nbsp; [48, LV]<br />
      <br />
      [The "picturesque form" of Lot's wife] no longer looms above
      the desert of the Dead Sea to remind the tourist of the doom
      that fell upon the lost cities, while at the same time it
      called painful attention to that unhappy trait of curiosity
      that takes up so much spare room in all her sex. The lowing
      herds wound slowly o'er the lea, sometime or other, and took
      her along with them, no doubt. &nbsp; [49, LV]<br />
