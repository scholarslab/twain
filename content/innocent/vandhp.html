        <p>MT first performed material from his <i>Quaker City</i>
        letters before an audience in Washington, DC, in early
        January 1868. When he went back to California that spring
        to get permission from the <i>Alta Californian</i> to use
        the letters in the book he was making for Bliss, he decided
        to give another series of lectures through eight of the
        cities and towns where he'd given his first lecture tour
        back in 1866, before leaving the frontier for the East and
        the trip to the Old World. The talk he gave was called
        "Pilgrim Life, Being a Sketch of His Notorious Voyage to
        Europe, Palestine, &amp;c." Although there were objections
        to the irreverence of his depiction of the Holy Land in the
        pulpit and the press, audiences packed theatres in San
        Francisco, Sacramento, Virginia City (Nevada) and elsewhere
        to hear him. Based on that success, MT decided before
        leaving the west coast that he wanted to use the lecture as
        the basis for a full-scale lyceum circuit tour, though he
        knew that what pleased westerners might not work with more
        refined listeners east of the Mississippi.</p>

        <p>For his first eastern lecture tour he registered with
        James Redpath's Boston Lyceum Bureau, a booking agency used
        by many of the period's most popular speakers. In October
        he revised "Pilgrim Life" as the lecture titled "The
        American Vandal Abroad" -- "That is to say," he wrote Mary
        Fairbanks, "I 'smouched' a lecture out of my book." He
        arranged to begin the tour under Mrs. Fairbanks' eye in
        Cleveland, on 17 November 1868; after speaking in over
        forty places, mainly in mid-Atlantic and middle-western
        states, he finished in early March, 1869. He spoke mainly
        in smaller cities, often just large towns, for a fixed fee
        -- "$100 a pop," as he wrote his mother.</p>

        <p>While a few reviewers were critical, mainly because a
        humorous lecturer was still an anomaly on the lyceum
        circuit, most had nothing but praise for his performance,
        and his talks were popular. Many, it seems, sold out the
        house. As MT gained confidence along the way, he came to
        see the tour as a chance to promote his forthcoming book.
        From Chicago, on 7 January 1869, he wrote the American
        Publishing Company to ask: "Why don't you issue
        prospectuses and startling advertisements now while I am
        stirring the bowels of these communities? I have big houses
        -- and more invitations to lecture than I can fill."</p>
