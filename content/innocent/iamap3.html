        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; France</h2><br />

        <p>We have come five hundred miles by rail through the
        heart of France. What a bewitching land it is! What a
        garden! Surely the leagues of bright green lawns are swept
        and brushed and watered every day and their grasses trimmed
        by the barber. Surely the hedges are shaped and measured
        and their symmetry preserved by the most architectural of
        gardeners. Surely the long straight rows of stately poplars
        that divide the beautiful landscape like the squares of a
        checkerboard are set with line and plummet, and their
        uniform height determined with a spirit level. Surely the
        straight, smooth, pure white turnpikes are jack-planed and
        sandpapered every day. How else are these marvels of
        symmetry, cleanliness, and order attained? It is wonderful.
        There are no unsightly stone walls and never a fence of any
        kind. There is no dirt, no decay, no rubbish
        anywhere--nothing that even hints at untidiness--nothing
        that ever suggests neglect. All is orderly and
        beautiful--everything is charming to the eye.</p>

        <p>We had such glimpses of the Rhone gliding along between
        its grassy banks; of cosy cottages buried in flowers and
        shrubbery; of quaint old red-tiled villages with mossy
        medieval cathedrals looming out of their midst; of wooded
        hills with ivy-grown towers and turrets of feudal castles
        projecting above the foliage; such glimpses of Paradise, it
        seemed to us, such visions of fabled fairyland!</p>

        <p>We knew then what the poet meant when he sang of:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>--thy cornfields green, and sunny vines,<br />
          O pleasant land of France!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And it <i>is</i> a pleasant land. No word describes it
        so felicitously as that one. They say there is no word for
        "home" in the French language. Well, considering that they
        have the article itself in such an attractive aspect, they
        ought to manage to get along without the word. Let us not
        waste too much pity on "homeless" France. I have observed
        that Frenchmen abroad seldom wholly give up the idea of
        going back to France some time or other. I am not surprised
        at it now.</p>
