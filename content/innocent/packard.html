          <p><i>The Innocents Abroad; or, The New Pilgrim's
          Progress,</i> is the title of Mark Twain's latest
          appearance between covers. The book is a ponderous one,
          containing over 650 pages, splendidly illustrated, and
          produced in the best style of art by the American
          Publishing Company, of Hartford. No ordinary "notice" can
          do justice to this work. In the language of many others,
          "it must be seen (and read) to be appreciated." It is a
          curious account of the famous Quaker City pleasure trip
          to the Mediterranean and the Holy Land, which was
          conceived by and executed under command of Captain
          Duncan, in the summer of 1867. There were many
          intelligent sight-seers among "the innocents"; but few,
          we are inclined to believe, who got as much out of the
          trip as did the author of this book. Mark Twain is a born
          journalist, besides being at the present time first among
          American humorists. It is, indeed, doubtful if he has
          ever had an equal; he certainly has not had in his line
          -- that of dry, self-contained, unobtrusive and pervading
          fun. There is no glare in his emanations -- no blinding
          coruscations of wit, which, flashing suddenly upon you,
          as suddenly go out, leaving you in darkness and
          uncertainty; no apparent striving after sharp effects; no
          digging in poor soil for poorer puns. What is said is
          most naturally said, and if there is humor in it, it is
          because the writer could not express it otherwise.
          Whatever may be the quality of the wine which fills your
          glass, you never feel that it is being drawn from an
          empty cask, or that its flavor is at all dependent upon
          the abundance of its supply. When Mr. Beecher was
          reprimanded for saying so many funny things in the
          pulpit, he replied, "Oh, but if you only knew the number
          of funny things I do not say!" And this is the impression
          left upon the reader of Mark Twain. Whatever good things
          he may choose to fasten with his pen, one cannot but feel
          that his best things are yet untold. There is one species
          of poor wit that Mark has not yet found it necessary to
          attempt, and we trust he never will, and that is poor
          orthography and worse grammar. It is not to be denied
          that a telling point may sometimes be made by a violent
          assault upon the barriers of "good English." Artemus Ward
          achieved some glory in this field; and his literary
          successor, Josh Billings, sometimes unearths a nugget;
          but the game thus far has not been worth the candle, and
          we doubt if it ever will be. At all events, Mark Twain
          has no such weak necessity, and we are glad of it. Some
          portions of the book are devoted to correct,
          unexaggerated descriptions of the country, and matters
          requiring historical accuracy; but there is no pretence,
          other than of a humorous and extravagant account of a
          memorable voyage. There will be those who will see in the
          descriptions of the Holy Land a conspicuous lack of
          reverence for sacred associations, and the contrast
          between this and ordinary guide-books will not need to be
          pointed out; but the artistic and effectual disposal of
          the romantic tales of tourists, which have enveloped
          these scenes with a mysterious beauty and awe not to be
          penetrated or approached, will be at least satisfactory
          to the matter-of-fact reader.</p>

          state of mental exhilaration to <a name="2">every-day

          <blockquote>
            At noon we took a swim in the Sea of Galilee--a blessed
            privilege in this roasting climate--and then lunched
            under a neglected old fig tree at the fountain they
            call Ain-et-Tin, a hundred yards from ruined Capernaum.
            Every rivulet that gurgles out of the rocks and sands
            of this part of the world is dubbed with the title of
            "fountain," and people familiar with the Hudson, the
            Great Lakes, and the Mississippi fall into transports
            of admiration over them, and exhaust their powers of
            composition in writing their praises. If all the poetry
            and nonsense that have been discharged upon the
            fountains and the bland scenery of this region were
            collected in a book, in would make a most valuable
            volume to burn.<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; During luncheon, the pilgrim enthusiasts
            of our party, who had been so light-headed and happy
            ever since they touched holy ground that they did
            little but mutter incoherent rhapsodies, could scarcely
            eat, so anxious were they to "take shipping" and sail
            in very person upon the waters that had borne the
            vessels of the Apostles. Their anxiety grew and their
            excitement augmented with every fleeting moment, until
            my fears were aroused and I began to have misgivings
            that in their present condition they might break
            recklessly loose from all considerations of prudence
            and buy a whole fleet of ships to sail in instead of
            hiring a single one for an hour, as quiet folk are wont
            to do. I trembled to think of the ruined purses this
            day's performances might result in. I could not help
            reflecting bodingly upon the intemperate zeal with
            which middle-aged men are apt to surfeit themselves
            upon a seductive folly which they have tasted for the
            first time. And yet I did not feel that I had a right
            to be surprised at the state of things which was giving
            me so much concern. These men had been taught from
            infancy to revere, almost to worship, the holy places
            whereon their happy eyes were resting now. For many and
            many a year this very picture had visited their
            thoughts by day and floated through their dreams by
            night. To stand before it in the flesh--to see it as
            they saw it now--to sail upon the hallowed sea, and
            kiss the holy soil that compassed it about; these were
            aspirations they had cherished while a generation
            dragged its lagging seasons by and left its furrows in
            their faces and its frosts upon their hair. To look
            upon this picture, and sail upon this sea, they had
            forsaken home and its idols and journeyed thousands and
            thousands of miles, in weariness and tribulation. What
            wonder that the sordid lights of work-day prudence
            should pale before the glory of a hope like theirs in
            the full splendor of its fruition? Let them squander
            millions! I said--who speaks of money at a time like
            this?<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; In this frame of mind I followed, as fast
            as I could, the eager footsteps of the pilgrims, and
            stood upon the shore of the lake, and swelled, with hat
            and voice, the frantic hail they sent after the "ship"
            that was speeding by. It was a success. The toilers of
            the sea ran in and beached their bark. Joy sat upon
            every countenance.<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; "How much?--ask him how much,
            Ferguson!--how much to take us all--eight of us and
            you--to Bethsaida, yonder, and to the mouth of Jordan,
            and to the place where the swine ran down into the
            sea--quick!--and we want to coast around
            everywhere--everywhere!--all day long! --<i>I</i> could
            sail a year in these waters!--and tell him we'll stop
            at Magdala and finish at Tiberias!--ask him how
            much!--anything--anything whatever!--tell him we don't
            care what the expense is!" (I said to myself, I knew
            how it would be.)<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Ferguson</i>--(interpreting)--"He says
            two napoleons--eight dollars."<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; One or two countenances fell. Then a
            pause.<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; "Too much!--we'll give him one!"<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall never know how it was--I shudder
            yet when I think how the place is given to
            miracles--but in a single instant of time, as it seemed
            to me, that ship was twenty paces from the shore, and
            speeding away like a frightened thing! Eight
            crest-fallen creatures stood upon the shore, and oh, to
            think of it! this--this--after all that overmastering
            ecstasy! Oh, shameful, shameful ending, after such
            unseemly boasting! It was too much like "Ho! let me at
            him!" followed by a prudent, "Two of you hold him--one
            can hold me!"
