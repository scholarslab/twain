        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Bermuda</h2><br />

        <p>Days passed--and nights; and then the beautiful Bermudas
        rose out of the sea, we entered the tortuous channel,
        steamed hither and thither among the bright summer islands,
        and rested at last under the flag of England and were
        welcome. We were not a nightmare here, where were
        civilization and intelligence in place of Spanish and
        Italian superstition, dirt and dread of cholera. A few days
        among the breezy groves, the flower gardens, the coral
        caves, and the lovely vistas of blue water that went
        curving in and out, disappearing and anon again appearing
        through jungle walls of brilliant foliage, restored the
        energies dulled by long drowsing on the ocean, and fitted
        us for our final cruise--our little run of a thousand miles
        to New York--America--<font size="-1">HOME</font>.</p>

        <p>We bade good-bye to "our friends the Bermudians," as our
        programme hath it--the majority of those we were most
        intimate with were negroes--and courted the great deep
        again. I said the majority. We knew more negroes than white
        people, because we had a deal of washing to be done, but we
        made some most excellent friends among the whites, whom it
        will be a pleasant duty to hold long in grateful
        remembrance.</p>
