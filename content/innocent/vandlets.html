  Made a <i>splendid</i> hit last night &amp; am the "lion" to-day.
  Awful rainy, sloppy night, but there were 1,200 people present,
  anyhow -- house <i>full</i>. I <i>captured</i> them, if I
  <i>do</i> say it myself. I go hence to Pittsburgh -- thence to
  Elmira, N.Y.<br />

  is born! It was most flatteringly received -- 1200 applausive
  &amp; appreciative people present.<br />

  I played against the eastern favorite, Fanny Kemble, in
  Pittsburgh, last night. She had 200 in her house, &amp; I had
  upwards of 1,500. <i>All</i> the seats were sold (in a driving
  rain storm, 3 days ago,) as reserved seats at 25 cents extra,
  even those in the second &amp; third tiers -- &amp; when the last
  seat was gone the box office had not been open more than 2 hours.
  When I reached the theatre they were turning people away &amp;
  the house was crammed. 150 or 200 stood up, all the evening. I go
  to Elmira tonight. I am simply lecturing for societies, at $100 a
  pop.<br />

  When I found myself comfortably on board the cars last night . .
  . I said to myself: "Now whatever others may think, it is
  <i>my</i> opinion that I am blessed above all other men that
  live; I have known supreme happiness for two whole days, &amp;
  now I ought to be ready &amp; willing to pay a little attention
  to necessary duties, &amp; do it cheerfully." Therefore I
  resolved to go deliberately through that lecture, without notes,
  &amp; so impress it upon my memory &amp; my understanding as to
  secure myself against any such lame delivery of it in future as
  <i>I</i> thought characterized it in Elmira. But I had little
  calculated the cost of such a resolution. Never was a lecture so
  full of parentheses before. It was Livy, Livy, Livy, Livy, all
  the way through! It was one sentence of Vandal to ten sentences
  about <i>you</i>. The insignificant lecture was hidden, lost,
  overwhelmed &amp; buried under a boundless universe of
  Livy!<br />

  I just can't estimate how many thanks I owe you, Livy, for your
  good, long, delightful letter. It <i>saved</i> me -- saved me
  from another Elmira failure before a great audience in Newark. I
  felt so heavy &amp; stupid from want of rest &amp; sleep, &amp;
  from wearing excitement at Twichell's, that when I went down town
  at noon it was with many misgivings about to-night's work. So
  much so that I began to think of leaving some of the
  <i>serious</i> paragraphs out of the lecture rather than read
  them badly. . . . [Your letter] brightened me up so much that I
  <i>knew</i> perfectly well I was entirely safe for every line of
  the lecture. I said to myself, "I can make that audience
  <i>laugh</i> whenever I please -- so I will talk the humorous to
  <i>them</i>; but when I come to the serious passages, I will
  enthrone my matchless little princess (the same being
  <i>you</i>,) in the chief seat in the house, &amp; talk
  <i>that</i> to <i>her</i>. And Livy, I would have given
  <i>anything</i> if you had really been there. <i>Then</i> you
  would have heard a lecture delivered as it <i>should</i> be
  delivered; you would have seen a lecturer perfectly at his ease;
  you would have seen a brilliant audience pretty completely at the
  mercy of the speaker, too, &amp; swung "from grave to gay, from
  lively to serene," without the least perceptible effort in the
  world. It was splendid. I <i>enjoyed</i> every sentence of the
  discourse, &amp; was sorry to quit when it was finished. I wished
  it had been before a metropolitan audience of 5,000; I could have
  persuaded them with just as much ease -- I could have carried
  them with me with just the same facility.<br />

  I was not at all satisfied with my performance in Detroit, for
  notwithstanding I had the largest audience they had seen there
  for a long time, I was awkward &amp; constrained -- ill at ease
  -- &amp; did not satisfy them, I think. But if I had only had
  your letter in my pocket, then, how different it would have been!
  . . . I can please <i>any</i> audience when I have a new letter
  of yours by me. It is because I always feel a tranquil gladness,
  a glow of happiness, then, &amp; it is easy to impart it to the
  multitude about me. Now tonight we had the largest audience that
  has ever attended any lecture here, but Gough's, &amp; I honestly
  believe I pleased every individual in the house. The applause of
  the serious passages was cordial &amp; unstinted. The gentlemen
  of the Society pledged me to come again (in case I lecture
  another season -- I always make that reservation, because I don't
  want to run about any more unless I <i>must</i>.)<br />

  Your Christmas letter arrived an hour before I went on the stage
  at Akron, last night, &amp; of course I captured <i>that</i>
  audience. It was much the largest gathering a lecture had called
  out since Gough talked there 2 years ago. It couldn't have been
  larger, for all standing room was filled. Then I went to a large
  private dancing party &amp; stayed till 12:30, though I only
  danced, 3 times. I made it up talking &amp; making friends. There
  were a large number of comely &amp; companionable young ladies
  there, &amp; the young gentlemen were cordial, intelligent &amp;
  agreeable. . . . I escaped a serenade by a brass band by going to
  the party, &amp; so escaped making a speech. I liked the friendly
  idea of the serenade, but wouldn't have enjoyed being so
  pointedly lionized.<br />

  (<i>Through a failure in his records, MT had stood up the people
  of Fort Wayne on 29 December 1868. The 2 January lecture was a
  make up date.</i>)<br />
  How they have abused me in this town, for the last two or three
  days! But they couldn't get the newspapers to do it. They said
  there was some mistake, &amp; steadfastly refused -- for which I
  am grateful. The night I <i>should</i> have lectured here, the
  house was crowded, &amp; yet there was not room for all who came.
  To-night it was rainy, slushy &amp; sloppy, &amp; only two-thirds
  of a house came. They were very cool, &amp; did not welcome me to
  the stage. They were still offended, &amp; showed it. But as soon
  as I saw that, all my distress of mind, all my wavering
  confidence, all my down-heartedness vanished, &amp; I never felt
  happier or better satisfied on a stage before. And so, within ten
  minutes we were splendid friends -- they unbent, banished their
  frowns, &amp; the affair went off gallantly. A really hearty
  opposition is inspiring, sometimes. . . .<br />

  I talked in Peoria, last night, to a large audience, &amp; one
  whose intellectual faces surprised as well as pleased me, for I
  certainly had expected no such experience in Peoria. They want me
  to come again next season, &amp; I am sure I shall like to do it
  if I am so unhappy as to be still in the lecture field. That
  audience reminded me of my Michigan audiences. Do you know, that
  with the exception, perhaps, of Mrs. Fairbanks', the Michigan
  reviews of the lecture were the best-written I have seen yet. . .

  Another botch of a lecture! -- even worse than Elmira, I think.
  And it was such a pity -- for we had a beautiful church
  <i>entirely full</i> of handsome, well-dressed, intellectual
  ladies &amp; gentlemen. They say I <i>didn't</i> botch it, but I
  should think <i>I</i> ought to know. I closed with a fervent
  apology for my failure, just as I did in Elmira -- &amp; the
  apology was the only thing in the lecture that had any life or
  feeling in it. It cuts me to the very quick to make a failure. I
  did feel so ashamed of myself. I even distressed the committee --
  I touched their hearts with my genuine suffering, &amp; real good
  fellows as they are, they came up to my room to comfort me. The
  failure was chiefly owing to an idiot president, who insisted
  upon introducing me while the people were still pouring in --
  &amp; they kept on coming in till one-fourth of the lecture had
  been delivered to an audience who were exclusively engaged in
  watching the newcomers to their seats -- it seemed that I
  <i>never</i> would get their attention. I grew so exasperated at
  last, that I shouted to the doorkeeper to close the doors &amp;
  not open them again on <i>any</i> account. But my confidence was
  gone. The church was harder to speak in than an empty barrel
  would have been. I was angry, wearied to death with travel, &amp;
  I just hobbled miserably through, apologized, bade the house
  good-night, &amp; then gave the President a piece of my mind,
  without any butter or sugar on it. And now I have to pray for
  forgiveness for these things --<br />

  I have just been doing that thing which is sometimes so hard to
  do -- making an apology. Yesterday morning, at the hotel in Iowa
  City, the landlord called me at 9 o'clock, &amp; it made me so
  mad I stormed at him with some little violence. I tried for an
  hour to go to sleep again &amp; couldn't -- I wanted that sleep
  particularly, because I wanted to write a certain thing that
  would require a clear head &amp; choice language. Finally I
  thought a cup of coffee might help the matter, &amp; was going to
  ring up for it -- no <i>bell</i>. I was mad again. When I
  <i>did</i> get the landlord up there at last, by slamming the
  door till I annoyed everybody on my floor, I showed temper again
  -- <i>&amp; he didn't</i>. See the advantage it gave him. His
  mild replies shamed me into silence, but I was still too
  obstinate, too proud, to ask his pardon. But last night, in the
  cars, the more I thought of it the more I repented &amp; the more
  ashamed I was; &amp; so resolved to make the repentance good by
  apologizing -- which I have done, in the most ample &amp;
  unmincing form, by letter, this morning. I feel satisfied &amp;
  jolly, now.<br />

  It was splendid, to-night -- the great hall was crowded full of
  the pleasantest &amp; handsomest people, &amp; I did the very
  <i>best</i> I possibly could -- &amp; did better than I ever did
  before -- I felt the importance of the occasion, for I knew that,
  this being Nasby's residence, every person in the audience would
  be comparing &amp; contrasting me with him -- &amp; <i>I</i> am

  critical at first, but presently they became warmly

  For the first time, I had to dismiss an audience last night
  without lecturing. It was a fearful storm, &amp; the people could
  not get out. Not more than a hundred were present. Perhaps I
  ought to have gone on &amp; lectured, but then the gentlemen of
  the Grand Army of the Republic had treated me so well (&amp;
  besides there was a much-prized old California friend or so among
  them,) that I hated to see them lose money, &amp; so I said I
  would foot the expense-bills &amp; dismiss the house -- but they
  wouldn't permit me to pay anything, or depart without my regular
  salary -- &amp; <i>I</i> rebelled against that. So we compromised
  -- that is, I talked to the audience a minute or two about the
  weather &amp; got them to laughing, &amp; so dismissed them in a
  good humor &amp; invited them to come back Wednesday night &amp;
  hear "the rest of the discourse" -- an invitation which nearly
  all of them accepted, for they took their tickets back, as they
  went out, instead of their money.<br />

  "Boys, I shall have to bid you a good-afternoon, for I am stupid
