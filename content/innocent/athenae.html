          <p>But for <a href="hingston.html">the Introduction to
          this book</a>, we should have little difficulty in
          assigning it its proper place in literature. We should
          say at once that the author was draping himself in the
          garb of one of those typical Yankee tourists of whom we
          hear so often, and whom we do meet occasionally, -- the
          tourists who "do" Europe in six weeks, -- whose comment
          on Venice is that they do not care much for those old
          towns, and on the Venus de' Medici that they do not like
          them stone gals. If we thought at all about the name on
          the title-page, we should put it down as a pseudonym,
          though the probability is that we should not think about
          it. Anyhow, we should come to the conclusion that Mark
          Twain, whoever he might be, had hit off the oddities of
          some of his countrymen very well; that many of his
          remarks were amusing, and almost witty; and that he was
          certainly not such a fool as he tried to look. But when
          Mr. Hingston tells us seriously that Mark Twain is really
          the pseudonym of the sub-editor of a daily paper in a
          Western city a few months old, that he is a flower of the
          wilderness, a thoroughly untravelled American applying
          the standard of Nevada to historical Europe, we are
          fairly puzzled. We can readily believe that the writer of
          this book is ignorant of many of those things which would
          be familiar to an English tourist. His remark that
          "Raphael, Angelo, Canova -- giants like these gave birth
          to the designs" of the statues on the Cathedral at Milan,
          is not much more than the hasty generalization of one who
          takes his facts from guides and guide-books. The
          statement that "Raphael pictured such infernal villains
          as Catherine de' Medici seated in heaven and conversing
          familiarly with the Virgin Mary and the angels," may
          surprise those who remember that Catherine de' Medici was
          only born one year before the death of Raphael. Again, we
          are told that Raphael is buried in Santa Croce, instead
          of in the Pantheon; but we may conclude from this that in
          Mark Twain's opinion every great artist should be buried
          in several places, just as each relic of a saint is
          multiplied. We owe this suggestion to what Mark Twain
          says of an important fellow-passenger calling himself
          Commissioner of the United States of America to Europe,
          Asia, and Africa. The comment on this "titular avalanche"
          is, "to my thinking, when the United States considered it
          necessary to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the
          ocean, it would be in better taste and safer to take him
          apart and cart him over in sections in several
          ships."</p>

          <p>In all these mistakes there is nothing unnatural. Most
          men who are not learned, and who do not take the
          precaution of using books of reference before they speak,
          may fall into the same errors. The only thing that
          characterizes Mark Twain is the reckless manner in which
          he makes his assertions. The greater his blunder, the
          more assurance there is in his language. Thus he says,
          without the slightest reserve, that the Emperor of the
          French "kept his faithful watch and walked his weary beat
          as a common policeman of London" as if the special
          constable of 1848 had been Z 264. Yet it is not till we
          get beyond the mistakes that we light on the genuine
          untravelled American. It is significant of him that he
          does not commit himself to facts of his own, because he
          is sceptical as to the existence of everything. He
          listens gravely to the guide's stories, and then asks
          some question which reduces them to an absurdity. He
          finds everybody else admiring a picture, and that is
          enough to set him against it. By putting a number of
          exaggerations together he deprives any little grain of
          truth of its value. This is the man who, in the present
          volume, remarks that the Italians spell a word Vinci and
          pronounce it Vinchy, adding calmly, "foreigners always
          spell better than they pronounce." He, too, when shown
          the writing of Christopher Columbus observes, "Why, I
          have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that
          could write better than that. You mustn't think you can
          impose on us because we are strangers. We are not fools
          by a good deal. If you have got any specimens of
          penmanship of real merit, trot them out, and if you
          haven't, drive on!" There are a good many comments on
          pictures from the same point of view. Take this on the
          characters of Sacred Art: "When we see a monk sitting on
          a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human
          skull beside him and without other baggage, we know that
          is St. Jerome; because we know that he always went flying
          light in the matter of baggage. When we see a party
          looking tranquilly up to heaven, unconscious that his
          body is shot through and through with arrows, we know
          that that is St. Sebastian. When we see other monks
          looking tranquilly up to heaven, but <i>having no
          trade-mark,</i> we always ask who those parties are."
          Another question on which the untravelled American is
          worth hearing is the ubiquity of guides, with their
          constant repetition of legends and their unceasing
          exaggeration. At Gibraltar one story was dinned into the
          tourist's ear, till at last he exclaimed to the narrator,
          "Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land; have pity
          on me." One supposed safeguard against invention is that
          a guide "would hardly try so hazardous an experiment as
          the telling of a falsehood when it is all he can do to
          speak the truth in English without getting the lockjaw."
          But even this seems to have failed in Rome, if we may
          judge from the following tirade against the mythical
          being to whom the guides give the name of Michael
          <a name="4">Angelo:</a></p>

          <blockquote>
            In this connection I wish to say one word about Michael
            Angelo Buonarotti. I used to worship the mighty genius
            of Michael Angelo--that man who was great in poetry,
            painting, sculpture, architecture--great in everything
            he undertook. But I do not want Michael Angelo for
            breakfast--for luncheon--for dinner--for tea--for
            supper--for between meals. I like a change,
            occasionally. In Genoa, he designed everything; in
            Milan he or his pupils designed everything; he designed
            the Lake of Como; in Padua, Verona, Venice, Bologna,
            who did we ever hear of, from guides, but Michael
            Angelo? In Florence, he painted everything, designed
            everything, nearly, and what he did not design he used
            to sit on a favorite stone and look at, and they showed
            us the stone. In Pisa he designed everything but the
            old shot-tower, and they would have attributed that to
            him if it had not been so awfully out of the
            perpendicular. He designed the piers of Leghorn and the
            custom-house regulations of Civita Vecchia. But,
            here--here it is frightful. He designed St. Peter's; he
            designed the Pope; he designed the Pantheon, the
            uniform of the Pope's soldiers, the Tiber, the Vatican,
            the Coliseum, the Capitol, the Tarpeian Rock, the
            Barberini Palace, St. John Lateran, the Campagna, the
            Appian Way, the Seven Hills, the Baths of Caracalla,
            the Claudian Aqueduct, the Cloaca Maxima--the eternal
            bore designed the Eternal City, and unless all men and
            books do lie, he painted everything in it! Dan said the
            other day to the guide, "Enough, enough, enough! Say no
            more! Lump the whole thing! say that the Creator made
            Italy from designs by Michael Angelo!"<br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; I never felt so fervently thankful, so
            soothed, so tranquil, so filled with a blessed peace,
            as I did yesterday, when I learned that Michael Angelo
            was dead.

          <p>This last touch is exactly characteristic of the
          untravelled American. In other places, however, the
          exaggeration to which Mark Twain gives way shows that he
          is consciously acting a part. We do not like him any the
          worse for that, and without the preface we should have
          been easily reconciled to his eccentricities. His
          incidental remarks about things in general are
          sufficiently humorous to ensure his book a hearing,
          though they have the misfortune to contradict Mr.
          Hingston's theory. The genuine Yankee tourist would never
          sneer at one of his fellow countrymen for ignorance of
          French manners and assumption of native superiority. When
          Mark Twain finds an American proclaiming his nationality
          in this offensive way -- "I am a freeborn sovereign, Sir,
          an American, Sir, and I want everybody to know it" -- he
          adds, "the fellow did not mention that he was a lineal
          descendant of Balaam's ass, but everybody knew that
          without his telling it." Does this come under the rule of
          <i>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</i> We think not. In our
          opinion Mark Twain is merely showing the prevalence of
          the faults which he satirizes. He wishes to remind us
          that, whether we take Mr. Hingston's view or the more
          natural one, he is not the only untravelled American in
          his party, and that he is always on the look-out for
          incidents which may serve his purpose. In this respect
          Mark Twain's travels remind us of <i>The Book of
          Snobs,</i> where the fancy picture of the author wholly
          eclipsed his characters.</p>
