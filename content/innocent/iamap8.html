        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Odessa</h2><br />

        <p>I have not felt so much at home for a long time as I did
        when I ''raised the hill" and stood in Odessa for the first
        time. It looked just like an American city; fine, broad
        streets, and straight as well; low houses, (two or three
        stories,) wide, neat, and free from any quaintness of
        architectural ornamentation; locust trees bordering the
        sidewalks (they call them acacias;) a stirring,
        business-look about the streets and the stores; fast
        walkers; a familiar <i>new</i> look about the houses and
        every thing; yea, and a driving and smothering cloud of
        dust that was so like a message from our own dear native
        land that we could hardly refrain from shedding a few
        grateful tears and execrations in the old time-honored
        American way. Look up the street or down the street, this
        way or that way, we saw only America! There was not one
        thing to remind us that we were in Russia. We walked for
        some little distance, reveling in this home vision, and
        then we came upon a church and a hack-driver, and presto!
        the illusion vanished! The church had a slender-spired dome
        that rounded inward at its base, and looked like a turnip
        turned upside down, and the hackman seemed to be dressed in
        a long petticoat without any hoops. These things were
        essentially foreign, and so were the carriages--but every
        body knows about these things, and there is no occasion for
        my describing them.</p>

        <p>We were only to stay here a day and a night and take in
        coal; we consulted the guide-books and were rejoiced to
        know that there were no sights in Odessa to see; and so we
        had one good, untrammeled holyday on our hands, with
        nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoy ourselves.
        We sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearful
        and wonderful costumes from the back country; examined the
        populace as far as eyes could do it; and closed the
        entertainment with an ice-cream debauch. We do not get
        ice-cream every where, and so, when we do, we are apt to
        dissipate to excess. We never cared any thing about
        ice-cream at home, but we look upon it with a sort of
        idolatry now that it is so scarce in these red-hot climates
        of the East.</p>
