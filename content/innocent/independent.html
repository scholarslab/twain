          <p>We do not mean to say that Mark Twain is the best of American humorists, for we do not think so, although the list is not very long; and yet he has found publishers in the American Publishing Company (Hartford) for a large octavo volume, entitled "The Innocents Abroad," which gives a very humorous account of his experiences and that of the party which sailed in the "Quaker City" two years ago for a visit to Europe and the Holy Land.  The volume contains many shrewd things, and not a few that are funny; and, although it does not claim to represent the highest type of literary work, it fulfills what it does claim, and gives a much more truthful idea, we doubt not, of life and scenes abroad than many a more pretentious book.  We doubt not it will find many readers.</p>
