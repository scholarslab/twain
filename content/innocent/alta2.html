        <p>We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and
        already the African one, "Ape's Hill," a grand old mountain
        with summit streaked with granite ledges, was in sight. The
        other, the great Rock of Gibraltar, was yet to come. The
        ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the head of
        navigation and the end of the world. The information the
        ancients didn't have, was very voluminous. Think of the
        Children of Israel poking around in the desert forty years
        instead of cutting across; think of Peter trying to walk on
        the water when he had never practiced; think of Joseph
        getting his brothers into his power after they had treated
        him so shabbily and then not hanging them a little. The
        ancients didn't know much. Even the prophets wrote book
        after book and epistle after epistle, yet never once hinted
        at the existence of a great continent on our side of the
        water, yet they must have known it was there, I should
        think. They knew beforehand what was going to happen, and
        surely they ought to have known what already existed. But
        no, they left the ancient public to believe that the
        Pillars of Hercules was the head of navigation, and
        Columbus was the first practical prophet to come out and
        tell them any better.</p>
