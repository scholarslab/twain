  <p><b>M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN'S</font>
  L<font size="-1">ECTURE.</font></b> -- White's Hall was filled
  from cellar to garret, last night, by one of the best tickled
  audiences that ever assembled there to hear a lecture or see the
  speaker. Mark Twain tickled them. And he did it so easily and
  almost consistently, that they didn't know what they were
  laughing at more than half the time. Twain is witty, and his wit
  comes from his own fertile brain. His style is original; and his
  manner of speaking is not after the manner of men generally. His
  serious face and long drawn words are, of themselves, sufficient
  to make one laugh, even if there were not in every sentence
  expressed a sparkling gem of humor, and original idea. His
  anecdotes, with which the lecture is repleat, are rich, and, as
  he tells them, irresistibly funny. In some of his descriptions of
  European places and characters the lecturer delivers, at times,
  most eloquent passages, brilliant in thought and word.</p>

  <p>That M<font size="-1">ARK</font> T<font size="-1">WAIN</font>
  is a success as a lecturer, as well as writer, we think no one
  who heard "The American Vandal Abroad," last night, will
  dispute.</p></td></tr></table>
