        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Venice By Day</h3><br />

        <p>We reached Venice at eight in the evening, and entered a
        hearse belonging to the Grand Hotel d'Europe. At any rate,
        it was more like a hearse than any thing else, though to
        speak by the card, it was a gondola. And this was the
        storied gondola of Venice!--the fairy boat in which the
        princely cavaliers of the olden time were wont to cleave
        the waters of the moonlit canals and look the eloquence of
        love into the soft eyes of patrician beauties, while the
        gay gondolier in silken doublet touched his guitar and sang
        as only gondoliers can sing! This the famed gondola and
        this the gorgeous gondolier!--the one an inky, rusty old
        canoe with a sable hearse-body clapped on to the middle of
        it, and the other a mangy, barefooted guttersnipe with a
        portion of his raiment on exhibition which should have been
        sacred from public scrutiny. Presently, as he turned a
        corner and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two
        long rows of towering, untenanted buildings, the gay
        gondolier began to sing, true to the traditions of his
        race. I stood it a little while. Then I said:</p>

        <p>"Now, here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo, I'm a
        pilgrim, and I'm a stranger, but I am not going to have my
        feelings lacerated by any such caterwauling as that. If
        that goes on, one of us has got to take water. It is enough
        that my cherished dreams of Venice have been blighted
        forever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous
        gondolier; this system of destruction shall go no farther;
        I will accept the hearse, under protest, and you may fly
        your flag of truce in peace, but here I register a dark and
        bloody oath that you shan't sing. Another yelp, and
        overboard you go."</p>
