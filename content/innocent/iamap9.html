        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Smyrna</h2><br />

        <p>This seaport of Smyrna, our first notable acquaintance
        in Asia, is a closely packed city of one hundred and thirty
        thousand inhabitants, and, like Constantinople, it has no
        outskirts. It is as closely packed at its outer edges as it
        is in the centre, and then the habitations leave suddenly
        off and the plain beyond seems houseless. It is just like
        any other Oriental city. That is to say, its Moslem houses
        are heavy and dark, and as comfortless as so many tombs;
        its streets are crooked, rudely and roughly paved, and as
        narrow as an ordinary staircase; the streets uniformly
        carry a man to any other place than the one he wants to go
        to, and surprise him by landing him in the most unexpected
        localities; business is chiefly carried on in great covered
        bazaars, celled like a honeycomb with innumerable shops no
        larger than a common closet, and the whole hive cut up into
        a maze of alleys about wide enough to accommodate a laden
        camel, and well calculated to confuse a stranger and
        eventually lose him; every where there is dirt, every where
        there are fleas, every where there are lean, broken-hearted
        dogs; every alley is thronged with people; wherever you
        look, your eye rests upon a wild masquerade of extravagant
        costumes; the workshops are all open to the streets, and
        the workmen visible; all manner of sounds assail the ear,
        and over them all rings out the muezzin's cry from some
        tall minaret, calling the faithful vagabonds to prayer; and
        superior to the call to prayer, the noises in the streets,
        the interest of the costumes--superior to every thing, and
        claiming the bulk of attention first, last, and all the
        time--is a combination of Mohammedan stenches, to which the
        smell of even a Chinese quarter would be as pleasant as the
        roasting odors of the fatted calf to the nostrils of the
        returning Prodigal. Such is Oriental luxury--such is
        Oriental splendor! We read about it all our days, but we
        comprehend it not until we see it.</p>
