<i>This is a work-in-progress.  Drawn mainly from the resources of the Barrett Collection, it focuses on how "Mark Twain" and his works were created and defined, marketed and performed, reviewed and appreciated.  The goal is to allow readers, scholars, students and teachers to see what Mark Twain and His Times said about each other, in a way that can speak to us today.</i>
