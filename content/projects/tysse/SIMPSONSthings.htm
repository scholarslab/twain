    <p align="left">In &quot;The Simpsons Tall 
    Tales,&quot; Simpsons characters satirize and play on many Twain 
    references, both famous and subtle.&nbsp; The episode is, at best, only loosely based on<i> The 
    Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>.&nbsp; In general, it plays on the kind of language Twain employed and 
    the well-known characters that he used, like Tom, Huck, Becky, and Judge 
    Thatcher.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left"><i><b>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4" color="#008080">Twain's Tall Tale</font></b></i></p>
    <p align="left">Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the entire Simpsons 
    take on Twain comes during the intro to the actual sketch.&nbsp; The Simpsons characters listen to an old 
    hobo tell American Tall Tales.&nbsp; 
    After telling the Paul Bunyan and Johnny Appleseed tales, the hobo sees the 
    Mississippi River, and says, &quot;Reminds me of a tall tale about two scallywags 
    rafting down the big muddy--Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.&quot;&nbsp; Lisa protests, 
    saying &quot;That's not a tall tale; it's a book, by Mark Twain.&quot;&nbsp; The hobo 
    responds: &quot;Look, let's just do this thing.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">On one level, this is just another silly Simpsons joke--the 
    hobo doesn't know that Tom and Huck were the product of an author.&nbsp; On quite another 
    level, though, it reveals how deeply Tom, Huck, and Mark Twain have 
    become engrained in the American cultural consciousness, as icons of 
    American literary history.&nbsp; The hobo can't distinguish Twain's stories 
    from some incredibly famous tall tales, and by inclusion in the &quot;Tall Tales&quot; 
    episode of the Simpsons, neither can the writers.&nbsp; Tom and Huck have 
    become American icons in the same vein as Paul Bunyan and Johnny Appleseed..&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <p align="left">
    Part of the reason the Simpsons' writers chose to do a story based 
    on Tom and Huck must have had something to do with how well Bart's character 
    matched  with Tom's.&nbsp; Tom Sawyer was the bad boy of the 
    1840s--constantly getting into mischief, driving his parental figures wild, 
    and possessing a real penchant for productions and performance.&nbsp; Much 
    of the same can be said of the bad boy of the early 1990s--Bart Simpson.&nbsp; 
    Bart slides easily into this role, as an icon of American boyhood from a 
    different era.&nbsp; He also constantly is showing off, play-acting, and 
    getting into trouble, but like Tom Sawyer, deep down he has a heart of gold.&nbsp; What kinds of similarities do the two possess, 
    specifically?&nbsp;  </p>
    <p align="left">
    Nelson as Huck Finn is a more interesting comparison.&nbsp; On the show, 
    Nelson plays a big bully, and is nowhere near as friendly and human as Huck 
    Finn.&nbsp; However, there are certain similarities--they both fit a certain 
    &quot;poor-white&quot; stereotype, Nelson's and Huck's parents are both either dead or 
    absent for most of their lives, and Nelson and Huck both manage to have 
    interesting and dangerous adventures.&nbsp; How well do you think Nelson 
    fits the Huck Finn stereotype?</p>

    <img border="0" src="images/whitewash.jpg" width="240" height="159" align="left"></font></b></i>One 
    of the best-known and best-loved moments in <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
    </i>is the whitewashing scene, where the wily Tom convinces half the 
    neighborhood children to not only do his chore of painting for him, but to 
    actually pay him for the privilege.&nbsp; By making the odious task <i>seem
    </i>desirable to the neighborhood kids, Tom shows his smarts, gets out of 
    his chores, and becomes richer in the process.&nbsp;
    <img border="0" src="images/Twa2Tom32.gif" align="right" width="223" height="204"></p>
    <p align="left">&quot;The Simpsons'&quot; take on the whitewashing scene is quite 
    different, of course.&nbsp; Now Tom and Huck are whitewashing the fence 
    together (Huck: &quot;Whitewashing sucks, Tom.&nbsp; It powerful sucks&quot;).&nbsp; 
    And this time, instead of Tom's finagling and finesse, Huck, as Nelson the bully, simply slams the neighborhood childrens' heads into the paint, 
    and then yells at them to &quot;Get to work!&quot; </p>

    <p align="left">Another famous scene from <i>Tom Sawyer </i>is when Tom 
    first falls in love with Becky Thatcher, and shows off in front of her house 
    for several hours, in hopes that she'll catch a glimpse and reciprocate his 
    affections.&nbsp; In &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; the episode is replayed, only now it is with 
    Huck instead of Tom.&nbsp; This makes sense on a certain technical level, because Becky is played by 
    Lisa, Bart (Tom's) sister--it wouldn't do to have the Simpsons siblings fall in love.&nbsp; 
     
    </p>
    <p align="left">After showing off on top of the fence, Becky tells him to be careful, lest 
    he break his neck.&nbsp; Huck replies: &quot;I'll just get a new neck... off'n a 
    cat,&quot; a reference to the dead cat which Huck uses in superstitious rites in
    <i>Tom Sawyer.&nbsp; </i>When Huck falls off the fence, Becky comes to his rescue, 
    and they both fall in love.&nbsp; Caught holding hands by Judge Thatcher (a 
    hilariously miscast Homer Simpson), they are forced to have a shotgun 
    wedding.</p>

    <p align="left">Perhaps the rafting trip is the most striking aspect of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode's take 
    on Huck and Tom's adventures.&nbsp; 
    In <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, </i>the river and the raft are the 
    main literal and metaphorical vehicles of the text, the engine through which 
    the runaway slave Jim both escapes slavery and finds his humanity.&nbsp; The 
    journey down the river in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is in general a more 
    serious and artistic enterprise than much of the rest of Twain's fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, Jim is completely absent.&nbsp; 
    While this is not particularly egregious in a show that is meant to be 
    funny, it is interesting that the writers would choose to eliminate the most 
    crucial character, besides Huck, in&nbsp;all of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, 
    and reduce the raft to a mere set piece.&nbsp; The raft is still used to aid 
    runaways, but now their crimes are &quot;Marriage-dodging&quot; and &quot;Moonshining&quot; (the 
    exposing of Bart's bare bottom, not the making of bathtub liquor) rather 
    than escaping slavery or aiding a runaway slave.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left"><i><b>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4" color="#008080">
    <img border="0" src="images/old%20man%20river.jpg" align="left" width="315" height="211"></font></b></i>There 
    is, it turns out, a steamboat on this rafting trip as well, but instead of 
    being an old wreck, dangled precariously on rocks, it is a grand, decadent 
    steamboat, with gambling tables and a bar.&nbsp; The use of the steamboat 
    recalls Twain's own adventures and familiar relationship with steamboating, 
    as he was a steamboat pilot for 4 years.&nbsp; Interestingly, too, the first 
    character Tom and Huck meet on the steamboat is Doctor Hibbert, dressed as 
    the riverboat captain, and singing &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; from the musical 
    &quot;Showboat.&quot;&nbsp; Since Dr. Hibbert is black, and this song is sung by a 
    black character, it is interesting that the creators chose to confront race 
    in this way rather than by including Jim.</p>

    <p align="left">In the episode, Tom and Huck do something they never did 
    either <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer </i>or <i>Adventures of Huckleberry 
    Finn--</i>they get aboard a working steamboat.&nbsp; Unfortunately, their 
    adventure is short lived, as they are quickly kicked off for causing 
    disturbances.&nbsp; On the way off the boat, the bartender Moe tells the 
    boys to &quot;Light out, and <i>stay </i>lit out!&quot;&nbsp; This, of course, is a 
    cute reference to a phrase Huck uses occasionally, but most notably in the 
    final line of <i>Huckleberry Finn: &quot;</i>But I reckon I got to light out for 
    the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me 
    and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

    <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, </i>Huck, Tom and their friend Joe Harper 
    spend a few nights on Jackson's Island, a secluded spot a few miles from St. 
    Petersburg.&nbsp; Since the boys didn't give notice of where they were 
    going, their families panicked, convinced themselves the boys had drowned, 
    and held a funeral for them the following Sunday.&nbsp; Tom, overhearing the 
    plan for the funeral, convinces the boys to wait a few days and then march 
    in on their own funerals.&nbsp; Twain describes the scene in chapter 17 of
    <i>Tom Sawyer</i>: </p>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 25">There was a rustle in the gallery, 
    which nobody noticed; a moment later the church door creaked; the minister 
    raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! 
    First one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister's, and then 
    almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three 
    dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a 
    ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in 
    the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!</p>
    <p align="left">This Simpsons episode plays on the familiar story, but 
    with a very twisted result.&nbsp; The boys spend most of the episode running 
    from Judge Thatcher and his cronies, who are in hot pursuit.&nbsp; They are 
    eventually apprehended at the end of the episode.&nbsp; The next cut is to 
    the church, with a sign outside reading &quot;Sawyer-Finn Funeral.&quot;&nbsp; Inside 
    the church, the pastor is saying a few remarks about the boys, and there are 
    two matching small coffins in front of him.&nbsp; The next scene, however, 
    is a surprise--the boys are both on the rafters above, watching their own 
    funerals and listening to the 
    pastor give their funeral sermon, just like in the book: </p>
    <p align="center"><i><b>

    <img border="0" src="images/watching%20the%20funeral.jpg" width="266" height="183"></font></b></i></p>
    <p align="left">However, the pastor immediately after intones, &quot;Now for the 
    traditional lowering of the bodies into the caskets.&quot;&nbsp; It turns out 
    that the boys were caught after all, in a funny, if somewhat macabre, 
    send-up of Twain.&nbsp; This seems a parody of both the scene in <i>Tom 
    Sawyer, </i>and of Twain's tendency to miraculously get Tom Sawyer out of 
    whatever scrape he's in:</p>
