    <font face="Times New Roman">When <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn </i>was 
    first published in 1885, the Concord Library Committee determined that it 
    was &quot;the veriest trash,&quot; and banned the book from its shelves.&nbsp; 
    Similarly, when &quot;The Simpsons&quot; first debuted in 1989, Robert Thompson, 
    director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse 
    University, recalls that the show was at first &quot;incredibly shocking: The PTA 
    was up in arms, parents couldn't believe it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Thompson 
    now feels that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is &quot;quaint&quot; by comparison to other television 
    shows, he argues that it &quot;the greatest comedy in the history of television.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Most importantly: &quot;I would put this in an American comedy hall of fame along 
    with Mark Twain.&quot;</font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps it's no surprise, as Matt Groening cited Mark Twain as one of his 
    early influences in a
    <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodeguide/season1.html">1993 interview</a>. 
    Certainly, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and Twain both had great success in satirizing a 
    wide number of targets.&nbsp; And they are each 
    among the most 
    popular and best loved humor and satire sources of their 
    day.&nbsp; It was only a matter of time before the creators of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;–who never run out of targets to lampoon–would insert Mark Twain's 
    stories into their funny world,  creating a 
    marriage of two comedic legends.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, for their 12th-season finale, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; chose to 
    portray three American tales.&nbsp; Their third tale had to do with the 
    Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.&nbsp; The familiar Simpsons 
    characters are transplanted into 1840s Missouri, where familiar but 
    deliberately twisted events occur.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
