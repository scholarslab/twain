    <p align="left">In &quot;Time's Arrow,&quot; Parts I and II, Samuel Clemens, aka Mark
    Twain, bumps into the crew of the USS Enterprise in late-nineteenth century
    San Francisco.&nbsp; While the episode doesn't  have much to do with
    any of Twain's novels, it is very instructive in seeing the kind of
    viewpoints and images associated with Mark Twain today.</p>
    <p align="left"><i><b>
    <font size="4" face="Bookman Old Style" color="#008080">Twain's Image</font></b></i></p>
    <p align="left">The first and most important aspects of Twain's presentation
    in Star Trek is his image and where the writers chose to place Twain.&nbsp;
    Twain is depicted, as he invariably is today, as a crotchety old cigar-smoker in a white suit.&nbsp; His place of residence in 1893 is San
    Francisco, according to the episodes.&nbsp; But these are both
    anachronistic.&nbsp; Twain didn't start wearing the white suit until
    December, 1906, but he is invariably wearing the suit when depicted today.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    <img border="1" src="images/STtwaincigar.jpg" width="195" height="149" align="left" hspace="8">Second,
    Twain lived in Hartford, CT and abroad for most of his later years, leaving
    San Francisco and the West behind him at a relatively young age.&nbsp; Twain
    would not have been living in or visiting San Francisco during this time
    period.&nbsp; As Valerie Fulton points out in her
    <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/pmc/text-only/issue.594/fulton-v.594">essay</a>, &quot;An Other Frontier:
    Voyaging West With Mark Twain and Star Trek's Imperial Subject&quot;: &quot;Despite
    the fact that Clemens left San Franscisco in 1866, at the age of thirty-one,
    the show depicts him in the guise of the white-haired, white-suited
    curmudgeon whom Americans readily recognize--in large part because a
    white-haired, white-suited automaton 'Mark Twain' greets millions of
    visitors each year to Disney's Frontierland.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">
    However, Twain does have the unique position of occupying several
    home spheres.&nbsp; If you look at a
    <a target="_self" href="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/sc_as_mt/funrobit.html">
    sampling</a> of Clemens obituaries from around the country, papers from the
    West and East both claim him as their own--the only papers that as a rule do
    not are the Southern papers--somewhat ironically,  for he was born in
    Hannibal, MO.&nbsp; It seems that the Star Trek portrays him not accurately
    but entirely in keeping with Modern America's conception of Twain.&nbsp; The
    Star Trek creators did get his cigar smoking right, though--Twain was
    certainly fond of <a href="images/STmarktwaincigarvideo.WMV">cigars</a>.</p>

    <font color="#008080" size="4" face="Bookman Old Style">Halley's Comet</font></b></i></p>
    <p align="left">Clemens died on the 22nd of April, 1910.&nbsp; Halley's
    comet was visible to the naked eye that night, for the first time in about
    75 years.&nbsp; In a truly remarkable coincidence, it was also visible to
    the naked eye on November 30, 1835--the date of Clemens birth.&nbsp; Clemens
    had this to say of Halley's comet: &quot;I came in 1835 with Halley's Comet . . .
    and I expect to go out with it. It'll be the great disappointment of my life
    if I don't. The Almighty has said, no doubt, 'Now here are two indefinable
    freaks. They came in together. They must go out together.' Oh, I am looking
    forward to that.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">The Star Trek writers pay homage to this  coincidence,
    when, late in the episode, they have Twain facetiously ask about the comet:
    &quot;So, this is a space-ship...did you ever run into Halley's comet?&nbsp;
    Ha-hah!&quot; </p>

    <p align="left"><b><i>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4" color="#008080">Gadgets</font></i></b></p>
    <p align="left">
    The
    creators of Time's Arrow Part 1 and 2 portray a Mark Twain who is entirely
    suspicious of new gadgets and inventions.&nbsp; He
    <a href="images/yankee1.WMV">talks</a> about how his Connecticut Yankee
    ruined the past with his new-fangled inventions; he is entirely suspicious
    of the machine Data created (and even steals a piece from it), and discusses
    several times that he fears the inventions of the future.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">
    <img border="0" src="images/STtwaingadget.jpg" align="left" width="213" height="159">However, there is good evidence that Twain was
    actually very
    fascinated with gadgets, and even went bankrupt because of too-great
    a speculative interest in a new type of printing press.&nbsp; Fulton
    references John Lauber, &quot;[who] notes in the preface to his biography of the
    writer, he was even &quot;an inventor in a small way, patenting a self-pasting
    scrapbook and a self-adjusting vest strap, copyrighting a game to teach
    historical facts, even imagining microprint.&quot; </p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008080" size="4" face="Bookman Old Style"><i>
    <b>Imperialism</b></i></font></p>
    <p align="left">By the end of Samuel Clemens' life, he wrote several pieces
    that were harshly critical of imperialism, most notably, &quot;To a Stranger
    Sitting in Darkness&quot; and &quot;The War Prayer,&quot; as well as a number of editorials
    and anti-imperialism essays.&nbsp; He held very anti-imperialist views
    against Spain during the Spanish-American war, and subsequently attacked
    America for not liberating the Philippines once the territory was given to
    the US following the Treaty of Paris, during Spanish-American peace accords.&nbsp;
    He championed deposed Philippine leader Emilio Aquinaldo as akin to great
    men like George Washington, fighting as rebels against colonial occupation.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">In these episodes of Star Trek, the writers have interpreted
    Twain's views as such.&nbsp; Twain first appears as extremely suspicious and
    is a constant meddler.&nbsp; He overhears Data and Guinan's conversation
    about how Data has arrived from the future.&nbsp; Fearing new-fangled
    gadgetry and imperial colonization, Twain begins to try his best to sabotage
    Data's plans, including stealing a piece from a bit of machinery Data
    invented, threatening Star Trek crew members with a gun, and even slipping
    onto the USS Enterprise instead of Captain Picard.&nbsp; He
    <a href="images/yankee1.WMV">speaks</a> of how he had written a book, <i>A
    Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, </i>that was about a time
    traveler who messed up the past with his inventions and meddling.&nbsp; As
    Fulton points out,</p>
    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 25">This frankly anti-imperialist gloss
    of <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> typifies Clemens's
    initial <a href="images/STimperialismvideo.WMV">response</a> to the
    Federation, whose motives he compares to those of the Spanish, Dutch, and
    Portugese.&nbsp; Skeptical about whether the U.S.S. Enterprise can really be
    a &quot;ship of peace,&quot; the writer objects that this is &quot;what all conquerors
    say.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">But an anti-imperialist gloss of <i>Yankee </i>is hardly the
    only interpretation.&nbsp; Again, Fulton references Werner Sollors, who
    &quot;points out [that] the novel is not easily reduced to a clear or stable
    interpretation; it has been &quot;embattled by interpreters&quot; who question whether
    it constitutes &quot;light and humorous praise of worthy progress&quot; or is instead
    &quot;a bitter and gloomy anticipation of the century of nuclear holocausts and
    mass genocides.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">The Star Trek crew members eventually convince Twain that
    the future is actually a very positive place, and that they are not evil
    imperialists.&nbsp; Twain, surprisingly, seems quite
    <a href="images/STmaybe%20its%20worth%20giving%20up%20cigars.WMV">convinced</a> by the end of the second
    episode--he <a href="images/SThappyending.WMV">thanks</a> Data as he leaves,
    thanking him for &quot;helping a bitter old man&quot; find out that the future &quot;turned
    out pretty well, after all.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">The question becomes: do these episodes of Star Trek
    oversimplify and create a happy ending?&nbsp; To a certain extent they have
    to, do to constraints of portraying a complex character in a TV episode
    format.&nbsp; View the clips below and decide for yourself:</p>

    <div align="left">
      <p align="left">Any good student of Mark Twain knows the kind of dual-life
      he led as both Samuel Clemens and Mark Twain, and that Mark Twain is very
      much a public persona, created by Samuel Clemens for purposes of his own.&nbsp;
      So it is somewhat surprising when, at the end of the Episode, Clemens
      <a href="images/STwhatiam.wmv">tells</a> Picard that in order to know him
      better, he ought to read his books--for &quot;What I am is pretty much there.&quot;&nbsp;
      Certainly there are ways that Clemens the person and Twain the character
      differ.&nbsp; Is this too-great of a simplification?</div>
