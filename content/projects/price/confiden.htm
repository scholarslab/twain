"It is good to be shifty in a new country" is the credo of the foremost literary example of a
confidence man, Captain Simon Suggs of Tallapoosa.  The confidence man appears throughout
Southwestern humor -- as gambler, doctor, horse trader -- any occupation which he can mimic
and convert for his own benefit.  The confidence man is a performer in every sense of
the word and takes full advantage of a pose of naivete.  The confidence man is created during a
time in history when the individuals of American society are suffering from identity crises.
<i>Who one is </I> is no longer dependent upon a family name or birthplace.  Particularly in the
frontier community, people settle near one another with varied backgrounds and must develop different methods of
proving themselves important in their society.  From this attempt comes much of the bravado, hyperbole and
violence of the southwestern humor sketches -- full of men attempting to validate themselves as
important, strong or talented to the world around them.
<p>
<a href="ahooper.htm">Johnson Jones Hooper</a> invents a character of some complexity to
which the reader feels an oddly disinterested attraction.  Suggs is deplorable, coniving and a
swindler.  Yet Suggs' acknowledgement and acceptance of his own depravity lends a sort of
honesty to his characterization that connotes a peculiar sense of respectibility.
Suggs is representative of everyman's search for identity as he  tries on various roles within his
society.
 <p>
Hooper describes in great detail this charlatan who can emerge a low-class derelict desiring to
repent of his sin or convince others of his high position in society as a town doctor. Suggs'
<p>
<blockquote><tt>...head is somewhat large, and thinly covered with coarse, silver-white hair, a
single lock of which lies close and smooth down the middle of a forehead which is thus divided
into a couple of very acute triangles, the base of each of which is an eye-brow, lightly
defined...Beneath...a pair of eyes with light-grey pupils and variegated whites...lids without
lashes complete the optical apparatus...The nose...is long and low, with an extremity of singular
acuteness, overhanging the subjacent mouth... [which]measures about four inches horizontally.
An ever present sneer--not all malice, however--draws down the corners, from which radiate
many small wrinkles that always testify to the Captain's love of the 'filthy weed'.</blockquote>

<p>Not only using Suggs as a confidence man, Hooper, (like all the Southwest humorists),
hoped to use his writings to promote his own political ideas -- those of the Southern Whig party.
The description of Suggs achieved an undeniable comparison to Andrew Jackson in the minds of
readers in the 1840's.  In the first chapter, Hooper writes, "...future generations of naughty
children who will persist in sitting up when they should be a-bed, will be frightened to their cribs
by the lithograph of 'Major General Andrew Jackson,' which their mammas will declare to be a
faithful representation of the Evil One--an atrocious and comparatively well-favoured, prince of
the infernal world."

<i>Some Adventures of Simon Suggs</i> is Hooper's book of Simon Suggs stories; published
in 1845.  The book is set up as a campaign biography and takes the reader from childhood to
middle age in the humorous -- yet always corrupt -- life of Simon Suggs.  Often associated with
his role as the reformed sinner in <A
HREF="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/huckfinn/suggs.html">"The Captain Attends a
Camp-Meeting"</A>, Suggs is a notoriously insincere man.  Many years later, Mark Twain was
to base his chapter "The King Turns Parson" in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> on
Hooper's humorous revival sketch of Suggs.  Like Twain, Hooper is using this sketch to parody
religious zealots.  However, Hooper is also mocking Democratic political rallies in his story.
