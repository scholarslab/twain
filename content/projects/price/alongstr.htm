<b>
The first of the Southwestern humorists, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, was born September 22,
1790 in Augusta, Georgia.  Possibly the most accomplished and well-educted of the humorists,
Longstreet led a varied and illustrious life.  He attended the prestigious Waddell School in
Willinton, South Carolina and then entered Yale College.  He was a lawyer and served
politically on the State Assembly in Georgia and as an elected judge in 1821-1822.   After the
death of his son in 1824 (one of six children to die as an infant) Longstreet withdrew from
political office.

In 1830 he began writing sketches that would be collected into the classic text of Southwestern
humor, <i>Georgia Scenes</i>, published in 1835.  These nineteen stories appeared first as
separate publications in the Milledgeville, Georgia <i>Southern Recorder</i> and in the
Augusta <i>States Rights Sentinel</i>-- of which Longstreet was the editor.  His stories held an
appeal for all--ranging from a didactic, authoritative tone in "The Charming Creature as a Wife"
to the raucous and crude humor of <A

<A HREF="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/fight.html">"The Fight"</A>.  It is in his most
famous story, "The Fight", that Southwestern humor acquires the character type of the <A
HREF="roarer.htm">ring-tailed roarer</A> with Ransy Sniffle.  Sniffle is the first of the frontier
troublemakers and will serve as a model for literary characters even into the twentieth-century
with Faulkner's Flem Snopes.
<p>
In 1838, Longstreet became a Methodist minister and often appeared to regret the brusqueness of
his earlier writing.  Before his death in 1870, Longstreet served as the president of Emory
College, Centenary College, Mississippi State University and South Carolina State University.
He remained active in Confederate concerns, such as states' rights and the secession movement,
writing a book entitled <i>A Voice From the South</i> in 1847.  Despite his impressive career--
spanning education, religion and politics-- Longstreet is best remembered for his contribution to
the creation of the genre of Southwestern humor.
