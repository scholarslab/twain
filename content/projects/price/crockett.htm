<center><h2>Bear Hunting in Tennessee</h2></center>
<p>
    
    But the reader, I expect, would have no objection to know a little
    about my employment during the two years while my competitor
    was in Congress. In this space I had some pretty tuff times, and will
    relate some few things that happened to me. So here goes, as the boy
    said when he run by himself.
    <p>
    In the fall of 1825, I concluded I would build two large boats, and
    load them with pipe staves for market. So I went down to the lake,
    which was about twenty-five miles from where I lived, and hired some
    hands to assist me, and went to work; some at boat building, and
    others to getting staves. I worked on with my hands till the bears got
    fat, and then I turned out to hunting, to lay in a supply of meat. I
    soon killed and salted down as many as were necessary for my family;
    but about this time one of my old neighbours, who had settled down
    on the lake about twenty-five miles from me, came to my house and
    told me he wanted me to go down and kill some bears about in his
    parts. He said they were extremely fat, and very plenty. I know'd
    that when they were fat, they were easily taken, for a fat bear can't
    run fast or long. But I asked a bear no favours, no way, further than
    civility, for I now had eight large dogs, and as fierce as painters; so
    that a bear stood no chance at all to get away from them. So I went
    home with him, and then went on down towards the Mississippi, and
    commenced hunting.
    <p>
    We were out two weeks, and in that time killed fifteen bears.
    Having now supplied my friend with plenty of meat, I engaged 
    occasionally again with my hands in our boat building and getting
    staves. But I at length couldn't stand it any longer without another
    hunt. So I concluded to take my little son, and cross over the lake,
    and take a hunt there. We got over, and that evening turned out and
    killed three bears, in little or no time. The next morning we drove
    up four forks, and made a sort of scaffold, on which we salted up our
    meat, so as to have it out of the reach of the wolves, for as soon
    as we would leave our camp, they would take possession. We had
    just eat our breakfast, when a company of hunters came to our camp,
    who had fourteen dogs, but all so poor, that when they would bark
    they would almost have to lean up against a tree and take a rest. I
    told them their dogs couldn't run in smell of a bear, and they had
    better stay at my camp, and feed them on the bones I had cut out
    of my meat. I left them there, and cut out; but I hadn't gone far,
    when my dogs took a first-rate start after a very large fat old he-bear,
    which run right plump towards my camp. I pursued on, but my 
    other hunters had heard my dogs coming, and met them, and killed 
    the bear before I got up with him. I gave him to them, and cut out
    again for a creek called Big Clover, which wa'n't very far off. Just
    as I got there, and was entering a cane brake, my dogs all broke and
    went ahead, and, in a little time, they raised a fuss in the cane, and  
    seemed to be going every way. I listened a while, and found my dogs
    was in two companies, and that both was in a snorting fight. I sent
    my little son to one, and I broke for ttother. I got to mine first, and    
    found my dogs had a two-year-old bear down, a-wooling away on him;  
    so I just took out my big butcher, and went up and slap'd it into    
    him, and killed him without shooting. There was five of the dogs in  
    my company. In a short time, I heard my little son fire at his bear; 
    when I went to him he had killed it too. He had two dogs in his 
    team. Just at this moment we heard my other dog barking a short  
    distance off, and all the rest immediately broke to him. We pushed   
    on too, and when we got there, we found he had still a larger bear
    than either of them we had killed, treed by himself. We killed that  
    one also, which made three we had killed in less than half an hour.
    We turned in and butchered them, and then started to hunt for water, 
    and a good place to camp. But we had no sooner started, than our
    dogs took a start after another one, and away they went like a thunder-   
    gust, and was out of hearing in a minute. We followed the way they    
    had gone for some time, but at length we gave up the hope of finding  
    them, and turned back. As we were going back, I came to where a  
    poor fellow was grubbing, and he looked like the very picture of
    hard times. I asked him what he was doing away there in the woods
    by himself? He said he was grubbing for a man who intended to
    settle there; and the reason why he did it was, that he had no meat
    for his family, and he was working for a little.
   <p> 
    I was mighty sorry for the poor fellow, for it was not only a hard,
    but a very slow way to get meat for a hungry family; so I told him if he
    would go with me, I would give him more meat than he could get by
    grubbing in a month. I intended to supply him with meat, and also
    to get him to assist my little boy in packing in and salting up my
    bears. He had never seen a bear killed in his life. I told him I had
    six killed then, and my dogs were hard after another. He went off
    to his little cabin, which was a short distance in the brush, and his
    wife was very anxious he should go with me. So we started and went
    to where I had left my three bears, and made a camp. We then
    gathered my meat and salted, and scuffled it, as I had done the other.
    Night now came on, but no word from my dogs yet. I afterwards
    found they had treed the bear about five miles off, near to a man's
    house, and had barked at it the whole enduring night. Poor fellows!
    many a time they looked for me, and wondered why I didn't come,
    for they knowed there was no mistake in me, and I know i they
    were as good as ever fluttered. In the morning, as soon as it was
    light enough to see, the man took his gun and went to them, and
    shot the bear, and killed it. My dogs, however, wouldn't have anything
    to say to this stranger; so they left him, and came early in the morning
    back to me.
    <p>
    We got our breakfast, and cut out again; and we killed four large
    and very fat bears that day. We hunted out the week, and in that
    time we killed seventeen, all of them first-rate. When we closed our
    hunt, I gave the man over a thousand weight of fine fat bear-meat,
    which pleased him mightily, and made him feel as rich as a Jew. I
    saw him the next fall, and he told me he had plenty of meat to do
    him the whole year from his week's hunt. My son and me now went
    home. This was the week between Christmas and New-year that
    we made this hunt.
    <p>
    When I got home, one of my neighbours was out of meat, and
    wanted me to go back, and let him go with me, to take another
    hunt. I couldn't refuse; but I told him I was afraid the bear had
    taken to house by that time, for after they get very fat in the fall
    and early part of the winter, they go into their holes, in large hollow
    trees, or into hollow logs, or their cane-houses, or the hurricanes;
    and lie there till spring, like frozen snakes. And one thing about
    this will seem mighty strange to many people. From about the first
    of January to about the last of April, these varments lie in their holes
    altogether. In all that time they have no food to eat; and yet when
    they come out, they are not an ounce lighter than when they went
    to house. I don't know the cause of this, and still I know it is a fact;
    and I leave it for others who have more learning than myself to
    account for it. They have not a particle of food with them, but they
    just lie and suck the bottom of their paw all the time. I have killed
    many of them in their trees, which enables me to speak positively
    on this subject. However, my neighbour, whose name was McDaniel,
    and my little son and me, went on down to the lake to my second
    camp, where I had killed my seventeen bears the week before, and
    turned out to hunting. But we hunted hard all day without getting
    a single start. We had carried but little provisions with us, and the
    next morning was entirely out of meat. I sent my son about three
    miles off, to the house of an old friend, to get some. The old gentle-
    man was much pleased to hear I was hunting in those parts, for the
    year before the bears had killed a great many of his hags. He was
    that day killing his bacon hogs, and so he gave my son some meat,
    and sent word to me that I must come in to his house that evening
    that he would have plenty of feed for my dogs, and some accommoda-
    tions for ourselves; but before my son got back, we had gone out
    hunting, and in a large cane brake my dogs found a big bear in a
    cane-house, which he had fixed for his winter-quarters, as they some.
    times do.
    <p>
    When my lead dog found him, and raised the yell, all the rest broke
    to him, but none of them entered his house until we got up. I 
    encouraged my dogs, and they knowed me so well, that I could have
    made them seize the old serpent himself, with all his horns and heads,
    and cloven foot and ugliness into the bargain, if he would only have
    come to light, so that they could have seen him. They bulged in, and
    in an instant the bear followed them out, and I told my friend to
    shoot him, as he was mighty wrathy to kill a bear. He did so, and
    killed him prime. We carried him to our camp, by which time my
    son had returned; and after we got our dinners we packed up, and
    cut for the house of my old friend, whose name was Davidson.
    <p>
    We got there, and staid with him that night; and the next morning
    having salted up our meat, we left it with him, and started to take
    a hunt between the Obion lake and the Red-foot lake; as there had
    been a dreadful hurricane, which passed between them, and I was sure
    there must be a heap of bears in the fallen timber. We had gone
    about five miles without seeing any sign at all; but at length we got on
    some high cony ridges, and, as we rode along, I saw a hole in a large
    black oak, and on examining more closely, I discovered that a bear
    had clomb the tree. I could see his tracks going up, but none coming
    down, and so I was sure he was in there. A person who is acquainted
    with bear-hunting, can tell easy enough when the varment is in the
    hollow; for as they go up they don't slip a bit, but as they come down
    they make long scratches with their nails.
    <p>
    My friend was a little ahead of me, but I called him back, and
    told him there was a bear in that tree, and I must have him out. So
    we lit from our horses, and I found a small tree which I thought I
    could fall so as to lodge against my bear tree, and we fell to work
    chopping it with our tomahawks. I intended, when we lodged the
    tree against the other, to let my little son go up, and look into the
    hole, for he could climb like a squirrel. We had chop'd on a little
    time and stop'd to rest, when I heard my dogs barking mighty severe
    at some distance from us, and I told my friend I knowed they had
    a bear, for it is the nature of a dog, when he finds you are hunting
    bears, to hunt for nothing else; he becomes fond of the meat, and
    considers other game as "not worth a notice," as old Johnson said
    of the devil.
    <p>
    We concluded to leave our tree a bit, and went to my dogs, and
    when we got there, sure enough they had an eternal great big fat bear
    up a tree, just ready for shooting. My friend again petitioned me for
    liberty to shoot this one also. I had a little rather not, as the bear was
    so big, but I couldn't refuse; and so he blazed away, and down came
    the old fellow like some great log had fell. I now missed one of my
    dogs, the same that I before spoke of as having treed the bear by
    himself sometime before, when I had started the three in the cane
    break. I told my friend that my missing dog had a bear somewhere,
    just as sure as fate; so I left them to butcher the one we had just
    killed, and I went up on a piece of high ground to listen for my dog.
    I heard him barking with all his might some distance off, and I pushed
    ahead for him. My other dogs hearing him broke to him, and when
    I got there, sure enough again he had another bear ready treed; if
    he hadn't, I wish I may be shot. I fired on him, and brought him
    down; and then went back, and help'd finish butchering the one at
    which I had left my friend. We then packed both to our tree where
    we had left my boy. By this time, the little fellow had cut the tree
    down that we intended to lodge, but it fell the wrong way; he had
    then feather'd in on the big tree, to cut that, and had found that it was
    nothing but a shell on the outside, and all doted in the middle, as too
    many of our big men are in these days, having only an outside
    appearance. My friend and my son cut away on it, and I went off
    about a hundred yards with my dogs to keep them from running
    under the tree when it should fall. On looking back at the hole, I
    saw the bear's head out of it, looking down at them as they were
    cutting. I hollered to them to look up, and they did so; and McDaniel
    catched up his gun, but by this time the bear was out, and coming
    down the tree. He fired at it, and as soon as it touch'd ground the
    dogs were all round it, and they had a roll-and-tumble fight to the fact
    of the hill, where they stop'd him. I ran up, and putting my gun
    against the bear, fired and killed him. We now had three, and so we
    made our scaffold and salted them up.
    <p>
    In the morning I left my son at the camp, and we started on towards
    The harricane; and when we had went about a mile, we started a very
    large bear, but we got along mighty slow on account of the cracks in
    the earth occasioned by the earthquakes. We, however, made out to
    keep in hearing of the dogs for about three miles, and then we came
    to the harricane. Here we had to quit our horses, as old Nick himself
    couldn't have got through it without sneaking it along in the form
    that he put on, to make a fool of our old grandmother Eve. By
    this time several of my dogs had got tired and come back; but we
    went ahead on fact for some little time in the hurricane, when we
    met a bear coming straight to us, and not more than twenty or thirty
    yards off. I started my tired dogs after him, and McDaniel pursued
    them, and I went on to where my other dogs were. I had seen the
    track of the bear they were after, and I knowed he was a screamer. I
    followed on to about the middle of the harricane; but my dogs pursued
    him so close, that they made him climb an old stump about twenty
    feet high. I got in shooting distance of him and fired, but I was all
    over in such a flutter from fatigue and running, that I couldn't hold
    steady; but, however, I broke his shoulder, and he fell. I run up
    and loaded my gun as quick as possible, and shot him again and
    killed him. When I went to take out my knife to butcher him, I
    I found I had lost it in coming through the harricane. The vines and
    briars was so thick that I would sometimes have to get down and
    crawl like a varment to get through at all; and a vine had, as I sup-
    posed, caught in the handle and pulled it out. While I was standing
    and studying what to do my friend came to me. He had followed
    my trail through the harricane, and had found my knife, which was
    mighty good news to me; as a hunter hates the worst in the world to
    lose a good dog, or any part of his hunting-tools. I now left McDaniel
    to butcher the bear, and I went after our horses, and brought them as
    near as the nature of case would allow. I then took our bags, and
    went back to where he was; and when we had skin'd the bear, we
    fleeced off the fat and carried it to our horses at several loads. We
    then packed it up on our horses, and had a heavy pack of it on
    each one. We now started and went on till about sunset, when I
    concluded we must be near our camp; so I hollered and my son
    answered me, and we moved on in the direction to the camp. We
    had gone but a little way when I heard my dogs make a warm start
    again; and I jumped down from my horse and gave him up to my
    friend, and told him I would follow them. He went on to the camp,
    and I went ahead after my dogs with all my might for a considerable
    distance, till at last night came on. The woods were very rough and
    hilly, and all covered over with cane.
    <p>
    I now was compel'd to move on more slowly; and was frequently
    falling over logs, and into the cracks made by the earthquakes, so
    that I was very much afraid I would break my gun. However I went
    on about three miles, when I came to a good big creek, which I
    waded. It was very cold, and the creek was about knee-deep; but I
    felt no great inconvenience from it just then, as I was all over wet with
    sweat from running, and I felt hot enough. After I got over this creek
    and out of the cane, which was very thick on all our creeks, I listened
    for my dogs. I found they had either treed or brought the bear to a
    stop, as they continued barking in the same place. I pushed on
    as near in the direction to the noise as I could, till I found the hill was
    too steep for me to climb, and so I backed and went down the creek
    some distance till I came to a hollow, and then took up that, till I
    come to a place where I could climb up the hill. It was mighty dark,
    and was difficult to see my way or anything else. When I got up the
    hill, I found I had passed the dogs; and so I turned and went to them.
    I found, when I got there, they had treed the bear in a large forked
    poplar, and it was setting in the fork.
    <p>
    I could see the lump, but not plain enough to shoot with any cer-
    tainty, as there was no moonlight; and so I set in to hunting for some
    dry brush to make me a light; but I could find none, though I could
    find that the ground was torn mightily to pieces by the cracks.
    <p>
    At last I thought I could shoot by guess, and kill him; so I
    pointed as near the lump as I could, and fired away. But the bear
    didn't come, he only clomb up higher, and got out on a limb, which
    helped me to see him better. I now loaded up again and fired, but this
    time he didn't move at all. I commenced loading for a third fire, but
    the first thing I knowed, the bear was down among my dogs, and they
    were fighting all around me. I had my big butcher in my belt, and I
    had a pair of dressed buckskin breeches on. So I took out my knife,
    and stood, determined, if he should get hold of me, to defend myself
    in the best way I could. I stood there for some time, and could now
    and then see a white dog I had, but the rest of them, and the bear,
    which were dark coloured, I couldn't see at all, it was so miserable
    dark. They still fought around me, and sometimes within three feet
    of me; but, at last, the bear got down into one of the cracks, that
    the earthquakes had made in the ground, about four feet deep, and
    I could tell the biting end of him by the hollering of my dogs. So
    I took my gun and pushed the muzzle of it about, till I thought I had
    it against the main part of his body, and fired; but it happened to be
    only the fleshy part of his foreleg. With this, he jumped out of the
    crack, and he and the dogs had another hard fight around me, as
    before. At last, however, they forced him back into the crack again,
    as he was when I had shot.
    <p>
    I had laid down my gun in the dark, and I now began to hunt for
    it; and, while hunting, I got hold of a pole, and I concluded I
    would punch him awhile with that. I did so, and when I would
    punch him, the dogs would jump in on him, when he would bite
    them badly, and they would jump out again. I concluded, as he
    would take punching so patiently, it might be that he would lie still
    enough for me to get down in the crack, and feel slowly along till I
    could find the right place to give him a dig with my butcher. So I got
    down, and my dogs got in before him and kept his head towards
    them, till I got along easily up to him; and placing my hand on his
    rump, felt for his shoulder, just behind which I intended to stick
    him. I made a lounge with my long knife, and fortunately stock him
    right through the heart; at which he just sank down, and I crawled out
    in a hurry. In a little time my dogs all come out too, and seemed
    satisfied, which was the way they always had of telling me that they
    had finished him.
    <p>
    I suffered very much that night with cold, as my leather breeches,
    and every thing else I had on, was wet and frozen. But I managed
    to get my bear out of this crack after several hard trials, and so I
    butchered him, and laid down to try to sleep. But my fire was very
    bad, and I couldn't find any thing that would burn well to make it
    any better; and I concluded I should freeze, if I didn't warm myself
    in some way by exercise. So I got up, and hollered a while, and then I
    would just jump up and down with all my might, and throw myself into
    all sorts of motions. But all this wouldn't do; for my blood was now
    getting cold, and the chills coming all over me. I was so tired, too,
    that I could hardly walk; but I thought I would do the best I could
    to save my life, and then, if I died, nobody would be to blame. So
    I went to a tree about two feet through, and not a limb on it for
    thirty feet, and I would climb up it to the limbs, and then lock my
    arms together around it, and slide down to the bottom again. This
    would make the insides of my legs and arms feel mighty warm and
    good. I continued this till daylight in the morning, and how often I
    clomb up my tree and slid down I don't know, but I reckon at least
    a hundred times.
    <p>
    In the morning I got my bear hong up so as to be safe, and then
    set out to hunt for my camp. I found it after a while, and McDaniel
    and my son were very much rejoiced to see me get back, for they
    were about to give me up for lost. We got our breakfasts, and then
    secured our meat by building a high scaffold, and covering it over. We
    had no fear of its spoiling, for the weather was so cold that it couldn't.
    <p>
    We now started after my other bear, which had caused me so much
    trouble and suffering; and before we got him, we got a start after
    another, and took him also. We went on to the creek I had crossed
    the night before and camped, and then went to where my bear was,
    that I had killed in the crack. When we examined the place, McDaniel
    said he wouldn't have gone into it, as I did, for all the bears in the
    woods.
    <p>
    We took the meat down to our camp and salted it, and also the
    last one we had killed; intending, in the morning, to make a hunt in
    the harricane again.
    <p>
    We prepared for resting that night, and I can assure the reader
    I was in need of it. We had laid down by our fire, and about ten
    o'clock there came a most terrible earthquake, which shook the
    earth so, that we were rocked about like we had been in a cradle. We
    were very much alarmed; for though we were accustomed to feel
    earthquakes, we were now right in the region which had been torn
    to pieces by them in 1812, and we thought it might take a notion and
    swallow us up, like the big fish did Jonah.
    <p>
    In the morning we packed up and moved to the harricane, where
    we made another camp, and turned out that evening and killed a
    very large bear, which made eight we had now killed in this hunt.
    <p>
    The next morning we entered the harricane again, and in little or
    no time my dogs were in full cry. We pursued them, and soon came
    to a thick cane brake, in which they had stop'd their bear. We got
    up close to him, as the cane was so thick that we couldn't see more
    than a few feet. Here I made my friend hold the cane a little open
    with his gun till I shot the bear, which was a mighty large one. I
    killed him dead in his tracks. We got him out and butchered him,
    and in a little time started another and killed him, which now made
    ten we had killed; and we know'd we couldn't pack any more home,
    as we had only five horses along; therefore we returned to the camp
    and salted up all our meat, to be ready for a start homeward next
    morning.
    <p>
    The morning came, and we packed our horses with the meat, and
    had as much as they could possibly carry, and sure enough cut out
    for home. It was about thirty miles, and we reached home the
    second day. I had now accommodated my neighbour with meat
    enough to do him, and had killed in all, up to that time, fifty-eight
    bears, during the fall and winter.
    <p>
    As soon as the time come for them to quit their houses and come
    out again in the spring, I took a notion to hunt a little more, and in
    about one month I killed forty-seven more, which made one hundred
    and five bears I had killed in less than one year from that time.
