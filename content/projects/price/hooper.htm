<p>
    By reference to memoranda, contemporaneously taken, of incidents
    to be recorded in the memoirs of Captain Suggs, we find that we have
    reached the most important period in the history of our hero----his
    assumption of a military command. And we beg the reader to believe,
    that we approach this portion of our subject with a profound regret
    at our own incapacity for its proper illumination. Would that thy pen,
    O! Kendall, were ours! Then would thy hero and ours----the nation's
    Jackson and the country's Suggs-go down to far posterity, equal
    in fame and honors, as in deeds! But so the immortal gods have not
    decreed! Not to Suggs was Amos given! Aye, jealous of his mighty
    feats, the thundering Jove denied an historian worthy of his puissance!
    Would that, like Caesar, he could write himself! Then, indeed, should
    Harvard yield him honors, and his country-justice!
    <p>
    Early in May of the year of grace-and excessive bank issues----
    1836, the Creek war was discovered to have broken out. During that
    month several persons, residing in the county of Tallapoosa, were
    cruelly murdered by the "inhuman savages;" and an exceedingly large
    number of the peaceful citizens of the state----men, women and chil-
    dren----excessively frightened. Consternation seized all! "Shrieks in-
    human" rent the air! The more remote from the scenes of blood, the
    greater the noise. The yeomanry of the country----those to whom,
    as we are annually told, the nation locks with confidence in all her
    perils----packed up their carts and wagons, and "incontinently" 
    departed for more peaceful regions! We think we see them now, "strung
    along the road," a day or two after the intelligence of the massacres
    below had reached the "settlement" of Captain Suggs! There goes
    old man Simmons, with his wife and three daughters, together with
    two feather beds, a few chairs, and a small assortment of pots and
    ovens, in a cart drawn by a bob-tail, gray pony. On the top-most
    bed, and forming the apex of this pile of animate and inanimate
    "luggage," sits the old tom-cat, whom the youngest daughter would
    not suffer to remain lest he might come to harm. "Who knows,"
    she exclaims, "what they might do to the poor old fellow?" On they
    toil! the old man's head, ever and anon, turned back to see if they
    are pursued by the remorseless foe; while the wife and daughters
    scream direfully, every ten minutes, as they discover in the distance
    a cow or a hog-"Oh, they'll kill us! they'll skelp us! they'll tar us all
    to pieces! Oh, Lord! daddy! oh, Lord!" But the old tom-cat sits there,
    gravely and quietly, the very incarnation of tom philosophy!
    <p>
    It was on Sunday that the alarm was sounded in the "Suggs settle-
    ment," and most of the neighbours were in attendance upon the
    "preaching of the word" by brother Snufflenosey, at Poplar Spring
    meeting-house, when the "runner" who brought the woful tidings,
    disclosed them at old Tom Rollins', by yelling, as he sat on his horse
    before the door,-"the Injuns is a-killin everybody below! I aint
    got time to stop! tell the neighbours!" Now, old Mr. Rollins and the
    "gals" were already at meeting, but the old lady, having stayed
    behind "to fix up a leetle," was, at the identical moment of the
    messenger's arrival, en chemise before a very small glass set in a frame
    of red paper, preparing to adorn her person with divers new articles
    of apparel, inclusive of a new blue-and-red-calico gown. But no sooner
    did her mind comprehend the purport of the words from without, than
    she sprang out of the house, "accoutred as she was," shrieking at
    every bound, "the Injuns! the Injuns!"----nor stopped until with face,
    neck, and bosom crimson as a strutting gobbler's snout, she burst into
    the meeting-house, and having once more screamed "the Injuns!" fell
    exhausted, at full length, upon the floor. "Will any of the breethring
    lend me a horse?" asked the Reverend Mr. Snufflenosey, wildly, as he
    bounded out of the pulpit, in very creditable style----"Wont none
    of you lend me one?" he repeated emphatically; and obtaining no
    answer, dashed off precipitately afoot! Then went up to Heaven the
    screams of fifty frightened women, in one vast discord, more dreadful
    than the war-squalls of an hundred cats in fiercest battle. Men, too,
    looked pale and trembled; while, strange to relate, all of the dozen
    young babies in attendance silently dilated their astonished eyes----
    struck utterly dumb at being so signally beaten at their own peculiar
    game!
    
<p>
    At length an understanding was somehow effected, that Taylor's
    store, five miles thence, should be the place of rendezvous, for that
    night at least; and then Mr. Snufflenosey's congregation tumbled itself
    forth as expeditiously as was possible.
    <p>
    Simon was "duly" at the store with his family, when the wagon,
    cart, and pony loads of "badly-scared" mortality began to arrive in
    the afternoon. He was there of course, and he was in his element.
    Not that Suggs is particularly fond of danger---albeit, he is a hero---
    but because he delighted in the noise and confusion, the fun and
    the free drinking, incident to such occasions. And he enjoyed these
    to the uttermost now, because he was well informed as to the state
    of feeling of the Indians, in all the country for ten miles around,
    and knew there was no danger. But Simon did not disclose this to the
    terrified throng at the store. Not he! Suggs was never the man to
    destroy his own importance in that sort of way. On the contrary, he
    magnified the danger, and endeavoured to impress upon the minds of
    the miscellaneous crowd "then and there" assembled, that he, Simon
    Suggs, was the only man at whose hands they could expect a deliv-
    erance from the imminent peril which impended.
    <p>
    "Gentlemen," said he impressively, "this here is a critercle time;
    the wild savage of the forest are beginnin' of a bloody, hostile war,
    which they're not a-gain' to spar nither age nor sek----not even to the
    women and children!"
    <p>
    "Gracious Lord above! what is a body to do!" exclaimed the portly
    widow Haycock, who was accounted wealthy, in consideration of the
    fact that she had a hundred dollars in money, and was the undisputed
    owner of one entire negro---"we shall all be skelped, and our truck
    all burnt up and destroyed! What shall we do!"
    <p>
    "That's the question," remarked Simon, as he stooped to draw a
    glass of whiskey from a barrel of that article---the only thing on
    sale in the "store"---"that's the question. Now, as for you women-
    folks"-here Suggs dropped a lump of brown sugar in his whiskey,
    and began to stir it with his finger, looking intently in the tumbler, the
    while-"as for you women-folks, it's plain enough what you've got
    to do"-here Simon tasted the liquor and added a little more sugar
    -"plain enough! You've only got to look to the Lord and hold your
    jaws; for that's all you kin do! But what's the 'sponsible men"-tak-
    ing his finger out of the tumbler, and drawing it through his mouth-
    "of this crowd to do? The inemy will be down upon us right away,
    and before mornin'"---Simon drank half the whiskey---"blood will
    flow like---like"---the Captain was bothered for a simile, and looked
    around the room for one, but finding none, continued---"like all the
    world! Yes, like all the world"---an idea suggested itself---"and the
    Tallapussey river! It'll pour out," he continued, as his fancy got rightly
    to work, "like a great gulpin ocean!-d-d if it don't!" And then
    Simon swallowed the rest of the whiskey, threw the tumbler down, and
    leaked around to observe the effect of this brilliant exordium.
    <p>
    The effect was tremendous!
    <p>
    Mrs. Haycock clasped her hands convulsively, and rolled up her
    eyes until the "whites" only could be seen. Old Mrs. Rollins-who
    by this time was fully clothed-and her two daughters had what
    Simon termed the "high-strikes" in one corner of the room, and kicked
    up their heels at a prodigious rate; while in another, a group of young
    women hugged one another most affectionately, sobbing hysterically
    all the time. Old granny Gilbreth sat in the middle of the floor,
    rocking her body back and forth, striking the palms of her hands
    on the planks as she bent forward, and clapping them together as
    she re-attained the perpendicular.
    <p>
    "My opinion," continued Simon, as he stooped to draw another
    tumbler of whiskey; "my opinion, folks, is this here. We ought to
    form a company right away, and make some man capting that aint
    afeard to fight----mind what I say, now----<i>that-aint-afeard-to-fight!</i>----
    some sober, stiddy feller"-here he sipped a little from the tumbler
    ----"that's a good hand to manage women and keep 'em from hollerin
    ----which they're a-needin' somethin' of the sort most damdibly, and I
    eech to git holt o' that one a-making that devilish racket in the corner,
    thar"----the noise in the corner was suddenly suspended----"and
    more'n all, a man that's acquainted with the country and the ways of
    the Injuns!" Having thus spoken, Suggs drank off the rest of the
    whiskey, threw himself into a military attitude, and awaited a reply.
    <p>
    "Suggs is the man," shouted twenty voices.
    <p>
    "Keep close to <i>him</i>, and you'll never git hurt," said a diminutive,
    yellow-faced, spindle-legged young man.
    <p>
    "D'ye think so now?" exclaimed Simon furiously, as he "planted"
    a tremendous kick on that part of the joker's person at which the
    boot's point is most naturally directed. "D'ye think so, now? Take
    that along, and next time keep your jaw, you slink, or I'll kick more
    clay outen you in a minute, than you can eat again in a month, you
    darned, little, dirt-eatin' deer-face!"
    <p>
    "Keep the children outen the way," said the little fellow, as he lay
    sprawling in the farthest corner of the room; "ef you don't, <i>Cap'en</i>
    Suggs will whip 'em all. He's a sight on children and people what's
    got the <i>yaller janders!"</i>
    <p>
    Simon heeded not the sarcasm, but turning to the men he asked-
<p>    
    "Now gentlemen, who'll you have for capting?"
    <p>
    "Suggs! Suggs! Suggs!" shouted a score and a half of masculine
    voices.
    <p>
    The women said nothing----only frowned.
    <p>
    "Gentle<i>men</i>," said Simon, a smile of gratified, but subdued pride
    playing about his mouth; "Gentle<i>men</i>, my respects----ladies, the same
    to you!"---and the Captain bowed---"I'm more'n proud to serve
    my country at the head of sich an independent and patriotic cumpany!
    Let who will run, gentle<i>men</i>, Simon Suggs will allers be found sticking
    thar, like a tick under a cow's belly---"
    <p>
    
    "Whar do you aim to bury your dead Injuns, Capten?" sarcastically
    inquired the little dirt-eater.
    <p>
    "I'll bury <i>you</i>, you little whifflin fice," said Captain Suggs in a rage;
    and he dashed at yellow-legs furiously.
    <p>
    "Not afore a body's dead, I reckon," replied the dirt-eater, running
    round the room, upsetting the women and trampling the children, in
    his efforts to escape. At last he gained the door, out of which he
    bounced and ran off.
    <p>
    "Darn the little cuss," said the Captain, when he saw that pursuit
    would be useless, "I oughtent to git aggrawated at him, no how. He's
    a poor signifiken runt, that's got the mark of the hackle-berry ponds
    on his legs yit, whar the water come to when he was a-getherin 'em,
    in his raisin' in Northkurliny. But I must put a stop to sich, and
    that right away;" and striding to the door, out of which he thrust his
    head, he made proclamation: "Oh yes! gentle<i>men</i>! Oh yes! This
    here store-house and two acres all round is now under <i>martial law</i>!
    If any man or woman don't mind my orders, I'll have 'em shot right
    away; and children to be whipped accordin' to size. By order of me,
    Simon Suggs, Capting of the"----the Captain paused.
    <p>
    "Tallapoosy Vollantares," suggested Dick Cannifax.
<p>
"The Tallapoosy Vollantares," added Suggs, adopting the suggestion;
"so let everybody look out, and walk the chalk!"
    <p>
    Thus was formed the nucleus of that renowned band of patriot
    soldiers, afterwards known as the "FORTY THIEVES"----a name in
    the highest degree inappropriate, inasmuch as the company, from
    the very best evidence we have been able to procure, never had upon
    its roll, at any time, a greater number of names than thirty-nine!
    <p>
    As became a prudent commander, Captain Suggs, immediately after
    the proclamation of martial law, set about rendering his position as
    strong as possible. A rude rail fence near by was removed and made
    to enclose the log store, and another building of the same sort, which
    was used as a stable. The company was then paraded, and a big drink
    dealt out to each man, and five men were detailed to serve as sentinels,
   one at each corner of the enclosure, and one at the fence in front of                                             
     the store door. The Captain then announced that he had appointed                                            
     Andy Snipes, "fast lewtenant," Bird Stinson "sekkunt ditto," and Dave                                      
            Lyon "sarjunt."                                                   
<p>
The guard was set, the women summarily quieted, the mass of the
                            company stowed away in the stable for the night; and the Captain and                
                                  "Lewtenant Snipes" sat down, with a bottle of bald-face between                  
                                them, to a social game of "six cards, seven up," by a fire in the middle
                                      of the enclosure. About this time, the widow Haycock desired to
                 possess herself of a certain "plug" of tobacco, wherewithal to supply
                      her pipe during the watches of the night. The tobacco was in her cart,
            which, with a dozen others, stood in the road twenty steps or so from   
                    the front door. Now, as the widow Haycock was arrayed rather
              grotesquely-in a red-flannel wrapper, with a cotton handkerchief about
             her head----she did not wish to be seen as she passed out. She there-
                                                   fore noiselessly slipped out, and, the sentinel having deserted his  
                                     post for a few moments to witness the playing between his officers, suc-
                           ceeded in reaching the cart unobserved. As she returned, however,
                                  with the weed of comfort in her hand, she was challenged by the
                              sentinel, who, hearing a slight noise, had come back to his post.
<p>                              
 "Stand!" said he, as the old lady was climbing the fence.
<p>      
                 "Blessed Master!" exclaimed Mrs. Haycock; but the soldier was
                             too much frightened to observe that she spoke English, or to recognize
                                                   her voice.
<p>      
                         "Give the counter-sign or I'll shoot," said he, bringing his gun to a
                                                  "present," but receding towards the fire as he spoke.
<p>      
                Instead of the counter-sign, Mrs. Haycock gave a scream, which
                       the sentinel, in his fright, mistook for the war-whoop, and instantly
                   fired. The widow dropped from the fence to the ground, on the out-
                 side, and the sentinel ran to the Captain's fire.
<p>      
                                             In a moment was heard the thundering voice of Captain Suggs:
 <p>                                             "Turn out, men! Kumpny fo-r-m!"
<p>       
                  The women in the store screamed, and the company formed imme-
                                                   diately in front of the door. The Captain was convinced that the
                       alarm was a humbug of some sort; but keeping up the farce, kept up
                                                   his own importance.
<p>      
                                             "Bring your guns to a level with your breasts, and fire through
                                                   the cracks of the fence!" he ordered.
<p>      
                                             An irregular volley was fired, which brought down a poney and
                                                   a yoke of steers, haltered to their owner's carts in the road; and
                                                   frightened "yellow-legs," (who had slyly taken lodgings in a little
                                                   wagon), nearly to death.
<p>      
                                             "Over the fence now! Hooraw! my galyunt voluntares!" shouted
    the Captain, made enthusiastic by the discharge of the guns.
    <p>
    The company scaled the fence.
    <p>
    "Now charge baggonets! Hooraw! Let 'em have the cold steel,
    my brave boys!"
    <p>
    This manoeuvre was executed admirably, considering the fact, that
    the company was entirely without bayonets or a foe. The men
    brought their pieces to the proper position, ran ten steps, and finding
    nothing else to pierce, drove the long, projecting ram-rods of their
    rifles deep in the mellow earth!
    <p>
    "Pickle all them skelps`,Capten Suggs, or they'll <i>spile!"</i> said a
    derisive voice, which was recognized as belonging to Yellow-legs, and a
    light form flitted from among the wagons and carts, and was lost in
    the darkness.
    <p>
    "Somebody kill that critter!" said Suggs, much excited. But the
    "critter" had "evaporated."
    <p>
    A careful examination of the field of battle was now made, and the
    prostrate bodies of the pony, the oxen, and the widow Haycock dis-
    covered, lying as they had fallen. From the last a slight moaning
    proceeded. A light was soon brought.
<p>    
    "What's the matter, widder----hurt?" inquired Suggs, raising up one
    of Mrs. Haycock's huge legs upon his foot, by way of ascertaining how
    much life was left.
    <p>
    "Only dead-that's all;" said the widow as her limb fell heavily
    upon the ground, with commendable resignation.
    <p>
    "Pshaw!" said Suggs, "you aint bad hurt. Whar-abouts did the
    bullet hit?" 
    <p>
    "All over! <i>only</i> shot all to pieces! It makes <i>no</i> odds tho'----kleen
    through and through----I'm a-goin' mighty fast!" replied the widow, as
    four stout men raised her from the ground and carried her into the
    house, where her wounds were demonstrated to consist of a contusion
    on the bump of philo-progenitiveness, and the loss of a half square
    inch of the corrugated integument of her left knee.
    <p>
    Captain Suggs and Lieutenant Snipes now resumed their game.
    <p>
    "Lewtenant,"----said Suggs, as he dealt the cards----"we must----
    there's the tray for low----we must <i>court-martial</i> that old 'oman in
    the mornin'."
    <p>
    "'Twon't do, Capting----the tray I mean----to be sure we must!
    She's vierlated the rules of war!"
    <p>
    "And Yaller-legs, <i>too</i>!" said Suggs.
    <p>
    "Yes, yes; and Yaller-legs too, ef we kin ketch him," replied 
    Lewtenant Snipes.
    <p>
    "Yes, d--d ef I don't!----court-martial 'em both, as sure as the sun
    rises---<i>drum-head</i> court-martial at that!"
