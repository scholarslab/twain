<p>
A steamboat on the Mississippi, frequently, in making her regular trips, carries between places varying from one to
two thousand miles apart; and, as these boats advertise to land passengers and freight at "all intermediate
landings," the heterogeneous character of the passengers of one of these up-country boats can scarcely be
imagined by one who has never seen it with his own eyes.
<p>
Starting from New Orleans in one of these boats, you will find yourself associated with men from every State in the
Union, and from every portion of the globe; and a man of observation need not lack for amusement or instruction
in such a crowd, if he will take the trouble to read the great book of character so favorably opened before him.
<p>
Here may be seen, jostling together, the wealthy Southern planter and the pedler of tin-ware from New
England the Northern merchant and the Southern jockey a venerable bishop, and a desperate gambler the land
speculator, and the honest farmer professional men of all creeds and characters Wolvereens, Suckers, Hoosiers,
Buckeyes, and Corncrackers, beside a "plentiful sprinkling" of the half-horse and half-alligator species of men, who
are peculiar to "old Mississippi," and who appear to gain a livelihood by simply going up and down the river. In the
pursuit of pleasure or business, I have frequently found myself in such a crowd.
<p>
On one occasion, when in New Orleans, I had occasion to take a trip of a few miles up the Mississippi, and I hurried
on board the well-known "high-pressure-and-beat-every-thing" steamboat "Invincible," just as the last note of the
last bell was sounding; and when the confusion and bustle that is natural to a boat's getting under way had
subsided, I discovered that I was associated in as heterogeneous a crowd as was ever got together. As my trip was
to be of a few hours' duration only, I made no endeavors to become acquainted with my  fellow-passengers, most
of whom would be together many days. Instead of this, I took out of my pocket the "latest paper," and more critically
than usual examined its contents; my fellow-passengers, at the same time, disposed of themselves in little groups.
<p>
While I was thus busily  employed in reading, and my companions were more busily  still employed, in discussing
such subjects as suited their humors best, we were most unexpectedly startled by a loud Indian whoop, uttered in
the "social hall," that part of the cabin fitted off for a bar; then was to be heard a loud crowing, which would not have
continued to interest us such sounds being quite common in that <i>place of spirits</i> had not the hero of
these windy accomplishments stuck his head into the cabin, and hallooed out, "Hurra for the Big Bear of
Arkansaw!"
<p>
Then might be heard a confused hum of voices, unintelligible, save in such broken sentences as "horse,"
"screamer," "lightning is slow," &c.
<p>
As might have been expected, this continued interruption, attracted the attention of every one in the cabin; all
conversation ceased, and in the midst of this surprise, the "Big Bear" walked into the cabin, took a chair, put his
feet on the stove, and looking back over his shoulder, passed the general and familiar salute "Strangers, how
are you?"
<p>
He then expressed himself as much at home as if he had been at "the Forks of Cypress," and "prehaps a little
more so."
<p>
Some of the company at this familiarity looked a little angry, and some astonished; but in a moment every face
was wreathed in a smile. There was something about the intruder that won the heart on sight. He appeared to be
a man enjoying perfect health and contentment; his eyes were as sparkling as diamonds, and good-natured to
simplicity. Then his perfect confidence in himself was irresistibly droll.
<p>
"Prehaps," said he, "gentlemen," running on without a person interrupting, "prehaps you have been to New
Orleans often; I never made<i> the first visit before</i>, and I don't intend to make another in a crow's life. I am
thrown away in that ar place, and useless, that ar a fact. Some of the gentlemen thar called me green well,
prehaps I am, said I, <i>but I arn't so at home;</i> and if I ain't off my trail much, the heads of them
perlite chaps themselves wern't much the hardest; for according to my notion, they were <i>real know-
nothings,</i> green as a pumpkin-vine couldn't, in farming, I'll bet, raise a crop of turnips; and as for shooting,
they'd miss a barn if the door was swinging, and that, too, with the best rifle in the country. And then they talked
to me 'bout hunting, and laughed at my calling the principal game in Arkansaw poker, and high-low-jack.
<p>
"'Prehaps,' said I, 'you prefer checkers and roulette;' at this they laughed harder than ever, and asked me if I lived
in the woods, and didn't know what <i>game</i> was?
<p>
"At this, I rather think <i>I</i> laughed.

<p>
"'Yes,' I roared, and says, I, 'Strangers, if you'd ask me <i>how we got our meat </i>in Arkansaw, l'd a told you
at once, and given you a list of varmints that would make a caravan, beginning with the bar, and ending off with
the cat; that's <i>meat </i>though, not game.
<p>
"Game, indeed, that's what city folks call it; and with them it means chipper-birds and shite-pokes; may be such
trash live in my digging, but I arn't noticed them yet: a bird anyway is too trifling. I never did shoot at but one, and
I'd never forgiven myself for that, had it weighed less than forty pounds. I wouldn't draw a rifle on anything less
heavy than that; and when I meet with another wild turkey of the same size, I will crap him."
<p>
"A wild turkey weighing forty pounds!" exclaimed twenty  voices in the cabin at once.
<p>
"Yes, strangers, and wasn't it a whopper? You see, the thing was so fat that it couldn't fly  far; and when he fell
out of the tree, after I shot him, on striking the ground he bust open behind, and the way the pound gobs of tallow
rolled out of the opening was perfectly  beautiful."
<p>
"Where did all that happen?" asked a cynical-looking Hoosier.
<p>
"Happen! happened in Arkansaw: where else could it have happened, but in the creation State, the finishing-up
country a State where the sile runs down to the centre of the 'arth, and government gives you a title to every
inch of it? Then its airs just breathe them, and they will make you snort like a horse. It's a State without  a fault,
it is."
<p>
"Excepting mosquitoes," cried the Hoosier.
<p>
"Well, stranger, except them; for it ar a fact that they are rather <i>enormous</i>, and do push themselves in
somewhat troublesome. But, stranger, they never stick twice in the same place; and give them a fair chance for
a few months, and you will get as much above noticing them as an alligator. They can't hurt my feelings, for they
lay under the skin; and I never knew but one case of injury resulting from them, and that was
to a Yankee: and they take worse to foreigners, any how, than they do to natives. But the way
they used that fellow up! first they punched him until he swelled up and busted; then he sup-
per-a-ted, as the doctor called it, until he was as raw as beef; then, owing to the warm
weather, he tuck the ager, and finally he tuck a steamboat and left the country. He was the
only man that ever tuck mosquitoes at heart that I knowd of.
<p>
"But mosquitoes is natur, and I never find fault with her. If they ar large, Arkansaw is large, her
varmints ar large, her trees ar large, her rivers ar large, and a small mosquito would be of no
more use in Arkansaw than preaching in a cane-brake."
<p>
This knock-down argument in favor of big mosquitoes used the Hoosier up, and the logician
started on a new track, to explain how numerous bear were in his "digging," where he
represented them to be "about as plenty as blackberries, and a little plentifuller."
<p>
Upon the utterance of this assertion, a timid little man near me inquired, if the bear in
Arkansaw ever attacked the settlers in numbers.
<p>
"No," said our hero, warming with the subject, "no, stranger, for you see it ain't the natur of
bear to go in droves; but the way they squander about in pairs and single ones is edifying.
<p>
"And then the way I hunt them the old black rascals know the crack of my gun as well as they
know a pig's squealing. They grow thin in our parts, it frightens them so, and they  do take the
noise dreadfully, poor things. That gun of mine is a perfect <i>epidemic among </i>bear: if not
watched closely, it will go off as quick on a warm scent as my dog Bowieknife will: and then
that dog whew! why the fellow thinks that the world is full of bear, he finds them so easy. It's
lucky he don't talk as well as think; for with his natural modesty, if he should suddenly learn
how much he is acknowledged to be ahead of all other dogs in the universe, he would be
astonished to death in two minutes.
<p>
"Strangers, that dog knows a bear's way as well as a horse-jockey knows a woman's: he
always barks at the right time, bites at the exact place, and whips without getting a scratch.
<p>
"I never could tell whether he was made expressly to hunt bear, or whether bear was made
expressly for him to hunt; anyway, I  believe they we're ordained to go together as naturally
as Squire Jones says a man and woman is, when he moralizes in marrying a couple. In fact,
Jones once said, said he, 'Marriage according to law is a civil contract of divine origin; it's
common to all countries as well as Arkansaw, and people take to it as naturally as Jim
Doggett's Bowie-knife takes to bear.'"
<p>
"What season of the year do your hunts take place?" inquired a gentlemanly foreigner, who, from some peculiarities of his
baggage, I suspected to be an Englishman, on some hunting expedition, probably at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.
<p>
"The season for bear hunting, stranger," said the man of Arkansaw, "is generally all the year round, and the hunts take place
about as regular. I read in history that varmints have their  fat season, and their lean season. That is not the case in Arkansaw,
feeding as they  do upon the <i>spontenacious </i>productions of the sire, they have one continued fat season the year round;
though in winter things in this way is rather more greasy than in summer, I must admit. For that reason bear with us run in warm
weather, but in winter they only waddle.
<p>
"Fat, fat! its an enemy to speed; it tames every thing that has plenty of it. I have seen wild turkeys, from its influence, as gentle
as chickens. Run a bear in this fat condition, and the way it improves the critter for eating is amazing; it sort of mixes the ile up
with the meat, until you can't tell t'other from which. I've done this often.
<p>
"I recollect one perty morning in particular, of putting an old he fellow on the stretch, and considering the weight he carried, he
run well. But the dogs soon tired him down, and when I came up with him wasn't he in a beautiful sweat I might say fever; and
then to see his tongue sticking out of his mouth a feet, and his sides sinking and opening like a bellows, and his cheeks so fat
that he couldn't look cross. In this fix I blazed at him, and pitch me naked into a briar patch, if the steam didn't come out of the
bullet-hole ten foot in a straight line. The fellow, I reckon, was made on the high-pressure system, and the lead sort of bust his
biler."
<p>
"That column of steam was rather curious, or else the bear must have been very warm," observed the foreigner, with a laugh.
<p>
"Stranger, as you observe, that bear was WARM, and the blowing off of the steam show'd it, and also how hard the varmint had
been run. I have no doubt if he had kept on two miles farther his insides would have been stewed; and I expect to meet with a
varmint yet of extra bottom, that will run himself into a skinfull of bear's grease: it is possible; much onlikelier things have
happened."
<p>
"Whereabouts are these bears so abundant?" inquired the foreigner, with increasing interest.
<p>
"Why, stranger, they inhabit the neighborhood of my settlement, one of the prettiest places on old Mississipp a perfect location,
and no mistake; a place that had some defects until the river made the 'cut-off' at 'Shirt-tail bend,' and that remedied the evil, as
it brought my cabin on the edge of the river a great advantage in wet weather, I assure you, as you can now roll a barrel of
whiskey into
my yard in high water from a boat, as easy as falling off a log. It's a great improvement, as toting it by land in a jug,
as I used to do,<i> evaporated</i> it too fast, and it became expensive.
<p>
"Just stop with me, stranger, a month or two, or a year, if you like, and you will appreciate my place. I can give you
plenty to eat; for beside hog and hominy, you can have bear-ham, and bearsausages, and a mattress of bear-skins
to sleep on, and a wildcat-skin, pulled off hull, stuffed with corn-shucks, for a pillow. That bed would put you to sleep
if you had the rheumatics in every joint in your body. I call that ar bed, a <i>quietus</i>.
<p>
"Then look at my 'pre-emption' the government ain't got another like it to dispose of. Such timber, and such bottom
land,  why you can't preserve anything natural you plant in it unless you pick it young, things thar will grow out of
shape so quick.
<p>
"I once planted in those diggins a few potatoes and beets; they took a fine start, and after that, an ox team couldn't
have kept them from growing. About that time I went off to old Kaintuck on business, and did not hear from them
things in three months, when I accidentally stumbled on a fellow who had crapped in at my place, with an idea of
buying me out.
<p>
" 'How did you like things?' said I.
<p>
" 'Pretty well,' said he; 'the cabin is convenient, and the timber land is good; but that bottom land ain't worth the first
red cent.'"
<p>
"'Why?' said I.
<p>
"''Cause,' said he.
<p>
"' 'Cause whet?' said I.
<p>
"''Cause it's full of cedar stumps and Indian mounds, and <i>can't be cleared.'</i>
<p>
"'Lord,' said I. 'them ar "Indian mounds" tater hills.'
<p>
"As I had expected, the crop was overgrown and useless: the sile is too rich, <i>and planting in Arkansaw is dangerous.</i>
<p>
"I had a good-sized sow killed in that same bottom land. The old thief stole an ear of corn, and took it down to eat where she
slept at night. Well, she left a grain or two on the ground, and lay down on them: before morning the corn shot up, and the
percussion killed her dead. I don't plant any more: natur intended Arkansaw for a hunting ground, and I go according to natur."
<p>
The questioner, who had thus elicited the description of our hero's settlement, seemed to be perfectly  satisfied, and said no
more; but the "Big Bear of Arkansaw" rambled on from one thing to another with a volubility perfectly astonishing,
occasionally disputing with those around him, particularly with a "live Sucker" from Illinois, who had
the daring to say that our Arkansaw friend's stories "smelt rather tall." The evening was nearly spent by the incidents we have detailed; and
conscious that my own association with so singular a personage would probably  end before morning, I asked him if he would not give me
a description of some particular bear hunt; adding, that I took great interest in  such things, though I was no sportsman. The desire seemed
to please him, and he squared himself round towards me, saying, that he could give me an idea of a bear hunt that was never beat in this
world, or in any other. His manner was so singular, that half of his story consisted in his excellent way of telling it, the great peculiarity of
which was, the happy manner he had of emphasizing the prominent parts of his conversation. As near as I can recollect, I have italicized the
words, and given the story in his own way.
<p>
"Stranger," said he, "in bear hunts I <i>am numerous,</i> and which particular one, as you say, I shall tell, puzzles me.
<p>
"There was the old she devil I shot at the Hurricane last fall then there was the old hog thief I popped over at the Bloody Crossing, and
then Yes, I have it! I will give you an idea of a hunt, in which the greatest bear was killed that ever lived, <i>none excepted;</i> about
an old fellow that I hunted, more or less, for two or three years; and if that ain't a <i>particular bear hunt,</i> I ain't got one to tell.
<p>
"But in the first place, stranger, let me say, I am pleased with you, because you ain't ashamed to gain information by asking and listening;
and that's what I say to Countess's pups every day when I'm home; and I have got great hopes of them ar pups, because they are continually
<i>nosing</i> about; and though they stick it sometimes in the wrong place, they gain experience any how, and may learn something useful
to boot.
<p>
"Well, as I was saying about this big bear, you see when I and some more first settled in our region, we were drivin to hunting naturally; we
soon liked it, and after that we found it an easy matter to make the thing our business. One old chap who had pioneered 'afore us, gave us
to understand that we had settled in the right place. He dwelt upon its merits until it was affecting, and showed us, to prove his assertions,
more scratches on the bark of the sassafras trees, than I ever saw chalk marks on a tavern door 'lection time.
<p>
"'Who keeps that ar reckoning?' said I.
<p>
"'The bear,' said he.
<p>
" 'What for?' said I.
<p>
" 'Can't tell,' said he; 'but so it is: the bear bite the bark and wood too, at the highest point from the ground they can reach, and you can tell,
by the marks,' said he,'the length of the bear to an inch.'
<p>
"'Enough,' said I; 'I've learned something here a'ready, and I'll put it in practice.'
<p>
"Well, stranger, just one month from that time I killed a bear, and told its exact length before I measured it, by 
those very marks; and when I did that, I swelled up considerably I've been a prouder man ever since.
<p>
"So I went on, laming something every day, until I was reckoned a buster, and allowed to be decidedly the best
bear hunter in my district; and that is a reputation as much harder to earn than to be reckoned first man in
Congress, as an iron ramrod is harder than a toadstool.
<p>
"Do the varmints grow over-cunning by being fooled with  by greenhorn hunters, and by this means get
troublesome, they send for me, as a matter of course; and thus I do my own hunting, and most of my neighbors'.
I walk into the varmints though, and it has become about as much the same to me as drinking. It is told in two
sentences 
<p>
"A bear is started, and he is killed.
<p>
"The thing is-- somewhat monotonous now I know just how much they will run, where they will tire, how
much they will growl, and what a thundering time I will have in getting their meat home. I could give you the
history of the chase with all the particulars at the commencement, I know the signs so well <i>Stranger, I'm
certain.</i> Once I met with a match, though, and I will tell you about it; for a common hunt would not be
worth relating.
<p>
"On a fine fall day, long time ago, I was trailing about for bear, and what should I see but fresh marks on the
sassafras trees, about eight inches above any in the forests that I knew of. Says I, 'Them marks is a hoax, or it
indicates the d t bear that was ever grown.' In fact, stranger, I couldn't believe it was real, and I went on.
Again: I saw the same marks, at the same height, and <i>I knew the thing lived.</i> That conviction came
home to my soul like an earthquake.
<p>
"Says I, 'Here is something a-purpose for me: that bear is mine, or I give up the hunting business.' The very next
morning, what should I see but a number of buzzards hovering over my corn-field. 'The rascal has been there,'
said I, for that sign is certain'; and, sure enough, on examining, I found the bones of what had been as beautiful
a hog the day before, as was ever raised by a Buckeye. Then I tracked the critter out of the field to the woods,
and all the marks he left behind, showed me that he was <i>the</i> bear.
<p>
"Well, stranger, the first fair chase I ever had with that big critter, I saw him no less than three distinct times at
a
distance; the dogs run him over eighteen miles and broke down, my horse gave out, and I was as nearly used up 
as a man can be, made on <i>my</i> principle, <i>which is patent.</i>.
<p>
"Before this adventure, such things were unknown to me as possible; but, strange as it was, that bear got me used to 
it before I was done with him; for he got so at last, that he would leave me on a long chase quite easy. How he did it, 
I never could understand.
<p>
"That a bear runs at all, is puzzling; but how this one could tire down and bust up a pack of hounds and a horse, that were used to overhauling
everything they started after in no time, was past my understanding. Well, stranger, that bear finally got so sassy, that he used to help himself
to a hog off my premises whenever he wanted one; the buzzards followed after what he left, and so, between bear and buzzard, I rather think
I got <i>out of pork.</i>
<p>
"Well, missing that bear so often took hold of my vitals, and I wasted away. The thing had been carried too far, and it reduced me in flesh
faster than an ager. I would see that bear in every thing I did: <i>he hunted me,</i> and that, too, like a devil, which I began to think he
was.
<p>
"While in this shaky fix, I made preparations to give him a last brush, and be done with it. Having completed everything to my satisfaction,
I started at sunrise, and to my great joy, I discovered from the way the dogs run, that they  were near him. Finding his trail was nothing, for
that had become as plain to the pack as a turnpike road.
<p>
"On we went, and coming an an open country, what should I see but the bear very leisurely ascending a hill, and the dogs close at his heels,
either a match for him this time in speed, or else he did not care to get out of their way I don't know which. But wasn't he a beauty, though!
I loved him like a brother.
<p>
"On he went, until he came to a tree, the limbs of which formed a crotch about six feet from the ground. Into this crotch he got and seated
himself, the dogs yelling all around it; and there he sat eyeing them as quiet as a pond in low water.
<p>
"A greenhorn friend of mine, in company, reached shooting distance before me, and blazed away, hitting the critter in the centre of his
forehead. The bear shook his head as the ball struck it, and then walked down from that tree, as gently as a lady would from a carriage.
<p>
" 'Twas a beautiful sight to see him do that he was in such a rage, that he seemed to be as little afraid of the dogs as if they had been sucking
pigs; and the dogs warn't slow in making a ring around him at a respectful distance, I tell you; even Bowieknife himself,
stood off. Then the way his eyes flashed! why the fire of them  
      would have singed a cat's hair; in fact, that bear was in a wrath all
      over. Only one pup came near him, and he was brushed out so totally
      with the bear's left paw, that he entirely disappeared; and that made
       the old dogs more cautious stir]. In the mean time, I came up, and
      taking deliberate aim, as a man should do, at his side, just back of his 
      foreleg, if my au'' did not snap, call me a coward, and I won't take it  
      personal.
<p>           "Yes, stranger, it snapped, and I could not find a cap about my
person. While in this predicament, I turned round to my fool friend
               'Bill,' says I, 'you're an ass you're a fool you might as well
              have tried to kill that bear by barking the tree under his belly, as to
              have done it by hitting him in the head. Your shot has made a tiger
of him; and blast me, if a dog gets killed or wounded when they
              come to blows, I will stick my knife into your liver, I will .' My
              wrath was up. I had lost my caps, my gun had snapped, the fellow
              with me had fired at the bear's head, and I expected every moment to
              see him close in with the dogs and kill a dozen of them at least. In
this thing I was mistaken; for the bear leaped over the ring formed
              by the dogs, and giving a fierce growl, was off the pack, of course,
in full cry after him. The run this time was short, for coming to the
edge of a lake, the varmint jumped in, and swam to a little island in
the lake, which it reached, just a moment before the dogs.
<p>
"'I'll have him now,' said I, for I had found my caps in the <i>lining</i>
of my coat so, rolling a log into the lake, I paddled myself across
to the island, just as the dogs had cornered the bear in a thicket.
              I rushed up and fired at the same time the critter leaped over the
              dogs and came within three feet of me, running like mad, he jumped
              into the lake, and tried to mount the log I had just deserted, but
              every time he got half his body on it, it would roll over and send him
         under; the dogs, too, got around him, and pulled him about, and
 finally Bowieknife clenched with him, and they sunk into the lake
together.
<p>
  "Stranger, about this time I was excited, and I stripped off my
  coat, drew my knife, and intended to have taken a part with Bowie
  knife myself, when the bear rose to the surface. But the varmint staid
  under Bowieknife came up alone, more dead than alive, and with
  the pack came ashore.
  <p>
"'Thank God!' said I, 'the old villain has got his deserts at last.'
<p>                                     
"Determined to have the body, I cut a grape-vine for a rope, and
  dove down where I could see the bear in the water, fastened my rope
  to his leg, and fished him, with great difficulty, ashore. Stranger, may
  I be chawed to death by young alligators, if the thing I looked at
wasn't a <i>she</i> bear, and <i>and not  the old critter after all.</i>
<p>
 "The way matters got mixed on that island was onaccountably curious, and thinking of it made me more than ever convinced that I was hunting
the devil himself. I went home that night and took to my bed the thing was killing me. The entire team of Arkansaw in bear-hunting
acknowledged himself used up, and the fact sunk into my feelings as a snagged boat will in the Mississippi. I grew as cross as a bear with two
cubs and a sore tail. The thing got out 'mong my neighbors, and I was asked how come on that individ-u-al that never lost a bear when once
started? and if that same individ-u-al didn't wear telescopes when he turned a she-bear, of ordinary size, into an old he one, a little larger than
a horse?
<p>
" 'Prehaps,' said I, 'friends' getting wrathy 'prehaps you want to call somebody a liar?'
<p>
 "'Oh, no,' said they, 'we only heard of such things being <i>rather common </i>of late, but we don't believe one word of it; oh, no,' and
then they would ride off, and laugh like so many hyenas over a dead nigger.
<p>
"It was too much, and I determined to catch that bear, go to Texas, or die, and I made my preparations accordin'.
<p>
"I had the pack shut up and rested. I took my rifle to pieces, and fled it.
<p>
"I put caps in every pocket about my person,<i> for fear of the lining.</i>
<p>
"I then told my  neighbors, that on Monday  morning naming the day I would start THAT BEAR  and bring him home with me, or they might
divide my settlement among them, the owner having disappeared.
<p>
"Well, stranger, on the morning previous to the great day of my hunting expedition, I went into the woods near my house, taking my gun and
Bowieknife along, just <i>from habit,</i> and there sitting down, also from habit, what should I see, getting over my fence, but <i>the
bear!</i> Yes, the old varmint was within a hundred yards of me, and the way he walked <i>over that fence</i> stranger; he loomed up like
a <i> black mist,</i> he seemed so large, and he walked right towards me.
<p>
"I raised myself, took deliberate aim, and fired. Instantly the varmint wheeled, gave a yell, and <i>walked through the fence</i>, as easy as
a falling tree would through a cobweb.
<p>
"I started after, but was tripped up by my inexpressibles, which, either from habit or the excitement of the moment, were about my heels, and
before I had really gathered myself up, I heard the old varmint groaning, like a thousand sinners, in a thicket near by, and, by the time I reached
him, he was a corpse.
<p>
"Stranger, it took five niggers and myself to put that carcass on a
mule's back, and old long-ears waddled under his load, as if he was foundered in every leg of his body; and with a
common whopper of a bear, he would have trotted off, and enjoyed himself.
<p>
"'Twould astonish you to know how big he was: I made a <i>bedspread of his skin,</i> and the way it used to cover
my  bear mattress, and leave several feet on each side to tuck up, would have delighted you. It was, in fact, a creation
bear, and if it had lived in Samson's time, and had met him in a fair fight, he would have licked him in the twinkling
of a dice-box.
<p>
"But, stranger, I never liked the way I hunted him, <i>and missed him.</i> There is something curious about it, that
I never could understand,  and I never was satisfied at his giving in <i>so easy at last.</i> Prehaps he had heard
of my preparations to hunt him the next day, so he jist guv up, like Captain Scott's coon, to save his wind to grunt with
in dying; but that ain't likely. My private opinion is, that that bear was an <i>an unhuntable bear, and died when
his time come."</i>
<p>
When this story was ended, our hero sat some minutes with his auditors, in a grave silence; I saw there was a mystery
to him connected with the bear whose death he had just related, that had evidently made a strong impression on his
mind. It was also evident that there was some superstitious awe connected with the affair, a feeling common with
all "children of the wood," when they meet with anything out of their every-day experience.
<p>
He was the first one, however, to break the silence, and, jumping up, he asked all present to "liquor" before going to
bed, a thing which he did, with a number of companions, evidently to his heart's content.
<p>
Long before day, I was put ashore at my  place of destination, and I can only  follow with the reader, in imagination,
our Arkansas friend, in his adventures at the "Forks of Cypress," on the Mississippi.
