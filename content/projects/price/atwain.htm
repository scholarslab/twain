The realism and humor of Mark Twain is the result and culmination of Southwesterm humor.
Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens, his life began in the small village of Florida, Missouri--
moving to Hannibal, Missouri within a few years.  It was Hannibal that served as Twain's model
town for <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>.  Twain was apprenticed to a printer
in 1847 and by 1850 was working with his brother Orion's newspaper, the Hannibal
<i>Journal</i>.
<p>
It was on May 1, 1852 that Twain wrote his first story--a Southwestern humor sketch.
<A HREF="dandy.htm">"The Dandy Frightening the Squatter"</A> was published in the Boston
<i>Carpet-Bag</i> and was Twain's first published literary work.   Soon after this, Twain left to
become a journeyman printer and traveled throughout the north until his well known decision to
become a river boat pilot on the Mississippi River in 1857.  After a short stint with the
Confederate Army in 1861, Twain spent the next six years in the West as a miner, newspaper
reporter and writer.  It was during these years that Twain developed his insight and appreciation
for the Southwestern way of life through personal experience.  <A
HREF="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/twainram.html">"Jim Blaine and His
Grandfather's Old Ram"</A>and <A HREF="frog.htm">"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of
Calaveras County"</A> are Southwestern humor sketches that Twain penned soon after.
<p>
The best of American humorists, Twain employed his exposure to early Southwestern humor in
his writing through a blending of its facets into his own style.  Whereas early Southwestern
humor sketches created a "gentleman" narrator who condescendingly described a "frontier
clown" figure, Twain fused the two characters.  He transforms the vernacular figure and the
narrator into one character who no longer condescends to laugh at the expense of others, but
who creates humor from his own mishaps and naivete.  This character allows for a more
complex psychological study of societal issues and allows Twain to examine the American mind
with more complexity than earlier Southwestern humorists.
<p>
Although some portions of Twain's work are considered violent by contemporary readers, his
emphasis on brutal behavior is greatly diminished when compared to the work of early
Southwestern humorists.  An audience consisting of many female readers may be one factor in
this change.  Early Southwestern humor was predominately circulated through Porter's <A
HREF="spirit.htm"><i>Spirit of the Times</i></A>.  This nineteenth-century sporting magazine
undoubtedly addressed a predominately male audience who typically enjoyed the rough humor
of the sketches.  Yet Twain's audience knew no limitation--appealing to male and female, adult
and child--requiring more decorum within the social boundaries of the day.
<p>
Twain is an American icon.  He is equally familiar to Americans today as in his prime over one
hundred years ago.  This popularity is due to an appeal which transcends regional boundaries as
well as generational changes.  Unlike early Southwest humorists, Twain is not a vehement
Southern secessionist nor a passionate literary advocate for a particular political party.  On the
contrary, Twain grapples with the problematic issues relevant to all regions of the country in his
time and ours.
