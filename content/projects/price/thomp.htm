<p>
    'Tis really astonishin what a monstrous sight of mischief there is in
    a pint of rum. If one of 'em was to be submitted to an analization,
    as the doctors call it, it would be found to contain all manner of
    devilment that ever entered the hed of man, from cussin and stealin
    up to murder and whippin his own mother, and nonsense enuff to
    turn all the men in the world out of their senses. If a man's got any
    badness in him, it'll bring it out jest as sassafras tea does the measles,
    and if he's a good for nothin sort of feller, without no bad traits in
    pertikeler, it'll bring out all his greenness. It affects different people
    in different ways---it makes some men monstrous brave and full of
    fight, and some it makes cowards---some it makes rich and happy,
    and some poor and miserable; and it has a different effect on different
    people's eyes---some it makes see double, and some it makes so
    blind that they can't tell themselves from a side of bacon. One of
    the worst cases of rum-foolery that I've heard of for a long time, tuk
    place in Pineville last fall.
<p>    
    Bill Sweeney and Tom Culpepper is the two greatest old coveys in
    our settlement for coon-huntin. The fact is, they don't do much of
    anything else, and when they can't ketch nothin you may depend
    coons is scarce. Well, one night they had everything reddy for a regu-
    lar hunt, but owin to some extra good fortin, Tom had got a pocket-
    pistol, as he called it, of reglar old Jimmakey, to keep off the rumatics.
    After takin a good startin horn, they went out on their hunt, with
    their life-wood torch a blazin, and the dogs a barkin and yelpin like
    forty thousand. Evry now and then stoppin to wait for the dogs, they
    would drink one another's helth, till they begun to feel very comfortable,
    and chatted away bout one thing and another, without mindin
    much which way they was gwine. Bimeby they cum to a fence.
    Well, over they got, 'thout much difficulty.
    <p>

    "Who's fence is this?" ses Bill.
<p>    
    "'Taint no matter," ses Tom, "let's take suthin to drink."
    <p>
    After takin a drink they went on, wonderin what on yearth had
    cum of the dogs. Next thing they cum to was a terrible muddy
    branch. After pullin through the briers and gettin on tother side,
    they tuck another drink, and after gwine a little ways they cum to
    another branch, and a little further they cum to another fence---a
    monstrous high one this time.
    <p>
    "Whar upon yearth is we got to, Culpepper?" ses Bill, "I never
    seed sich a heap of branches and fences in these parts."
    <p>
    "Why," ses Tom, "it's all old Sturlin's doins----you know he's
    always bildin fences and making infernal improvements, as he calls
    'em. But never mind---we's through them now."
    <p>
    "Guess we is," ses Bill; "here's the all-firedest tall fence yet."
    <p>
    Share enuff, thar they was right agin another fence. By this time,
    they begun to be considerable tired and limber in the gints, and it was
    sich a terrible high fence---Tom dropped the last piece of the torch,
    and thar they was in the dark.
    <p>
    "Now you is done it," ses Bill.
    <p>
    Tom know'd he had, but he thought it was no use to grieve over
    spilled milk, so ses he, "Never mind, old hoss----cum ahead, and
    I'll take you out," and the next minit kerslash he went into the water.
    <p>
    Bill hung on to the fence with both hands like he thought it was
    slewin round to throw him off.
    <p>
    "Hellow, Tom," ses he, "whar in the world is you got to?"
    <p>
    "Here I is," ses Tom, spoutin the water out of his mouth, and coffin
    like he'd swallowed something. "Look out, thar's another branch
    here."
<p>    
    "Name o 'sense, whar is we?" ses Bill. "If this isn't a fancy country,
    dad fetch my buttons."
    <p>
    "Yes, and a branchy one, too," ses Tom; "and the highest, and
    deepest, and thickest that I ever seed in my born days."
<p>    
"Which way is you?" ses Bill.
    <p>
    "Here, rite over the branch."
    <p>
    The next minit in Bill went, up to his middle in the branch.
    <p>
    "Cum ahead," ses Tom, "let's go home."
    <p>
    "Cum thunder! in such a place as this, whar a man haint more'n got
    his cute tail unhitched from a fence, fore he's over his head and ears
    in the water."
    <p>
    After gettin out and feelin about in the dark a little, they got
    together agin. After takin another drink, they sot out for home,
    denouncin the fences and the branches, and helpin one another up now
    and then; but they hadn't got more'n twenty yards fore they brung up
    all standin in the middle of another branch. After gettin thro' the
    branch and gwine about ten steps, they was brung to a halt by another
    fence.
    <p>
    "Dad blame my pictur," ses Bill, "if I don't think we is bewitched.
    Who upon yearth would bild fences all over creation this way?"
    <p>
    It was but a ower's job to get over this one, but after they got on
    the top they found the ground on tother side 'thout much trouble.
    This time the bottle was broke, and they come monstrous near having
    a fight about the catastrofy. But it was a very good thing, it was, for
    after crossin two or three more branches, and climbin as many more
    fences, it got to be daylight, and they found out that<i> they had been
    climbin the same fence all night</i>, not more'n a hundred yards from
    whar they first cum to it.
    <p>
    Bill Sweeney ses he can't account for it no other way but that the
    licker sort o' turned their heads, and he says he does really believe
    if it hadn't gin out they'd been climbin the same fence, and wadin
    that same branch till yet. Bill promised his wife to jine the Temper-
    ance Society if she won't never say no more bout that Coon-Hunt.
