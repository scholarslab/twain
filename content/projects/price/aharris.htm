<center><h2>GEORGE WASHINGTON HARRIS</h2></center>

<b>
George Washington Harris was born near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 20, 1814.  In 1819
he moved to Knoxville, Tennessee with his older half-brother, Samuel Bell.  He spent the
majority of his life in this young, frontier community of eastern Tennessee -- soaking in the life
of the frontier.  By the age of twelve, Harris was working as an apprentice in Samuel Bell's
metalworking shop.  He married Mary Emiline Nance in 1835 and within a few years purchased
acreage in Blout County, in Tucaleeche Cove at the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains.  
<p>
Harris received very little formal education but was an avid observer of humanity.  His
experiences in the rough mountain communities of Tennessee allowed him to appreciate the
nuances of folk stories, working class desires and frustrations, and the vernacular of the southern
yeoman.  Harris was a jack-of-all-trades and worked as a steamboat captain, metalsmith, railroad
conductor, postmaster, farmer, sawmill manager and copper mill manager in his lifetime. 
Alongside these varied occupations, Harris was also a politician and writer.  
<p>
Harris' first writing was in the form of political articles for the Knoxville <i>Argus</i> in the
late 1830's.  In 1843 he began contributing to William T. Porter's <A
HREF="spirit.htm"><i>Spirit of the Times</i></A>
under an assumed name.  Harris' greatest achievement-- his invention of Sut Lovingood --
appears in 1854 with "Sut Lovengood's Daddy Acting Horse" in the <i>Spirit</i>. Sut became
Harris' most famous and influential character--often acting as Democratic Party
political propaganda--and always serving in an anti-Republican and anti-Yankee role.  Sut
becomes well known as a <A HREF="fool.htm">"nat'ral born durn'd fool"</A> in popular
stories like <A HREF="harris2.htm">"Mrs. Yardley's Quilting"</A>and <A
HREF="burns1.htm">"Sicily Burn's Wedding"</A>.  
<p> 
Sut is a complex forerunner of later creations by <A HREF="atwain.htm">Twain</A> and William Faulkner.  Sut's role as a
fool was coupled with the straightforward insight into the depravity of human nature that is
necessary to satirize and critique society.  Harris' use of Sut as a political satirist lends much
insight into the mind of the South at a critical period in its history.  Harris' one book, <i>Sut
Lovingood: Yarns Spun by a "Nat'ral Born Durn'd Fool"</i> was reviewed by Mark Twain in
1867.  Harris died under mysterious conditions on a return trip from Lynchburg, Virginia while
attempting to retain a publisher for a second book.
