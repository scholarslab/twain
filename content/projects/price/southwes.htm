The call of the frontier is an inescapable beckoning throughout the history of humanity.  The
wealth of land and opportunity in America provided a perfect outlet for this wanderlust.  The
history of the Southwest is one of expansion into rough territory and life in a rural, uniquely
American landscape.  The main characters in the story are passed down to us through the words
and images of the Southwestern humorists.  These humorists were most often professionals--
doctors, lawyers, editors--who were writing as amateurs, often anonymously.  Utilizing their
experience, imagination and wit, these men created a legacy of characters which amused their
contemporaries while helping to shape the enduring myth of the frontier in America.
<p>
The heyday of Southwestern humor culminates in the period between the 1830's and the
beginning of the Civil War in 1861.  The Southwest to which these humorists refer is present day
Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri.  The genre that
developed originates from the politics and oral histories of a burgeoning region-- full of fire and
out to prove itself to the world.  This enthusiasm manifests itself in bawdy, violent, and
predominately masculine portrayals of the world of the Southwest.  Yet beneath the savagery of
the stories, there is an effort at realism and regional descriptions that had not been attempted
previously.
<p>
Humorists like Augustus B. Longstreet, George Washington Harris and Johnson Jones Hooper
(among others) were the forerunners of Mark Twain.  They created a place in literature for
American vernacular and regional caricatures with their overblown stereotypes of the
frontiersman and yeoman farmer.  Their work proved to be the fertile ground which allowed
Twain to flourish in his time.  This site is designed to provide an anthology of some of the best
known works of Southwestern humor and basic biographical information about the authors.  It
will also explore the means of publication as well as noting well known
character types (i.e. <a href="roarer.htm">ring-tailed roarer</a>, <a href="hunter.htm">mighty hunter</a>, <a href="confiden.htm">confidence man</a>, and <a href="fool.htm">durn'd fool</a>) which developed from these humorous sketches--all in the overarching scheme
of contextualizing Mark Twain by examining the literary movement which undoubtedly shaped
his success.
