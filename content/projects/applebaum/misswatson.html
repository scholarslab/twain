<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B>Miss Watson</B>, one of mother
figures in </FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">, is
the strict, old, obnoxious sister of Huck's main guardian, the Widow.
Joining in the mission to civilize Huck, she uses a much more severe
approach. Huck describes one of his encounters with her - "Her
sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had
just come to live with her, and took a set at me now, with a
spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and
then the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer.
Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson
would say,"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;" and "Don't
scrunch up like that, Huckleberry- set up strait;" and pretty soon
she would say,"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry- Why
don't you behave?"(3). She also tries to make him dress in a more
respectable way - "Well, I got a good going-over in the morning, from
old Miss Watson,on the account of my clothes;"(13). Her constant
nagging eventually leads to Huck wanting to runaway again, a
sentiment we begin to see when he complains -"Miss Watson she kept
pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome"(4).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">In addition to civilizing him, she
also attempts to instill religion. Unfortunately she loses her
credibility with Huck when she explains the benefits of praying -
"Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing
came of it. She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I
would get it. But it warn't so. I tried it"(13). Unable to see any
tangible benefits of religion, Huck cannot help but dismiss it. Where
the Widow tries to portray a benevolent view of religion to get Huck
to accept it, Miss Watson, in last resort attempt to regain her
credibility, uses scare tactics -"Sometimes the widow would take me
to one side and talk about Providence in a manner that would make my
mouth water; but maybe the next day Miss Watson would take hold and
knock it all down again"(14). Miss Watson tries to scare Huck into
believing by telling him about how he was going to Hell, or the "bad
place," unless he changed his ways. </FONT></P>

reformer and mother figure, she can be associated with the following
