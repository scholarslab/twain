<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B>Aunt Sally</B>, one of the
leading mother figures in </FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">, is
Tom Sawyer's gullible and lovable aunt. Aunt Sally, one of the few
mother figures who is actually married, and her husband Silas live
down the river from Hannible at Phelps. When we are first introduced
to Aunt Sally, she is already the victim of a trick, for Huck, who's
goal is to help Jim escape, visits her pretending to be her newphew
-Tom Sawyer. Aunt Sally cannot even recoqnize her own newphew and
</FONT><A HREF="images/HF5.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">welcomes
Huck with open arms</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"> -"She
grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands,
and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down
over"(278). When Tom arrives to help Huck, he pretends to be Sid,
another one of her newphews, and together they start stealing
supplies from the unsuspecting aunt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">To cover their theft up they play
all sorts of tricks and pranks on her including; taking items like
sheets, spoons, and pies away and putting them back again so she
thinks she is always miscounting things; letting snakes and

loose in house so she gets distracted, etc. At one point when Huck
pretends to find a </FONT><A HREF="images/HF7.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">lost
spoon</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">, Aunt Sally thinks
she has things figured out - "It's just as I suspected. So you had it
in your pocket all the time; and like as not you've got the other
things there, too. How'd it get there?"(315). Huck, however, plays
right into her hands and uses religion to appease her -"I was
studying over my text in Acts seventeen, before breakfast, and I
reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament
in..."(316). Huck realizes that if he associates himself with
religion he will be commended instead of punished and, consequently,
feigns religous enthusiasm.When Huck and Tom's shenanigans are
finally exposed, the last impression of Aunt Sally we are left with
is of a confused and bewildered person - "Aunt Sally she was one of
the most mixed-upest looking persons I ever did
see..."(359).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Despite her gulliblity, Huck
commends her for her motherly capacity - "And then when I went to
bed, she come up with me, and fetched her candle, and tucked me in,
and mothered me so good I felt mean and like I couldn't look her in
the face;"(349). In the end, Huck feels guilty that he took advantage
of her because her intentions were so good and she was so loving
towards him.</FONT></P>

figure and such a loving character, she can be associated with the
following real life figures:</FONT></P>
