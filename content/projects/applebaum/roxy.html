FACE="Palatino">, the leading mother figure in </FONT><U><FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="sources.html">Puddn'head
Wilson</A></FONT></U><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">, is the naive
yet manipulative mother of Thomas Driscoll. One the few actual
mothers in Twain's fiction, Roxy allows us to get a closer look
inside the nature of a mother son relationship. The plot of
</FONT><U><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Puddn'head
Wilson</FONT></U><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"> rests on the fact
that although "for all intents and purposes" Roxy was white, the law
dictated that her one sixteenth parts negro kept her a negro. The
same law resulted in her son receiving a similar fate. Infuriated by
the thought of her son growing up a slave and potentially being sold
down the river, Roxy secretly switched her son with her master's
since even he could not tell the difference. Ironically, the switch
placed her in the awkward position of raising her master's son as her
own and being a slave to her own child - who would grow up as Tom
Driscoll.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The first impression we are given
of Roxy is of a noble and loving figure. The narrator first
introduces her,"She was of majestic form and stature; her attitudes
were imposing and statuesque, and her gestures and movements
distinguished by a noble and stately grace"(64). The narrator
continues to describe her assumed nobility despite her actual servant
status, "She had an easy, independent carriage - when she was among
her own caste - and high and 'sassy' with all"(64). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">At first she appears as a hero,
who in a moment of passion, cleverly switches the babies to save her
own child from the fate of being sold down the river. Unfortunately,
the idea turns sour and she becomes the victim of her own naiveness.
Not only does her real son become the joke of the town, he also grows
up to be an unsympathetic master, who maliciously whips and beats
her. Her naivete next surfaces when she invests all her hard earned
money from working on the steamship in the bank and then the bank
"had gone to smash and carried her four hundred dollars with
it"(101). Although this financial blunder may indicate financial
unawareness more than ignorance, since even Clemens found himself in
similar financial dire straits, it does indicate a certain lack of
awareness nevertheless. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The final evidence to Roxy's
naiveness can be seen in the continual faith she shows in her son.
After losing all her money, she returns to Dawson's Landing counting
on the the good will of her son Thomas to help support her. Of
course, this naive assumption gets thrown back in her face when he
tells her to get out of his sight. Finally, she has to resort to
manipulation by threatening to expose his gambling debts to his uncle
and then, if necessary, his true identity as her slave son. Thomas
pleas to her motherly instincts not to expose him which,
surprisingly, leads her to volunteer to go back into slavery so he
can pay off his debts:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">"Ain't you my chile? En does you know
anything dat a mother won't do for her chile? Day ani't nothin' a
white mother won't do for her chile. Who made 'em so? De Lord done
it. En who made the niggers? Se Lord made'em. In de' inside, mother's
is all the same. De Lord he made'em so. I's gwyne to be sole into
slavery, en a year you's gwyne to buy yo'ole mammy free ag'in. I'll
show you how. Dat's de plan."(174)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Once again, her motherly impulses
to save her child from harm get in the way of common sense. Naively
trusting her son to buy her back after he takes care of his debt, he
betrays her and sells her down the river. Although Roxy's display of
unconditional love and sacrifice can be admired on one hand, it also
demonstrates a certain motherly blindness when it comes to judging
the character of her own son. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The most important dynamic of
motherly relationships which Roxy displays and that the others do not
is the element of control. Since the other mother figures we have
looked at are aunts, the nature of the control they exert on the boys
seems to be fairly limited. Although Roxy's control of her son is
also somewhat limited by her slavehood, the relationship between Roxy
and Tom is the closest thing to an unrestricted mother-son
relationship we have seen so far. When Roxy proclaims that,"You is
the low-downest orniest hound dat was ever pupp'd into dis worl' - en
I's 'sponsible for it!"(189) to Thomas, Roxy feels she has a certain
inalienable right to be brutally honest with him. In addition to
having this right, she also feels that she has the right to order him
around - "Now I'll tell you what you's gwyne do"(189). Where the
other mother figures use an arsenal of pleas and tears in their
attempts to control the boys, Roxy utilizes a unrestrained, no
nonsense, hard lined approach. This type of interaction, albeit
dysfunctional at times, could only exist in a genuine mother-son
relationship.</FONT></P>

mother figure, she can be associated with the following
