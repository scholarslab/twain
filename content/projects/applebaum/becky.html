<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B>Becky Thatcher</B>, the leading
lady in<B> </B></FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B><U>The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer</U></B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">,
is the wealthy young love interest of Tom Sawyer. Becky is first
introduced on the porch of her father Judge Thatcher's house. Placed
on figurative pedestal, the porch of a large white house, Becky
represents the unattainable aristocratic woman. Tom, who is not
considered the "model boy" in town, uses an array of tactics,
beginning with acrobatics, to court her - "He worshiped this new
angel with a furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him;
then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to show
off in all sorts of boyish ways in order to win her admiration"(20).
During the first encounter, Becky essentially plays hard to get and
walks back into the house, pretending not to notice him. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Later on, when they get to school,
Tom tries once again to win her favor by using his skills as an
</FONT><A HREF="images/TS8.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">artist</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">
and drawing a picture. The picture, consisting of just a house,
succeeds in sparking further interest and gains her undivided
attention. Becky asks him to add a picture of a man - "The artist
erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could
have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she
was satisfied with with the monster, and whispered: 'It's a beautiful
man - now make me coming along'"(55). Having successfully won her
over with his artistic skills, skills obviously not finely tuned just
yet, he proceeds to tell her he loves her and asks her to marry him -
"Now its all done , Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't
ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but
me, never never and forever. Will you?"(61). After he receives her
confirmation and goes on about the benefits of such an arrangement,
he blunders and tells her about how he had a similar arrangement with
another girl - Amy Lawrence. This infuriates </FONT><A HREF="images/TS9.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Becky</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">
to the point of tears, where she slaps away a mock ring and refuses
anymore attempts to assuage her. In return, Tom storms off to
participate in some adventures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Not being able to get Becky out of
his mind, he gets worried about the fact that Becky had stopped
coming to school. He starts loitering around her father's house and
discovers that she was sick - "She was ill. What if she were to die!
There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took interest in
war, or even piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing
but dreariness left"(92). Becky's illness results in a reappraisal of
his values.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">In an effort to regain her
attention, Tom once again tries "doing all the heroic things her can
conceive of" which included "Goin' on like an Indian, yelling,
laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at the risk of life
and limb, throwing hand springs, standing on his head"(97). Becky
remains unimpressed, turns her nose in the air and snides,"Mf! some
people think they're mighty smart - always showing off!"(97). In an
heir of dignity, Becky teaches Tom that boyish tricks will not work
and if he wants to win her, it will have to be with something more
serious. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Tom finally wins over Becky's
heart for good by, first, not telling on her for sneaking into the
teachers desk and looking at the </FONT><A HREF="images/TS11.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">anatomy
book</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"> and accidentally
tearing one of its pages, and, second and most importantly, for
taking the blame and getting whipped for it. In effect, Tom shows his
support for Becky's dangerous interest in books. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Finally, Tom hopes to impress
Becky with his treasure, "he had the good hopes of hearing Huck's
"maow," and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the
pic-nickers with, next day; but he was disappointed"(203). If this
quote is stretched a little, when Tom expresses his desire to impress
Becky and the pic-nickers with his potential treasure, he reveals his
capacity to provide for Becky and maintain her wealthy
status.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The relationship is sealed once
again in the cave when Tom presents Becky with the "</FONT><A HREF="images/TS4.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">wedding
cake</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">"(228). When the two
are at their most vulnerable, Tom is allowed to save the day for
Becky.... and they live happily ever after.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The correlations between Clemens's
courtship of Olivia and Tom's courtship of Becky are astounding.
Otherwise, aspects of all these real life figures can be seen some
way or another in Becky. </FONT></P>
