<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B>Clara Clemens </B>(1874-1962),
the middle daughter of Sam Clemens, was the preserver of the Mark
Twain persona and only daughter to survive her father. From the time
when she and her sisters were very young, they had always listened to
their father's works in progress, giving him instant feedback as he
went along, but as they got older she was forced out of the sacred
loop and out of favor with her father. Trombley, in her
</FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><U>Mark
Twain in the Company of Women</U></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">,
explains that her tumultuous relationship with her father eventually
resulted in her gaining a "villainous" reputation(16). She then goes
to explain that this reputation was essentially created by her
father's personal assistant Isabel Lyon, who swooned all over him and
referred to him as King, and that the two women did not get along.
Trombley conjectures on some of the sources of this unfavorable
relationship with Clemens:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">"In order to treat Clara and the obvious
alienation between her and Clemens fairly, one must examine the role
Clara was reduced to playing in the family drama. At the age of
thirty, with her mother and sister dead, Clara was assigned the
caretaker. Dealing with Clemens had never been easy for her mother, a
woman Clemens idolized, and now Clara had the task of trying to
fulfill her mother's role while her father still grieved his favorite
daughter's loss and openly claimed to hate the human race after the
the loss of his wife. It must must have been painfully clear to Clara
that her father's fondest thoughts were limited to her childhood. He
had no place for her as an adult."(Trombley 17)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">In addition, both her parents, Sam
and Olivia, were unsupportive of her singing career from the
beginning. When she was thirty-five, she married classical pianist
Ossip Gabrilowitsch and went to Europe, leaving her "ailing father
and epileptic sister" to fend for themselves. Criticism of this
relationship has been thrown in both directions but, nevertheless,
their relationship was not entirely damnable. Clemens tried to show
his love for Clara and Jean by firing Isabella Lyon(Trombley 181) and
Clara tried to show her love for him by "carefully preserving" her
father's image right up until her death in 1962(Trombley
5).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Since Clara's and Jean's roles
were mostly limited to being an audience member and source of
childhood inspiration while they were young, it is hard to pinpoint
exactly what kind of influence Clara had on any of the characters.
The only character she might share something with is Becky for the
time Clemens appeared to appreciate Clara the most was when she was a
young girl, a young girl like Becky. Otherwise, the connections are
slim and nebulous:</FONT></P>
