<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B>Jane Lampton Clemens</B>,
mother of Sam Clemens, was the playful, unpredictable, humorous
mother of Samuel Clemens. The primary roles she played in Clemens's
life were endowing him with a sense of humor and a love of play as
well as providing an attentive audience for his stories. At the age
of nineteen, she married the "somber and unaffectionate" John Clemens
to "spite another man"</FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">(Kaplan

was poor but proud of her gentry lineage. She gave birth to seven
children, with Samuel coming in sixth. Samuel Clemens describes his
mother best when he writes, "My mother was very much alive,
&#91;her&#93; age contented for nothing; fond of excitement, fond of
novelties, fond of anything going was of a sort proper for members of
the Church to indulge in..."</FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">(Trombley

was of a sunshine disposition, and her long life was mainly a holiday
for her. She always had the heart of a young girl. Through all of the
family troubles she maintained a kind of perky stoicism which was
lighted considerably by her love of gossip, gaudy spectacles like
parades and funerals, bright colors, and </FONT><A HREF="images/CYAN6.jpg"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">animals</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">"(Trombley

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">From all accounts, it was Clemens
father who provided the stern and disciplined upbringing. It appears
that Jane's influence can most probably be observed in the playful
and humorous characters in Twain's works - but these tend to be the
male protagonist. Nevertheless, if Jane had to be associated with
some female characters, it would most likely be with these characters
- for the sole reason that they are loving mother figures or women
who share some of the same characteristics:</FONT></P>
