<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Jean Clemens</FONT></B><FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"> (1880-1910), youngest daughter of Sam
Clemens, was the invalid of the family. Like her older sisters, she
provided Clemens with an audience and source of inspiration while she
was young. Unfortunately, she grew up to be a very sick woman,
suffering from epilepsy, and had to be placed in a sanatorium on
October 25, 1906, two years after Olivia's death. "Clemens was unable
to handle the enormity of Jean's affliction and, inappropriately,
thrust the responsibility on Isabella Lyon" -an assistant who swooned
all over him and affectionately called him "King" </FONT><FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="sources.html">(Trombley
16)</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">. Unlike his idealized
relationship with his oldest daughter Susy, Clemens had precarious
relationships with his other two daughters. The neglectful nature of
Clemens and Jean's relationship can be seen in her 1906 diary, when
she writes "Father can't possibly find any entertainment or interest
in me"(Trombley 19), and in her 1907 diary, when she "duly records
Clemens's infrequent visits"(Trombley 178). Nevertheless, it was not
an unloving relationship by any means. In an effort to show his love
for them, he fired Isabella Lyon -"By ousting Lyon, Clemens tried to
prove to Clara and Jean that he still loved them"(Trombley 181). Soon
after the dismissal, Jean was "reinstated" into the Clemens
household. Unfortunately, she died nearly a year after her return.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Since Jean's and Clara's roles
were mostly limited to being an audience member and source of
inspiration while they were young, it is hard to pinpoint exactly
what kind of influence Jean had on any of the characters. The only
character she might share something with is Becky, for the time
Clemens appeared to appreciate Jean the most was when she was a young
girl, a young girl like Becky. Otherwise, the connections are slim
and nebulous:</FONT></P>
