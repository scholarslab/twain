<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B>Widow Douglas</B>, the prime
mother figure in </FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Adventures
in Huckleberry Finn</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">, is
the strict, old, pious guardian of Huck Finn. Huck describes the
basic nature of their relationship -"The Widow Douglas, she took me
for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough
living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and
decent the widow was in all her ways; so when I couldn't stand it no
longer, I lit out. I got into my old rags, and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied"(1). In an attempt to further
"sivilize" Huck, she also tries to get Huck to quit his other bad
habits - "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let
me. But she wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't
clean, and I must try to not do it anymore"(3). The widow embodies
civilization and everything respectable but Huck's ideal is to escape
the traps of civilization. This ideal proves to be a difficult one to
live up to for even his best friend Tom applies pressure on him to
change - only allowing Huck to join his band of pirates if he "would
go back to the widow and be respectable"(2). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Part of the widow's overall design
is to instill Huck with religion. Huck recognizes the good intentions
on her behalf -"The widow, she cried over me, and called me a poor
lost lamb, and she called me lots of other names, too, but she never
meant no harm by it"(2) but he cannot bring himself to accept them.
She tries using the scripture to teach Huck about religion but to no
productive end -"After supper she got out her book and learned me
about Moses and the Bulrushers; and I was in a sweat to learn about
him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a
considerable long time; so then I didn't care about him, because I
don't take no stock in dead people"(2). When she tries to instill
good religious values - "I must help other people, and do everything
I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and
never think about myself"(13), Huck is unable to understand the logic
behind them. To Huck, everything about religion is illogical or
contradictory. He yearns to accept religion but somehow gets denied
every time -"Sometimes the widow would take me to one side and talk
about Providence in a manner that would make my mouth water; but
maybe the next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down
again"(14). Despite all of the widow's attempts, Huck never fully
accepts religion.</FONT></P>

reformer and mother figure, she can be associated with the following
