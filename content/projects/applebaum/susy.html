<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Olivia Susan Clemens
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">(1872-1896), oldest
daughter of Sam Clemens, was the undisputed favorite daughter of the
author. From the time when she and her sisters were very young, they
had always listened to their father's works in progress, giving him
instant feedback as he went along, but as they got older it was
Suzy's opinion which took precidence - "Just as Olivia had won the
role of Clemens's intitial muse, Susy evolved into the
second"</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"

SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"> and "it was clear Clemens regarded Susy as
his intellectual and social equal(Trombley 163). Like her mother, she
wanted her father to be taken seriously as a writer and not just as a
humorist. In a correspondence to Grace King, Susy expressed a
loathing of her father's title of humorist - "How I hate that
name!...My father should not be satisfied with it!...He should show
himself and the great writer that he is, not merely a funny man.
Funny! That's all the people see in him - a maker of funny
speeches"(Trombley 156). With this goal in mind, she became an even
more crucial participant in the editing and planning of her father's
works. Clemens found, in her, another "straitman" to help steer his
work in a more serious direction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Despite her criticism of him as a
humorist, she was still extremely fond of him. She began writing a
biography of him at the age of thirteen which eventually inspired
Twain to write his own autobiograhy(Trombley173). One of her most
significant roles, however, ended up being a fertile source of
inspiration. "Clemens openly admitted: "Suzy at 17, Joan of Arc at
17. Secretly, I drew Joan's physical portrait from Suzy at that age,
when I came to write that book. Apart from that, I had no formally
appointed model for Joan but her own historical self. Yet there were
several points of resemblence between the girls; such as vivacity,
enthusiasm, precocious wisdom, wit, elegance, penetration, nobility
of character"(Trombley 158). When she died from meningitis at the age
of 24, Clemens was devastated. He lost much of his inspiration.
Critics seem to agree that Susy's death marks the end of his most
sucessfull period of work - "DeVoto attributes the difficulties
Clemens had in his fiction, beginning in 1890, to a "series of
catastrophes," with Susy's demise taking prominence"(Trombley165).

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Although the character Joan of Arc
will obviously have the most similarities to Susy, her influence can
be seen in all these characters, particularly the reform based
ones:</FONT></P>
