<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino"><B>Aunt Polly</B>, the leading
mother figure in </FONT><A HREF="sources.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">,
is the naive, reformist, yet loving aunt of Tom Sawyer. The first
glance of Aunt Polly's naiveness and gullibility occurs when the
narrator reveals that she thinks she has the capacity to covertly
manipulate the actions of others -"Like many other simple hearted
souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent
for dark and mysterious diplomacy"(4). As the story continues, we see
that the situation is actually opposite and it is more that she is
the victim of Tom's manipulations instead. Aunt Sally also reveals
her naiveness in her misguided attempts at health care - "She was one
of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new
fangled methods of producing health or mending it"(92). Instead of
healing Tom, she would just intoxicate him to the point where he
would be having a drug induced "general good time," and
"lay&#91;ing&#93; on the floor expiring with laughter"(95). Aunt
Polly would also experiment with hydrotherapy, "drowning him in a
deluge of cold water" for "The water treatment was new, now, and
Tom's low condition was a windfall to her"(93). The narrator explains
Aunt Polly's futile efforts at healing -"She was as simple hearted
and honest as the day went along, and so she was an easy
victim"(93).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The first impression we get of
Aunt Polly is that of a disciplinarian. The novel begins with Aunt
Polly threatening Tom -"Forty times I've said if you don't let that
jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch"(2) and continues with
pledges to control him -"I'll just be obliged to make him work,
tomorrow, I'll punish him"(3). Tom constantly finds himself in
trouble and creates such a reputation for himself that he gets
accused for crimes he does not even commit. When his cousin Sid
breaks the sugar bowl, the first thing Aunt Polly does when she finds
out is turn to Tom and scold him for it. When she finds out, she
feels remorse but realizes she cannot show it for she must maintain
her role as disciplinarian - "Then her conscious reproached her, and
she yearned to say something kind of loving, but she judged that this
would be construed into a confession that she had been wrong; and
discipline forbade that"(22). When she believes Tom is dead, she
thinks she might have even carried her role of disciplinarian a
little to far -"And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with a
thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles
now. And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach-"(116).

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">In addition to providing
discipline, Aunt Polly also attempts to provide spiritual guidance.
In an effort to explain her difficulty in raising Tom she justifies
-"Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of a few days and full of
trouble, as the scripture says, and I reckon it's so"(3). Using the
Bible, she comes to the unfeminist conclusion that Tom's evil
behavior originates in being born to a woman and that it is her duty
to fix it. She further reinforces religious values in Tom with a
small lesson which references the Edenic apple -"She was so overcome
by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet
and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with a
lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when
it came without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed
with a happy Scriptural flourish, he "hooked" a doughnut"(18). By
giving him an apple for doing something good, she tries to show that
a fruit usually associated with sin will taste a lot better if it is
associated with virtue. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">The final and most important role
we see Aunt Polly take is that of a loving mother figure. Despite the
relentless discipline and spiritual guidance, she comes off as a
caring and noble character. When Tom points out that nobody seems to
care about Huck being alive after they were both thought to be dead,
Aunt Polly generously gives her love to Huck as well -"And so they
shall.I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!" and the loving
attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of
making him more uncomfortable than he was before"(131). In fact, the
last impression we get of Aunt Polly is of a similar nature - "There
was something about aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that
swept away his low spirits and made him light hearted and happy
again"(147). </FONT></P>

mother figure and reformer, she can be associated with the following
