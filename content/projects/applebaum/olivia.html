<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Olivia Langdon </FONT></B><FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">(1845-1904), wife of Sam Clemens, was born
to a wealthy, abolitionist family in Elmira, New York. She was
considered to be frail in health - "It is likely that Clemens was
informed early on by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Langdon about the supreme
delicacy of Olivia's health" </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="sources.html">(Trombley 95)</A></FONT><FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">. The Langdons experimented with a variety
of health treatments to aid Olivia; including sending her to Gleason
Water Cure to receive hydrotherapy. Although lacking in physical
prowess, she proved to be a bastion of moral and intellectual
strength. She was raised in a stimulating environment, constantly
being exposed to some of the most exciting issues and people of her
day - "Throughout her life, Olivia was close to women who were
dynamic, intelligent, unapologetic, as well as committed feminists -
women who had rejected the purely domestic sphere in favor of
participation of the outside world"(Trombley 131). Through being in
contact with such people as </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1"

an identity as a reformist - committed to such causes as temperance,
abolition, and women's suffrage.</FONT></P>

stateroom aboard the Quaker City, the voyage on which Clemens
recorded for </FONT><U><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Innocents
Abroad</FONT></U><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">. Soon after his
return, he visited the Langdons and less than two weeks after that,
he was in love and proposed to her. She rejected his offer at first
but after a couple years and a couple hundred letters, they were
finally engaged. During this courtship, Clemens made some remarkable
reformations - "Livy disapproved of drinking, smoking, Western
manners, and even humorists, and he courted her by offering, in all
sincerity, to make over his character and his habits to meet her
desires. For a while, he came close to religious orthodoxy, prayed,
and went to church..."</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="sources.html">(Kaplan 82)</A></FONT><FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">. To Olivia's dismay and continual
frustration, these efforts to reform himself curbed off after his
courtship, and he reverted back to some of his old habits and
religious unorthodoxy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Nevertheless, Olivia's moral
influence and literary experience played a large part in the
popularity of his collective works. "When Clemens was introduced to
her on December 31, 1867, he met a woman far better educated than he
was"(Trombley 46). With her help, Twain's work became increasingly
accessible to a female audience, a necessity for being a popular
writer in his day. He wanted </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Palatino">an equal </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Palatino">for "he would not marry until he could maintain his
wife 'in the position which I designed her for, viz; - as a
companion. I don't want to sleep with a threefold being who is a
cook, chambermaid, and washer woman all in one'"(Trombley 43). In
other words, he did not want the stereotypical women of his times -
subservient, domestic, etc. This position revealed itself in Clemens
asking her to proofread and edit all his manuscripts. Where Clemens
was the raunchy, unpolished, and humorous half of the team, Olivia
was the "strait" half, who encouraged Clemens to take a serious
approach to his works - "I never wrote a serious word until after I
married Mrs. Clemens. She is solely responsible - to her should go
the credit - for any influence my subsequent work should exert. After
my marriage, she edited everything I wrote"(Trombley 168). Even
though he joked about being "henpecked," or "whipped" as we would
say, most of his respected works were created during his marriage
with Olivia (Kaplan 82).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Palatino">Filling roles in both Romantic and
Reformist areas of Clemens's life, her influence can be seen fairly
easily in all these characters:</FONT></P>
