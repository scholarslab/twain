<h2><center><b><i>Cooper and Romanticism</i></b></center></h2>
<p>
Romanticism as an American literary movement occurred between 1790-1870, reacting against neoclassic literary conventions.  Characteristics of Romantic literature include (Barker 18):
<ul>
<li>emphasis on testing an individual's spirit</li>
<li>nature as an elemental force</li>
<li>rise and fall of nations</li>
<li>strict stratification of society (Men>Women, Whites>Indians, Indians>Blacks)</li>
<li>importance of heroes and heroic deeds</li>
<li>interest in folk culture and ethnic cultural origins</li>
</ul>

<p>
In <i>The Lasting of the Mohicans</i> Barker illustrates the importance of Romanticism in Cooper's work:
<blockquote>
Romanticism was more than just an influence on Cooper's work; it was a direct spur.  Cooper was part of an identifiable group of writers, artists, and intellectuals, based in New York, who saw it as their mission to foster a broadly Romantic version of America.  They took poet Ralph Waldo Emerson's then-famous words, "[America has] arts to acquire, and tastes to form," as a challenge, and openly discussed the creation of an "indigenous culture" at various select clubs and gatherings. (18)
