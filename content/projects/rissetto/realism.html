<h2><center><i><b>Twain and Progressivist Realism</b></i></center></h2>
<p>
Realism and Modernism spanned from 1870-1940, of which Mark Twain belonged to the former. Twain stringently reacted against the Sir Walter Scott <a href="romance.html">Romanticism</a> that was popular in the early nineteenth century. In <i>The Last of the Mohicans: Civil Savagery and Savage Civility</i>, John McWilliams delineates characteristics of these genres:
<p>
<blockquote>
Realists like Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, and Stephen Crane, and Modernists like Ernest Hemingway and Sherwood Anderson, demanded short, simple words, accuracy of description, and natural spoken dialogue.  they regarded plots based on suspense, adventure, horror or withheld information as at best distracting and at worst so silly as to seem incredible.  Characters should resemble "real people" who speak ordinary language in everyday circumstances; nothing suspiciously sensational should ever happen to them.  Concision, brevity, and unstated irony should become the writer's desired goals.  Instead of judging characters, novelists were asked to render them with such dramatic immediacy that the writer would seem to recede entirely from the imagined world he or she was creating.  Elaborate descriptions with lots of adjectives were out. Throw away the fancy five dollar word (<i>engender</i>) and find the nickel word that does the job better (<i>make</i>).
