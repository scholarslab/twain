"We
had a faithful and affectionate good friend, ally and advisor, in
'Uncle Dan'l', a middle-aged slave whose head was the best one in the
Negro quarter, whose sympathies were wide and warm and whose heart was
honest and simple and knew no guile. He has served me well these many,
many years. I have not seen him for more than half a century and yet
spiritually I have had his welcome company a good part of that time and
have staged him in books under his own name and as 'Jim' and carted him
all around--to Hannibal, down the Mississippi on a raft and even across
the desert of Sahara in a balloon." <span

"'Huckleberry Finn' was
Tom Blankenship...Tom's father was at one time Town Drunkard...In <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Huckleberry Finn</span> I have
drawn Tom Blankenship exactly as he was. He was
ignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed; but he had as good a heart as
ever any boy had. His liberties were totally unrestricted. He was the
only real independent person--boy or man--in the community, and by
consequence he was tranquilly and continually happy and was envied by
all the rest of us. We liked him; we enjoyed his society. And as
his society was forbidden us by our parents the prohibition trebled and
quadrupled its value, and therefore we sought and got more of his
society than of any other boy's. I heard, four years ago, that he was a
justice of the peace in a remote village in Montana and was a good
citizen and greatly respected." </span><span

"Darnell &amp; Watson were the names of two men whose
families had kept
up a long quarrel. The old man Darnell &amp; his 2 sons came to the
conclusion to leave that part of the country. They started to take
steamboat just above 'No. 10'. The Watsons got wind of it and as the
young Darnells were walking up the companion way stairs with their
wives on their arms they shot them in the back...One of these families
lived on the Kentucky side, the other on the Missouri side near New
Madrid. Once a boy 12 years old connected with the Kentucky family was
riding thro the woods on the Mo. side. He was overtaken by a full grown
man and he shot that boy dead...shortly afterwards there was another
row at that place and a youth of 19 belonging to the Mo. tribe had
wandered over there. Half a dozen of the Ky. tribe got after him. He
dodged among the wood piles &amp; answered their shots. Presently he
jumped in the river &amp; they followed on after him &amp; peppered him
&amp; he had to make for the shore. By that time he was about dead--did
shortly die...They used to attend church on the line...Both Darnell
&amp; Watson went to that church armed with shot guns, &amp; neither
party would allow the other to cross the line in that church."</small><small
