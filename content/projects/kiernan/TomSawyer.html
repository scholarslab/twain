"My mother had a good
deal of trouble with me but I think she enjoyed it. She had none at all
with my brother Henry, who was two years younger than I, and I think
that the unbroken monotony of his goodness and truthfulness and
obedience would have been a burden to her but for the relief I
furnished in the other direction...I never knew Henry to do a vicious
thing toward me or anyone else--but he frequently did rightous ones
that cost me as heavily. It was his duty to report me, when I needed
reporting and neglected to do it myself, and he was very faithful in
discharging that duty. He is Sid in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tom
Sawyer</span>. But Sid was not Henry.
Henry was a very much finer and better boy than ever Sid was." </span><span

story &amp; didn't take the chap beyond boyhood. I believe it would be
fatal to do it in any shape but autobiographically...I perhaps made a
mistake in not writing it in the first person. If I went on, now, &amp;
took him into manhood, he would just be like all the one-horse men in
literature &amp; the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him.
It is not a boy's book, after all. It will only be read by adults. It
is only written for adults...By &amp; by I shall take a boy of twelve

Sawyer--he would not be a good character for it."</small><small

"I simply hunted out the pencil marks &amp; made the
emendations which they suggested. I reduced the boy-battle to a curt
paragraph; I finally concluded to cut the Sunday-school speech down to
the first two sentences, leaving no suggestion of satire, since the
book is to be for the boys &amp; girls. I tamed the various obscenities
until I judged that they no longer carried offense."<span
