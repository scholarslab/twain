"In her loss I am almost bankrupt, and my life is a bitterness, but I
am content: for she has been enriched with <br>
the most precious of all gifts--that gift which makes all other gifts
mean and poor--death. I have never wanted <br>
any released friend of mine restored to life since I reached manhood. I
felt this way when Susy passed away; <br>
and later my wife, and later Mr. Rogers. When Clara met me at the
station in New York and told me Mr. Rogers <br>
had died suddenly that morning, my thought was, Oh, favorite of
fortune--fortunate all his long and lovely life--<br>
fortunate to his latest moment! The reporters said there were tears of
sorrow in my eyes. True--but they were for <span
 style="font-style: italic;"><br>
me</span>, not for him. He had suffered no loss. All the fortunes he
had ever made before were poverty compared with <br>
this one." </span><span
