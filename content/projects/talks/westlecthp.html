<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; For the lecture I'm giving I want you to read and study a set of texts and illustrations from the <font size=-1>ROUGHING IT</font> section of my website <a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu"><font size=-1><b>MARK TWAIN IN HIS TIMES: AN ELECTRONIC ARCHIVE</a></b></font>.  These materials are all organized around the idea of <b>Mapping the West in Words & Pictures</b>.  Some of the words are Twain's, but the selections you'll be reading locate his images of the "west" in <i>Roughing It</i> in the context of a representative sampling of what other contemporary Americans said and saw.<br><br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; Start by  <a href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/roughingit/map/rimaphp.html"><font size=-1><b>CLICKING HERE</a></b></font> -- that will take you to the map homepage.  After reading that, go to the map and click on each of these categories: <b>1. Buffalo</b>, <b>4. South Pass</b>, <b>6. Native Americans</b>, and <b>11. Yosemite</b>.  What you'll come to are the texts and illustrations I want you to study; these are listed under <font size=-1><b>OTHER ACCOUNTS</b></font> and <font size=-1><b>MT'S ACCOUNT</b></font>.  It may look like a lot to read, but the textual selections are mostly short.  I know you'll be willing to look at the pictures, but I want you to "read" them too: think just as hard about what image or idea of the "west" they depict.<br><br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm looking forward to meeting with you on Thursday.  Stephen Railton<br><br>
