      <H2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Constantinople</H2><BR>
      <P>Ashore, it was -- well, it was an eternal circus. People were thicker
      than bees, in those narrow streets, and the men were dressed in all the
      outrageous, outlandish, idolatrous, extravagant, thunder-and-lightning
      costumes that ever a tailor with the delirium tremens and seven devils
      could conceive of. There was no freak in dress too crazy to be indulged
      in; no absurdity too absurd to be tolerated; no frenzy in ragged diabolism
      too fantastic to be attempted. No two men were dressed alike. It was a
      wild masquerade of all imaginable costumes -- every struggling throng in
      every street was a dissolving view of stunning contrasts. Some patriarchs
      wore awful turbans, but the grand mass of the infidel horde wore the fiery
      red skull-cap they call a fez. All the remainder of the raiment they
      indulged in was utterly indescribable.</P>
      <P>The shops here are mere coops, mere boxes, bath-rooms, closets -- any
      thing you please to call them -- on the first floor. The Turks sit
      cross-legged in them, and work and trade and smoke long pipes, and smell
      like -- like Turks. That covers the ground. Crowding the narrow streets in
      front of them are beggars, who beg forever, yet never collect any thing;
      and wonderful cripples, distorted out of all semblance of humanity,
      almost; vagabonds driving laden asses; porters carrying drygoods boxes as
      large as cottages on their backs; peddlers of grapes, hot corn, pumpkin
      seeds, and a hundred other things, yelling like fiends; and sleeping
      happily, comfortably, serenely, among the hurrying feet, are the famed
      dogs of Constantinople; drifting noiselessly about are squads of Turkish
      women, draped from chin to feet in flowing robes, and with snowy veils
      bound about their heads, that disclose only the eyes and a vague, shadowy
      notion of their features. Seen moving about, far away in the dim, arched
      aisles of the Great Bazaar, they look as the shrouded dead must have
      looked when they walked forth from their graves amid the storms and
      thunders and earthquakes that burst upon Calvary that awful night of the
      Crucifixion. A street in Constantinople is a picture which one ought to
      see once -- not oftener.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><A
