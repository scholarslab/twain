      <H2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Odessa</H2><BR>
      <P>I have not felt so much at home for a long time as I did when I
      ''raised the hill" and stood in Odessa for the first time. It looked just
      like an American city; fine, broad streets, and straight as well; low
      houses, (two or three stories,) wide, neat, and free from any quaintness
      of architectural ornamentation; locust trees bordering the sidewalks (they
      call them acacias;) a stirring, business-look about the streets and the
      stores; fast walkers; a familiar <I>new</I> look about the houses and
      every thing; yea, and a driving and smothering cloud of dust that was so
      like a message from our own dear native land that we could hardly refrain
      from shedding a few grateful tears and execrations in the old time-honored
      American way. Look up the street or down the street, this way or that way,
      we saw only America! There was not one thing to remind us that we were in
      Russia. We walked for some little distance, reveling in this home vision,
      and then we came upon a church and a hack-driver, and presto! the illusion
      vanished! The church had a slender-spired dome that rounded inward at its
      base, and looked like a turnip turned upside down, and the hackman seemed
      to be dressed in a long petticoat without any hoops. These things were
      essentially foreign, and so were the carriages--but every body knows about
      these things, and there is no occasion for my describing them. </P>
      <P>We were only to stay here a day and a night and take in coal; we
      consulted the guide-books and were rejoiced to know that there were no
      sights in Odessa to see; and so we had one good, untrammeled holyday on
      our hands, with nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoy ourselves.
      We sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearful and wonderful
      costumes from the back country; examined the populace as far as eyes could
      do it; and closed the entertainment with an ice-cream debauch. We do not
      get ice-cream every where, and so, when we do, we are apt to dissipate to
      excess. We never cared any thing about ice-cream at home, but we look upon
      it with a sort of idolatry now that it is so scarce in these red-hot
      climates of the East.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><A
