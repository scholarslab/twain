      <H2>&nbsp; &nbsp; Magdala</H2><BR>
      <P>M<FONT size=-1>AGDALA</FONT> is not a beautiful place. It is thoroughly
      Syrian, and that is to say that it is thoroughly ugly, and cramped,
      squalid, uncomfortable, and filthy--just the style of cities that have
      adorned the country since Adam's time, as all writers have labored hard to
      prove, and have succeeded. The streets of Magdala are any where from three
      to six feet wide, and reeking with uncleanliness. The houses are from five
      to seven feet high, and all built upon one arbitrary plan--the ungraceful
      form of a dry-goods box. The sides are daubed with a smooth white plaster,
      and tastefully frescoed aloft and alow with disks of camel-dung placed
      there to dry. This gives the edifice the romantic appearance of having
      been riddled with cannon-balls, and imparts to it a very warlike aspect.
      When the artist has arranged his materials with an eye to just
      proportion--the small and the large flakes in alternate rows, and
      separated by carefully-considered intervals--I know of nothing more
      cheerful to look upon than a spirited Syrian fresco. The flat, plastered
      roof is garnished by picturesque stacks of fresco materials, which, having
      become thoroughly dried and cured, are placed there where it will be
      convenient. It is used for fuel. There is no timber of any consequence in
      Palestine--none at all to waste upon fires--and neither are there any
      mines of coal. If my description has been intelligible, you will perceive,
      now, that a square, flat-roofed hovel, neatly frescoed, with its wall-tops
      gallantly bastioned and turreted with dried camel-refuse, gives to a
      landscape a feature that is exceedingly festive and picturesque,
      especially if one is careful to remember to stick in a cat wherever, about
      the premises, there is room for a cat to sit. There are no windows to a
      Syrian hut, and no chimneys. When I used to read that they let a
      bed-ridden man down through the roof of a house in Capernaum to get him
      into the presence of the Saviour, I generally had a three-story brick in
      my mind, and marveled that they did not break his neck with the strange
      experiment. I perceive now, however, that they might have taken him by the
      heels and thrown him clear over the house without discommoding him very
      much. Palestine is not changed any since those days, in manners, customs,
      architecture, or people.</P>
      <P>As we rode into Magdala not a soul was visible. But the ring of the
      horses' hoofs roused the stupid population, and they all came trooping
      out--old men and old women, boys and girls, the blind, the crazy, and the
      crippled, all in ragged, soiled and scanty raiment, and all abject beggars
      by nature, instinct and education. How the vermin-tortured vagabonds did
      swarm! How they showed their scars and sores, and piteously pointed to
      their maimed and crooked limbs, and begged with their pleading eyes for
      charity! We had invoked a spirit we could not lay. They hung to the
      horses's tails, clung to their manes and the stirrups, closed in on every
      aide in scorn of dangerous hoofs--and out of their infidel throats, with
      one accord, burst an agonizing and most infernal chorus: "Howajji,
      bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! bucksheesh!
      bucksheesh!" I never was in a storm like that
before.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><A
