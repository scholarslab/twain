    <TD>This interpretive archive, drawn largely from the resources of the
      Barrett Collection, focuses on how "Mark Twain" and his works were created
      and defined, marketed and performed, reviewed and appreciated. The goal is
      to allow readers, scholars, students and teachers to see what Mark Twain
      and His Times said about each other, in a way that can speak to us today.
      Contained here are dozens of texts and manuscripts, scores of contemporary
      reviews and articles, hundreds of images, and many different kinds of
      interactive exhibits. For a quick overview, you can go to "Sample This
      Site." If you'd like help navigating the site, start with "Piloting
      Lessons" in "About This Site."</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>
