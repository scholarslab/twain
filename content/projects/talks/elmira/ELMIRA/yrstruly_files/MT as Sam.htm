<P>MT used this signature on his letters to his mother, his brother Orion, 
Orion's wife Mollie, and other members of the family he grew up in. As far as I 
can tell, he didn't use it on letters to anyone else. The letter below is 
written in the spring of 1867. His career as MT is beginning to take off (the 
book he refers to is the collection of sketches published by Henry Webb as 
<I>The Celebrated Jumping Frog</I>); he himself is getting ready to take off as 
well, on the <I>Quaker City</I> expedition that led to <I>Innocents 
Abroad</I>.</P><A
