<p>MT used this signature on his letters to his mother, his brother Orion, Orion's wife Mollie, and
other members of the family he grew up in.  As far as I can tell, he didn't use it on letters to
anyone else.  The letter below is written in the spring of 1867.  His career as MT is beginning to
take off (the book he refers to is the collection of sketches published by Henry Webb as <i>The
Celebrated Jumping Frog</i>); he himself is getting ready to take off as well, on the <i>Quaker
City</i> expedition that led to <i>Innocents Abroad</i>.</p>
