      <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; Admirers of Mark Twain were collecting his books and
      autographs during his lifetime, and after the 1911 auction of several
      hundred books from his library, the popularity of collecting of relics
      associated with Twain also grew. Most of these collectors were drawn to
      Twain because of his writings, and most of their collecting interest
      focused on his writings and things directly associated with his literary
      works.<BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; But Twain's influence has not been limited to
      his career as a writer. His status as a celebrity had a profound cultural
      impact during his lifetime and his popular image has evolved ever since.
      Many people don't know Twain through his writings, but instead have a
      notion of his place in American cultural life based solely on his image
      and perhaps a few dubious quotations. Twain's name and image were used in
      the market place from the very beginnings of his literary career in the
      1860s until his death in 1910, sometimes with his permission, and much
      more often without his knowledge. And after his death, his name and image
      were used to promote products and causes in new and even more distorted
      ways. <BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; The relics pictured here were selected from a
      large collection and represent just a small portion of the surviving
      objects that reflect the commercial use of Twain's name and image during
      his lifetime and after. The emphasis of this collection is on materials
      from Twain's lifetime, and includes far less material from the first
      twenty-five years after his death, and even fewer items after the 1935
      centennial of his birth. But make no mistake: the use (and cultural
      evolution) of Twain's name and image continues unabated today.<BR><BR>

      copyright reform. It carried the facsimile signatures of Twain, Louisa May
      Alcott, Sarah Orne Jewett, Joel Chandler Harris, W. D. Howells, Whittier,
      Holmes, and a host of other authors. The large broadside was issued in
      Hartford in 1871 and used Twain's name. Badly written, there is no
      internal evidence of Twain's having anything to do with it, and it is not

      &nbsp; This dust pan, crumb sweeper (known as a silent butler), and tray
      were issued on January 1, 1901 for members of the Mark Twain Club. The
      earliest known Mark Twain Club had been established in Ireland in 1875,
      and another in New York (possibly the club that issued this set) consisted
      of thirty-two members, including twelve women. Unlike modern fan clubs,
      these clubs were reading clubs that read and discussed Twain's works.

      dates from the publication of LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI. The bill of lading
      is from the steamboat mail packet Mark Twain that operated out of Memphis
      and dates from April 23, 1882. Sometime between May 6 and 21, 1882, Twain
      himself saw this very steamboat as he floated down the Mississippi toward
      New Orleans, and in the opening lines of chapter 28 of LIFE ON THE
      MISSISSIPPI he expressed surprise at the honor of having a steamboat named
      after him, but could not help but add that he thought the honor was long
      overdue. The plate dates from 1935, and the postcards (1902-1912) show the
      steamboat rechristened in Twain's honor in 1902 when he visited St. Louis;
      Twain himself piloted that steamboat around the harbor. </TD></TR>

      country have called themselves "The Mark Twain Hotel." The first one was
      in Hannibal, and it comes as no surprise to find such hotels in St. Louis
      and Elmira, but these matchbook covers, dating from 1920 to 1950, include
      Mark Twain Hotels from Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Gainesville, and
      even Hollywood. The 1889 advertising brochure for the Ontario Beach resort
      contains a letter supposedly written by Twain extolling their virtues.
      Places that Twain visited often used his name to promote themselves, but
      so did hotels and resorts where he never set foot. </TD></TR>

      &nbsp; During his lifetime Twain was plagued by people who traveled around
      the country impersonating him. Some did this as a fraud and left their
      hotel bills unpaid. Others were legitimate impersonators -- proto-Hal
      Holbrooks. As these two broadside advertising sheets attest, Twain was in
      good company. These programs included readings from Twain, Shakespeare,
      Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charles Dickens, Tennyson, and Walter Scott. The
      larger one dates from 1876, and the other is of the same period. </TD></TR>

      (Twain's own lecture agent) gave Twain's advice to would-be lecturers.

      wrote a letter praising the bravery of a Cunard Line crew that saved
      people from a storm-tossed steamer in 1872, and in 1873 they reprinted his
      letter in their promotional leaflet. In 1896 the North German Lloyd Line
