      <P>With the help of computer technology <A
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/innocent/webmap.htm">this
      map</A> attempts to display two different things. First, the route MT took
      on the <I>Quaker City</I> excursion -- which you can follow by scrolling
      along the red line. At the same time, the 13 places named <B>in yellow</B>
      are active links. Clicking on any of them will take you to a passage in
      <I>Innocents Abroad</I> about that place. And when MT's book is
      reconceived this way -- geographically, or geo-culturally -- what begins
      to appear is a map of the racial and ethnic prejudices shared by the book
      and its American audience.</P>
      <P>The lines in this ideological map aren't always clearly drawn.
      <I>Innocents Abroad</I> is rhetorically opportunistic rather than
      thematically coherent. MT's perspective often switches around, and
      whenever his point-of-view changes so does the site he's looking at. He
      offers a graphic description, for example, of <A
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/innocent/venxday.html">Venice
      by day</A>; a few minutes and paragraphs later, however, and <A
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/innocent/venxnite.html">Venice
      by night</A> is a different place altogether. He finds things to mock and
      to admire almost everywhere he goes.</P>
      <P>But as you'll see by comparing what he writes about northern locales
      like Paris and Odessa with what he writes about Mediterranean Europe, or
      comparing any of these passages with the way he describes non-white and
      non-Christian peoples in Africa and Asia, many of the variations in the
      narrative's tone can be linked directly to racial preconceptions. (A good
      instance of this is the way his nose comes increasingly into play as
      people's skins get darker; after only a brief time in Constantinople, for
      example, he can talk without irony about what Turks "smell like.")</P>
      <P>Some of the links -- Jerusalem and the Sphinx, in particular -- are to
      the passages that MT's contemporary readers seem to have enjoyed the most.
      But most of the others were picked to display the pattern of the book's
      preconceptions. Some fans of MT may decide that what this map chiefly
      exposes is my own biased reading of the text, but I've tried to be fair.
      You can check to see how fairly I've chosen by clicking on the graphic of
      the "Siamese twins" at the bottom right of each "page"; that will take you
      to the whole chapter from which the passage comes. (Clicking on the icon
      of the map at the bottom left will bring you back to the map.)</P>
      <P><I>Innocents Abroad</I> was the most popular travel book of MT's times.
      Its irreverent humor, its blithe assertion of America's readiness to take
      on the world, even (as the advertising would put it) its length and its
      lavish illustrations -- all these were major reasons for its extraordinary
      appeal to American readers. At the same time, the book's way of looking at
      Europe, Africa and Asia add up to a tour of the ideological world inside
      many of MT's contemporaries' heads.</P>
