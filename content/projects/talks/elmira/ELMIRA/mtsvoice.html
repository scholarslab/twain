      <P>Most of the newspaper reporters who covered MT's live performances 
      commented on his "inimitable" or "unmistakable" voice. Early in his career 
      a very few thought it was distracting, but the rest found it an 
      irresistible and vital part of the humorous spell that he cast over his 
      audiences. Reviewers usually referred to it as a "drawl," and emphasized 
      the slowness of MT's delivery. According to one (who had his own flair for 
      tall tales) he spoke at the rate of three words a minute.</P>
      <P>Sam Clemens may have been embarrassed about his way of talking. To 
      torment the autobiographical narrator of "Facts Concerning the Recent 
      Carnival of Crime in Connecticut," for example, Conscience speaks to him 
      in "an exasperating drawl" -- "there is nothing I am quite so sensitive 
      about," admits that narrator, "as a mocking imitation of my drawling 
      infirmity of speech." As Mark Twain the humorist, however, Clemens could 
      use that voice, even exaggerating its "infirmities," to keep audiences in 
      a receptive mood.</P>
      <P>I wish we could hear it. In the 1860s all we would have needed was 25 
      or 35 cents (with no extra charge for reserved seats) to listen to one of 
      MT's lectures. Even in the mid-1890s, it would only have taken 75 cents or 
      a dollar. To MT himself, the relationship between a live speech and the 
      written transcript of it was about the same as the relationship between a 
      live person and a corpse. But thanks to the help of several of the modern 
      performers who've perfected careful and loving imitations of it, you can 
      at least get some good ideas about what MT's voice sounded like.</P>
      <P>The sound files below are available in two formats, WAVE and Real 
      Audio. Most browsers are already equipped to play "wav" files; clicking 
      <B>the black and white icon</B> will download files formatted for WAVE. If 
      you have a Real Audio player, you can click on <B>the red and white

      <P>First, the work of <A

      has performed "Mark Twain" in almost as many places around the world as 
      Sam Clemens did, and was featured as MT on A&amp;E's <I>Biography</I>, and 
      the Discovery Channel's documentary on <I>Adventures of Huckleberry 
      Finn</I>.<BR><BR>
