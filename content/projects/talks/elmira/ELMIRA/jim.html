      <H2>Representing Jim, 1885-1985</H2></CENTER>
      <P>"Who dah?" This is Jim's first line, which is also the novel's first 
      line of dialogue. It's a good question for Jim to ask. One of the greatest 
      issues raised by the novel is "who is there" as far as Jim is concerned -- 
      a human being? a piece of property? What makes Huck decide to "go to hell" 
      in the scene that most critics call the moral climax of the story is that 
      he can "see Jim before me," instead of the figure his culture has told him 
      is there: "Miss Watson's nigger." But how the novel as a whole "sees" him 
      is a question that remains very controversial.</P>
      <P>As a perennially popular text, <I>Huck Finn</I> has appeared in 
      numerous editions, many of them illustrated. Every illustrator must "see 
      Jim" in order to draw him, and at the same time their various 
      illustrations together say a lot about the way that American book-makers 
      and book-buyers have imagined the African American slave.</P>
      <P>In this section I've gathered examples from every artist between 1885 
      to 1985 who depicted "Jim" for an American edition of the novel. I think 
      the pictures below tell a story -- about the persistence of racist 
      stereotypes and the slow emergence of the conviction that Jim is a 
      character whose humanity is the equal of Huck's or, say, Col. 
      Grangerford's -- but I've tried not to impose my reading too narrowly on 
      these selections. Whenever there were more than two pictures of "Jim," 
      I've tried to choose complementary ones: i.e. to include the pictures that 
      seemed to me the least as well as the most racist in their representation 
      of Jim.</P>
      <P>We begin with E.W. Kemble, who not only was the first illustrator to 
      bring the image of "Jim" into visual existence, but who also went on from 
      that job to specialize as <A 
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/huckfinn/kemblec.html">a 
      professional illustrator in "Negro drawings,"</A> as he called them in the 
      essay he wrote in 1930 on "Illustrating <I>Huckleberry Finn</I>." In what 
      he says there we hear a racism so deeply held and so naive that it is not 
      even faintly aware of itself, especially when he talks about the white boy 
      whom he hired to pose for all the book's characters, and how much that boy 
      enjoyed impersonating "Jim": "he would jam his little black wool cap over 
      his head, shoot out his lips and mumble coon talk" (to see <A 
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/huckfinn/colophon.html#a">Kemble's 
      essay, click here</A>). The way he depicts Jim is wholly consistent with 
      this conception, as can be seen in these examples:</P>

      src="jim_files/85jimdra.jpg" width=121></A></CENTER>
      <P>Unfortunately, as Kemble unfortunately puts it, "my coons caught the 
      public fancy." He remained the definitive interpreter of "Jim" for over a 
      generation. Webster &amp; Co. used 43 of his drawings in the 1891 "Cheap 
      Edition" of <I>Huck Finn</I>. He was hired by Harpers to provide three 
      more polished illustrations for the 1898 edition of the novel as part of a 
      multi-volume set of MT's works. (These were also used, along with a fourth 
      illustration, in the American Publishing Company's <A 
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/huckfinn/deluxillhp.html">1899 
      "Édition de Luxe"</A> <I>Huck Finn</I>.) Again in 1899 Kemble was hired by 
      the <I>New York World</I> to do three new pictures as part of the paper's 
      Christmas tribute to MT. Only one of Kemble's 1898 drawings depicts Jim: 
      he's watching Huck practice his impersonation of a girl. I've paired this 
      <I>below</I> with the "Negro drawing" Harper's used for a frontispiece: 
      Huck's arrival at the Phelpses'. Jim is in all three of the drawings he 
      did for the <I>World</I>. Two feature him, in particularly <A 
      name=a>demeaning moments,</A> as you can see by <A 
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/huckfinn/99world1.html">clicking 
      here</A>.</P>

      <P>As late as 1930 seventeen of Kemble's 1885 illustrations, including six 
      of Jim, were used in a new children's edition of the novel brought out by 
      Goldsmith Publishing Co. as part of the RedStar Classics Series. And in 
      1933 the Limited Editions Club published a lavish version of the novel 
      which included all of Kemble's original illustrations; for <A 
      href="javascript:Start('1933jim.jpg')">the title page of this edition</A> 
      Kemble did one last drawing of Jim, sandwiched between Huck and Tom, and 
      looking at the novel. Since Jim is illiterate (it was against the law in 
      Missouri to teach slaves to read) Kemble might have meant for him to be 
      looking at the pictures; if so, you have to wonder what he would have said 
      about the way he's drawn.</P>
      <P>The next American illustrator to treat the novel was Worth Brehm, who 
      did thirteen full-page illustrations for a 1923 Harper &amp; Brothers 
      edition. Only one of his drawings included Jim, but I've paired it with 
      Brehm's version of Nate, the slave Huck and Tom meet at the Phelpses'.</P>

      <P>Norman Rockwell illustrated the novel in 1940 for the Heritage Press. 
      Here are his only two pictures of Jim. The full-color illustration is one 
      of the most common depictions of Jim. I have not found an illustration 
      that depicts Jim at what to me is his best, most fully human moment, when 
      in Chapter 16 he accuses Huck of being "trash" for mistreating his friend, 
      but when you look through the various illustrated editions of the novel 
      you keep coming across scenes of Jim on his knees with the hairball.</P>

      <P>Thomas <A name=b>Hart Benton</A> included <A 
      href="http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/huckfinn/benton.html">Huck and 
      Jim in the mural</A> he painted at the Missouri State Capitol in 1936 and 
      so made a slave trying to escape from Missouri a visible part of the 
      state's past. But Jim as he drew him in the illustrations he prepared for 
      the 1942 Limited Editions edition of <I>Huck Finn</I> was less impressive 
      -- more the stereotypical "uncle" than a man.</P>
      <CENTER><A href="javascript:Start('jimill09.html')"><IMG height=130

      src="jim_files/jim1942b.gif" width=120></A></CENTER>
      <P>Another scene the illustrators loved to depict is the moment when Jim 
      first sees Huck on Jackson's Island, and falls to his knees in the belief 
      that he is being haunted by a ghost. Here is that moment as depicted by 
      Zansky, illustrator of the <I>Classics Comics</I> version of the novel 
      which came out in 1946. I've paired it with the title page, which as far 
      as I can tell is the earliest edition of the novel to use the image of 
      Huck and Jim together on the raft to define the story. That iconography -- 
      the white boy, the black slave, the raft on the river -- has become 
      probably the most familiar visual way to identify the novel; many modern 
      paperback covers, and posters for the musical <I>Big River</I>, use the 
      image.</P>

      <P>For the Rainbow Classics Series, the World Publishing Company hired 
      Baldwin Hawes to illustrate the novel in 1947. He too drew the scene of 
      Jim and the hairball, but chose for the frontispiece a representation of 
      Huck and Jim on the raft.</P>

      <P>In 1948 Grosset &amp; Dunlap brought out <I>Huck Finn</I> in the 
      Illustrated Junior Library, with over ten full-page and fifty half-page 
      illustrations by Donald McKay. The one on the left is from Chapter 12; on 
      the right, from Chapter 39.</P>

      <P>When Doubleday brought out the novel as a Doubleday Classic in 1954, 
      they hired Richard M. Powers to do 43 black-and-white half-page 
      illustrations for the chapter heads. Jim is in 13 of them, including the 
      one below, which I've paired with the one color illustration Powers did, 
      for the frontispiece: </P>

      <P>The Macmillan edition in 1962 put Jim on the raft with Huck on the 
      cover, but the black-and-white illustrations by John Falter still seem to 
      conceive "Jim" more as a caricature than as a character. The left-hand 
      picture is the familiar one of Jim and Huck as a ghost; the other is from 
      the very end, after Tom gives Jim $40 for playing prisoner so well.</P>

      <P>In 1963 Grosset &amp; Dunlap brought out an edition of the novel as the 
      third volume in its new Hardy Boys Favorite Classic</B> series (the other 
      available titles are <I>Tom Sawyer</I> and Stevenson's <I>Treasure 
      Island</I>). The book's <A 
      href="javascript:Start3('jimhb6301.html')">cover illustration</A> puts two 
      white boys (presumably Frank and Joe Hardy) on the raft. Inside are eleven 
      black-and-white drawings, including three with Jim in them. Below left: 
      the first representation of Jim, when he sees Huck's ghost on Jackson's 
      Island. Below right: the final representation, as he plays his part as a 
      "prisoner of style" in the Evasion Tom produces at the Phelps'. </P>

      <P>In 1978 Harper &amp; Row brought out in one volume <I>The Complete 
      Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn</I>, with illustrations by Warren 
      Chappell. His choice of the scene where Jim sees a "ghos'" aligns his work 
      with the tradition Kemble began, but in other drawings he indicates how 
      that tradition had changed:</P>
      <CENTER><A href="javascript:Start('jimill21.html')"><IMG height=130

      src="jim_files/jim1974b.gif" width=120></A></CENTER>
      <P>Finally, as a Centennary Edition in 1985, the University of California 
      Press brought out a text with 49 wood engravings by Barry Moser. The 
      first, captioned "Jim," is for Chapter 2; the second, "Never Saying a 
      Word," for Chapter 12.</P>
      <CENTER><A href="javascript:Start('jimill23.html')"><IMG height=130 
      src="jim_files/jim7.gif" width=120></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A 
      href="javascript:Start('jimill24.html')"><IMG height=130 
      src="jim_files/jim8.gif" width=120></A></CENTER>
      <P>Clearly Moser "sees Jim" as a person of great dignity. But which 
      artist's work most faithfully <I>illustrates</I> the novel's text? How do 
      MT's words represent Jim -- as a character or a caricature? These remain 
      questions that readers must answer for 
themselves.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>
