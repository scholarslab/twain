The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story --- that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.

<A NAME="text3"></A>Dealing with the role of magic in HF, Daniel Hoffman claims "a
subtle emotional complex binds together <I>superstition:
slaves:  boyhood freedom</I> in Mark Twain's mind."<A
HREF="view2.html#three">1</A>We know how
Twain felt about boyhood freedom - his nostalgia for it lead
him to some of his finest writing, and it lends its charm to
his most enduring works, <I>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</I>
and <I>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</I>.  How Twain felt
toward slaves is more ambiguous.  In
his autobiography Twain wrote of "Uncle Dan'l", the man on
whom the character Jim was based, that his "sympathies were wide
and warm" and that his "heart was honest and simple and knew no
guile" (Autob., 2.)  To the time spent on his uncle's
farm in Florida, Missouri Twain credited his "strong liking
for his [Uncle Dan'l's] race and...appreciation of certain of
its fine qualities" (Autob., 3.)  To the late-twentieth-century
reader, of course, Twain's treatment of blacks is extremely
problematic.  Jim's character presents many difficulties --  are
we to think of Jim as the man who longs for his family even as
he valiantly runs away from them or the fool who gains
celebrity among the slaves for a story he invents and
believes?  How could Twain allow Jim to assert his human dignity on
the raft, then subject him to a series of gross humiliations at
the Phelps farm?  Definitive answers to these questions are
impossible.  However they and the fact that they must
remain unresolved affect all conclusions we draw about Twain
and his black characters.

In considering superstition, the third part of this triangular
relationship, we are again left with questions about Twain's
feelings.  In <I>Form and Fable in American Fiction</I>, Daniel
Hoffman writes that "Twain's usual assumption is that white
persons of any status higher than trash like Pap have little
knowledge of, and no belief in, superstition" <A
HREF="view2.html#four">2</A> Superstition
is mainly for slaves and boys.  It is important to
note that within the framework of <I>Huck Finn</I>, dissociating a
thing from white culture is by no
means casting it in poor light.  In fact when put under the
scrutiny of Huck's honest narration, white culture suffers
badly.  Miss Watson, though "good", is harsh and unkind.  The
King and Duke think nothing of tricking the Wilks girls out of
their inheritance; even the Grangerfords, who are "quality",
partake in a vicious and deadly feud.  The brutalities that
Huck witnesses - Buck's killing, Boggs' murder - are committed
by whites.  Although Pap has superstitions, folk beliefs in the
story belong to Huck and Jim, the characters we most trust.
<P>
While incidents like Jim begging mercy from the "ghost" Huck and Nat and the
witch pie are clearly intended to make the reader laugh at the
ignorance of the believers, are we not somehow left in the end
with the idea that the zealous followers of superstition are
somehow safer than their Christian counterparts?
<P>
In <I>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</I> "a boy of German
parentage" memorizes eight or ten thousand bible verses but
goes mad from the effort.  In <I>Huck Finn</I> the Shepherdsons
and Grangerfords go to church with their guns.  On the other side, the slaves
"come from all around" to see the five cent piece which
they and Jim believe was given to him by the devil.  We as readers know
that the slaves  have been duped by their own superstition and by
Tom's mischief, but are we convinced that they are worse off than the people at the
camp meeting who donate a total of $87.75 to that scoundrel,
the King, for his mission in the Indian Ocean?
