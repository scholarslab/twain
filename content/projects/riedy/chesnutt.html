DURING A recent visit to North Carolina, after a long absence, I took occasion to inquire into the latter-day prevalence of the old-time belief in what was known as "conjuration" or "goopher," my childish recollection of which I have elsewhere embodied into a number of stories.  The derivation of the word "goopher" I do not know, not whether any other writer than myself has recognized its existence, though it is in frequent use in certain parts of the South.
<P>
The origin of this curious superstition
    itself is perhaps more easily traceable.
    It probably grew, in the first place, out
    of African fetichism, which was brought
    over from the dark continent along with
    the dark people. Certain features, too,
    suggest a distant affinity with Voodooism, or snake worship, a cult which
    seems to have been indigenous to tropical America. These beliefs, which in the
    place of their origin had all the sanctions
    of religion and social custom, become, in
    the shadow of the white man's civilization, a pale reflection of their former
    selves. In time, too, they were mingled and
    confused with the witchcraft and ghost
    lore of the white man, and the tricks
    and delusions of the Indian conjurer.
    In the old plantation days they flourished vigorously, though discouraged by
    the "great house," and their potency was
    well established among the blacks and
    the poorer whites. Education, however,
    has thrown the ban of disrepute upon
    
    witchcraft and conjuration. The stern
    frown of the preacher, who looks upon
    superstition as the ally of the Evil One;
    the scornful sneer of the teacher, who
    sees in it a part of the livery of bondage,
    have driven this quaint combination of
    ancestral traditions to the remote chimney corners of old black aunties, from
    which it is difficult for the stranger to
    unearth them. Mr. Harris, in his Uncle
    Remus stories, has, with fine literary
    discrimination, collected and put
    into pleasing and enduring form, the
    plantation stories which dealt with animal lore, but so little attention has been
    paid to those dealing with so-called conjuration, that they seem in a fair way to
    disappear, without leaving a trace behind. The loss may not be very great,
    but these vanishing traditions might
    furnish valuable data for the sociologist,
    in the future study of racial development.   In writing, a few years ago, the
    volume entitled <I>The Conjure Woman</I>,
    
    I suspect that I was more influenced by
    the literary value of the material than by
    its sociological bearing, and therefore took, or thought I did, considerable
    liberty with my subject. Imagination,
    however, can only act upon data-one
    must have somewhere in his consciousness the ideas which he puts together to
    form a connected whole. Creative talent,
    of whatever grade, is, in the last analysis,
    only the power of rearrangement -- there
    is nothing new under the sun. I was the
    more firmly impressed with this thought
    after I had interviewed half a dozen old
    women, and a genuine "conjure doctor";
    for I discovered that the brilliant touches, due, I had thought, to my own imagination, were after all but dormant
    ideas, lodged in my childish mind by old
    Aunt This and old Uncle That, and
    awaiting only the spur of imagination
    to bring them again to the surface. For
    instance, in the story, "Hot-foot Hannibal," there figures a conjure doll with
    pepper feet. Those pepper feet I regarded as peculiarly my own, a purely
    original creation. I heard, only the other
    day, in North Carolina, of the consternation struck to the heart of a certain dark
    individual, upon finding upon his door-step a rabbit's foot -- a good omen in
    itself perhaps -- to which a malign influence had been imparted by tying to
    one end of it, in the form of a cross, two
    small pods of red pepper!
    <P>
    Most of the delusions connected with
    this belief in conjuration grow out of
    mere lack of enlightenment. As primeval
    men saw a personality behind every
    natural phenomenon, and found a god
    or a devil in wind, rain, and hail, in lightning, and in storm, so the untaught man
    or woman who is assailed by an unusual
    ache or pain, some strenuous symptom
    of serious physical disorder, is prompt
    
    to accept the suggestion, which tradition
    approves, that some evil influence is
    behind his discomfort; and what more
    natural than to conclude that some rival
    in business or in love has set this force
    in motion?
    <P>
    Relics of ancestral barbarism are
    found among all peoples, but advanced
    civilization has at least shaken off the
    more obvious absurdities of superstition. We no longer attribute insanity to
   demoniac possession, nor suppose that a
    king's touch can cure scrofula. To many
    old people in the South, however, any
    unusual ache or pain is quite as likely to
    have been caused by some external evil
    influence as by natural causes. Tumors,
    sudden swellings due to inflammatory
    rheumatism or the bites of insects, are
    especially open to suspicion. Paralysis is
    proof positive of conjuration. If there is any doubt, the "conjure doctor" invariably removes it. The credulity of ignorance is his chief stock in trade -- there is
    no question, when he is summoned, but
    that the patient has been tricked.
    <P>
    The means of conjuration are as
    simple as the indications. It is a condition of all witch stories that there must
    in some way be contact, either with the
    person, or with some object or image
    intended to represent the person to be
    affected; or, if not actual contact, at least
    close proximity. The charm is placed
    under the door-sill, or buried under the
    hearth, or hidden in the mattress of the
    person to be conjured. It may be a crude
    attempt to imitate the body of the victim, or it may consist merely of a bottle,
    or a gourd, or a little bag, containing a
    few rusty nails, crooked pins, or horse-hairs. It may be a mysterious mixture
    thrown surreptitiously upon the person
    to be injured, or merely a line drawn
    across a road or path, which line it is
    
    fatal for a certain man or woman to cross.
    I heard of a case of a laboring man who
    went two miles out of his way, every
    morning and evening, while going to and
    from his work, to avoid such a line drawn
    for him by a certain powerful enemy.
    <P>
    Some of the more gruesome phases
    of the belief in conjuration suggest
    possible poisoning, a knowledge of which
    baleful art was once supposed to be
    widespread among the imported Negroes
    of the olden time. The blood or venom of
    snakes, spiders, and lizards is supposed
    to be employed for this purpose. The
    results of its administration are so peculiar, however, and so entirely improbable, that one is supposed to doubt even
    the initial use of poison, and figure it in
    as part of the same general delusion.
    For instance, a certain man "swelled up
    all over" and became "pieced," that is,
    pied or spotted. A white physician who
    was summoned thought that the man
    thus singularly afflicted was poisoned,
    but did not recognize the poison nor
    know the antidote. A conjure doctor,
    subsequently called in, was more prompt
    in his diagnosis. The man, he said, was
    poisoned with a lizard, which at that very
    moment was lodged somewhere in the,
    patient's anatomy. The lizards and
    snakes in these stories, by the way, are
    not confined to the usual ducts and cavities of the human body, but seem to
    have freedom of movement throughout
    the whole structure. This lizard, according to the "doctor," would start from
    the man's shoulder, descend to his hand,
    return to the shoulder, and pass down the side of the body to the leg. When it
    reached the calf of the leg the lizard's
    head would appear right under the skin.
    After it had been perceptible for three
    
    days the lizard was to be cut out with a
    razor, or the man would die. Sure enough,
    the lizard manifested its presence in the
    appointed place at the appointed time;
    but the patient would not permit the
    surgery, and at the end of three days
    paid with death the penalty of his obstinacy. Old Aunt Harriet told me, with
    solemn earnestness, that she herself had
    taken a snake from her own arm, in sections, after a similar experience. Old
    Harriet may have been lying, but was,
    I imagine, merely self-deluded. Witches,
    prior to being burned, have often confessed their commerce with the Evil
    One. Why should Harriet hesitate to
    relate a simple personal experience which
    involved her in no blame whatever?
    <P>
    Old Uncle Jim, a shrewd, hard old
    sinner, and a palpable fraud, who did
    not, I imagine, believe in himself to any
    great extent, gave me some private
    points as to the manner in which these
    reptiles were thus transferred to the
    human system. If a snake or a lizard be
    killed, and a few drops of its blood be
    dried upon a plate or in a gourd, the person next eating or drinking from the contaminated vessel will soon become the
    unwilling landlord of a reptilian tenant.
    There are other avenues, too, by which
    the reptile may gain admittance; but
    when expelled by the conjure doctor's
    arts or medicines, it always leaves at the
    point where it entered. This belief may
    have originally derived its existence
    from the fact that certain tropical insects
    sometimes lay their eggs beneath the
    skins of animals, or even of men, from
    which it is difficult to expel them until
    the larvae are hatched. The chico or
    "jigger" of the West Indies and the Spanish Main is the most obvious example.
    <P>
    Old Aunt Harriet-last name uncertain, since she had borne those of her
    master, her mother, her putative
    father, and half a dozen husbands in
    succession, no one of which seemed to
    take undisputed precedence-related
    some very remarkable experiences. She
    at first manifested some reluctance to
    speak of conjuration, in the lore of
    which she was said to be well-versed;
    but by listening patiently to her religious
    experiences-she was a dreamer of
    dreams and a seer of visions -- I was
    able now and then to draw a little upon her reserves of superstition, if indeed
    her religion itself was much more than
    superstition.

    "W'en I wuz a gal 'bout eighteen er
    nineteen," she confided,

de w'ite folks use' ter sen' me ter town ter
    fetch vegetables. One day I met a' ole conjuh
    man name' Jerry Macdonal', an' he said
    some rough, ugly things ter me. I says, says
    I, "You mus' be a fool." He did n' say
    nothin', but jes' looked at me wid 'is evil
    eye. W'en I come 'long back, date ole man
    wuz stan'in' in de road in front er his house,
    an' w'en he seed me he stoop' down an'
    tech' de group', jes' lack he wuz pickin' up
    somethin', an' den went 'long back in 'is
    ya'd. De ve'y minute I step' on de spot he
    tech', I felt a shatp pain shoot thoo my right
    foot, it tu'n't under me, an' I fell down
    in de road. I pick' myself up' an' by de time
    I got home, my foot wuz swoll' up twice its
    nachul size. I cried an' cried an' went on
    fer I knowed I'd be'n trick' by dat ole man.
    Dat night in my sleep a voice spoke ter me
    an' says: "Go an' git a plug er terbacker.
    Steep it in a skillet er wa'm water. Strip it
    lengthways, an' bin' it ter de bottom er yo'
    foot." I never didn' use terbacker, an' I
    laid dere, an' says I ter myse'f, "My Lawd,
    w'at is dat, w'at is dat!" Soon ez my foot
    got kind er easy, dat voice up an' speaks
    ag'in: "Go an' git a plug er terbacker.
    Steep it in a skillet er wa'm water, an' bin' it ter de bottom er yo' foot." I scramble'
    ter my feet, got de money out er my pocket,
    woke up de two little boys sleepin' on de
    flo', an' tol' 'em ter go ter de sto' an' git
    me a plug er terbacker. Dey didn' want
    ter go, said de sto' wuz shet, an' de sto'
    keeper gone ter bed. But I chased 'em
    fo'th, an' day found' de sto' keeper an'
    fetch' de terbacker-dey sho' did. I soaked
    it in de skillet, an' stripped it 'long by
    degrees, till I got ter de een', w'en I boun'
    it under my foot an' roun' my ankle. Den
    I kneel' down en' preyed, en' next mawnin'
    de swelin' wuz all gone! Dat voice wus de
    Spirit er de Lawd talkin' ter me, it sho'
    wuz! De Lawd have mussy upon us, praise
    his Holy Name!

    Very obviously Harriet had sprained
    her ankle while looking at the old man
    instead of watching the path, and the hot
    fomentation had reduced the swelling.
    She is not the first person to hear spirit
    voices in his or her own vagrant imaginings.
<P>
    
    On another occasion, Aunt Harriet's
    finger swelled up "as big as a corn-cob."  She at first supposed the swelling to be
    due to a felon. She went to old Uncle
    Julius Lutterloh, who told her that some
    one had tricked her. "My Lawd!" she
    exclaimed, "how did they fix my finger ?"
    He explained that it was done while in
    the act of shaking hands. "Doctor"
    Julius opened the finger with a sharp
    knife and showed Harriet two seeds at
    the bottom of the incision. He instructed
    her to put a poultice of red onions on the
    wound over night, and in the morning
    the seeds would come out. She was then
    to put the two seeds in a skillet, on the
    right hand side of the fire-place, in a
    pint of water, and let them simmer nine
    mornings, and on the ninth morning
    she was to let all the water simmer out, and when the last drop should have
gone, the one that put the seeds in her hand was to go out of this world! Harriet, however, did not pursue the treatment to the bitter end. The seeds, once
    extracted, she put into a small phial,
    which she corked up tightly and put
    carefully away in her bureau drawer.
    One morning she went to look at them,
    and one of them was gone. Shortly
    afterwards the other disappeared. Aunt
    Harriet has a theory that she had been
    tricked by a woman of whom her husband of that time was unduly fond, and
    that the faithless husband had returned
    the seeds to their original owner. A part
    of the scheme of conjuration is that the
    conjure doctor can remove the spell and
    put it back upon the one who laid it.
    I was unable to learn, however, of any
    instance where this extreme penalty had
    been insisted upon.
    <P>
    It is seldom that any of these old
    Negroes will admit that he or she possesses the power to conjure, though those
    who can remove spells are very willing
    to make their accomplishment known,
    and to exercise it for a consideration.
    The only professional conjure doctor
    whom I met was old Uncle Jim Davis,
    with whom I arranged a personal interview. He came to see me one evening, but
    almost immediately upon his arrival a
    minister called. The powers of light
    prevailed over those of darkness, and
    Jim was dismissed until a later time, with
    a commission to prepare for me a conjure "hand" or good luck charm, of which, he informed some of the children
    about the house, who were much interested in the proceedings, I was very
    much in need. I subsequently secured
    the charm, for which, considering its
    potency, the small sum of silver it cost me
    was no extravagant outlay. It is a very
    small bag of roots and herbs, and, if used
    according to directions, is guaranteed
    to insure me good luck and "keep me
    from losing my job." The directions
    require it to be wet with spirits nine
    mornings in succession, to be carried on
    the person, in a pocket on the right hand
    side, care being taken that it does not
    come in contact with any tobacco. When
    I add that I procured, from an equally
    trustworthy source, a genuine graveyard
    rabbit's foot, I would seem to be reason-
    ably well protected against casual misfortune. I shall not, however, presume
    upon this immunity, and shall omit no
    reasonable precaution which the condition of my health or my affairs may
    render prudent.
    <P>
    An interesting conjure story which I
    heard, involves the fate of a lost voice.
    A certain woman's lover was enticed
    away by another woman, who sang very
    sweetly, and who, the jilted one suspected, had told lies about her. Having decided upon the method of punishment
    for this wickedness, the injured woman
    watched the other closely, in order to
    find a suitable opportunity for carrying
    out her purpose; but in vain, for the
    fortunate one, knowing of her enmity,
    would never speak to her or remain
    near her. One day the jilted woman
    plucked a red rose from her garden, and
    hid herself in the bushes near her rival's
    cabin. Very soon an old woman came
    by, who was accosted by the woman
    in hiding, and requested to hand the red
    rose to the woman of the house The
    old woman, suspecting no evil, took
    the rose and approached the house, the
    other woman following her closely, but
    keeping herself always out of sight. When
    the old woman, having reached the door
    and called out the mistress of the house,
    delivered the rose as requested, the
    recipient thanked the giver in a loud
    voice, knowing the old woman to be
    somewhat deaf. At the moment she
    spoke, the woman in hiding reached up
    and caught her rival's voice, and clasping
    it tightly in her right hand, escaped,
    unseen, to her own cabin. At the same instant the afflicted woman missed her
    voice, and felt a sharp pain shoot through
    her left arm, just below the elbow. She
    at first suspected the old woman of having tricked her through the medium of
    the red rose, but was subsequently
    informed by a conjure doctor that her
    voice had been stolen, and that the old
    woman was innocent. For the pain he
    gave her a bottle of medicine, of which
    nine drops were to be applied three times
    a day, and rubbed in with the first two
    fingers of the right hand, care being
    taken not to let any other part of the
    hand touch the arm, as this would
    render the medicine useless. By the aid
    of a mirror, in which he called up her
    image, the conjure doctor ascertained
    who was the guilty person. He sought
    her out and charged her with the crime
    which she promptly denied. Being
    pressed, however, she admitted her guilt.
    The doctor insisted upon immediate
    restitution. She expressed her willingness, and at the same time her inability to comply-she had taken the voice, but
    did not possess the power to restore it.
    The conjure doctor was obdurate and at
    once placed a spell upon her which is
    to remain until the lost voice is restored.
    The case is still pending, I understand;
    I shall sometime take steps to find out
    how it terminates.
    <P>
    How far a story like this is original,
    and how far a mere reflection of familiar
    wonder stories, is purely a matter of
    speculation. When the old mammies
    would tell the tales of Brer Rabbit and
    Brer Fox to the master's children, these
    in turn would no doubt repeat the fairy
    tales which they had read in books
    or heard from their parents' lips. The
    magic mirror is as old as literature. The
    inability to restore the stolen voice is
    foreshadowed in the Arabian Nights,
    when the "Open Sesame" is forgotten.
    The act of catching the voice has a
    simplicity which stamps it as original,
    the only analogy of which I can at present think being the story of later date,
    of the words which were frozen silent
    during the extreme cold of an Arctic
    winter, and became audible again the
    following summer when they had thawed
    out.
