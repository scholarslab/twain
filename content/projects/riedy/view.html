Literature</H2>

<P> Folklore lore holds a very important place in the
literature of turn-of-the-century America.  The 1880's and
1890's saw a strong movement among folklorists to record the
beliefs and lore of former slaves.  The scientific study had
its literary counterpart; at the same time writers like Charles
Chesnutt and Joel Chandler Harris were creating a body of work
which incorporated these beliefs and folktales.  <P> An
especially important connection can be made between Mark Twain,
Joel Chandler Harris, and Missouri folklorist Mary Alicia Owen:
all three wrote stories in which lore is transmitted from slave
or former slave to white child.  Early in his <I>Adventures</I>
Huck Finn comments that the slaves were "always talking about
witches in the dark by the kitchen fire" (HF, 8.)  If this is
true, then it is equally true that white children are in the
kitchen as well, listening to that talk. <A NAME="text1"></A>In
<I>Mark Twain's America</I>, Bernard DeVoto points out that
"between a boy and a white man was the barrier of age, but
<A HREF="equal.html">the
slave met the boy as an equal</A>, instructing him and sharing with
him what the whites denied him because of his age."<A
HREF="view.html#one">1</A> The bond that resulted included a
sharing of stories, and through them, beliefs.  That these
stories and beliefs had their effect cannot be questioned; it
is to them that we owe much of what is good in Harris and no
small part of what is good in Twain.  Years and miles removed
from his childhood in Missouri, Twain wrote in his
autobiography, "I can hear Uncle Danl telling the immortal
tales which Uncle Remus Harris was to gather into his books and
charm the world with, by and by" (Autob., 14.)

<P> In <I>Folk
Beliefs of the Southern Negro</I>, Newbell Niles Puckett shows
that the majority of African-American folklore can be traced
back to European roots.  Much of it was adopted by slaves from
their white masters and made to fit the slave culture.
 Puckett terms these beliefs "mental heirlooms."
<A HREF="view.html#two">2</A>  While these notions gradually faded from the white
community, they persisted among blacks and were blended with African
lore and Christianity, forming a complex system of beliefs.

<P> It is interesting to note that this lore was handed down
again -- this time from blacks to whites.  This transmission
figures not only in the history of the lore but came to be a
part of the literary narratives themselves.  Owen's <A
HREF="texts.html">Tow Head</A> and Harris' <A HREF="texts.html">Little Boy</A> act as willing recipients of these "mental heirlooms."
