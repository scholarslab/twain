</PRE>
AUNT MYMEE had been in what Granny designated as "a
    turr'ble takin'," the cause of which was the loss of her most
    powerful fetich, the luck-ball she had talked to and called by
    her own name as if it were her double. Her superstitious
    terrors when she discovered the loss were really pitiable; her
    overbearing manner towards the other negroes quite forsook
    her, her limbs were palsied and her complexion bleached to that
    awful greyish pallor so much more shocking to the beholder
    than the lividness of a Caucasian. She had missed the precious
    ball in the morning, when she was dressing herself, and hastily
    felt in her bed, expecting to find it there. Not finding it, she
    snatched off the covers and shook the pillows vigorously. The
    floor was next scrutinised. No ball could be found. Then Aunt
    Mymee went wild. Her morning duties were forgotten, she ran
    hither and thither, looking in all possible and impossible places
    of concealment and obstinately refusing to state what she had
    lost. Finally, with a groan of despair, she flung herself down
    on her cabin floor in a cowering heap and quavered out that
    she would be better off in her grave, for an enemy had stolen
    her luck-ball, and her soul as well as her luck was in it.
    <P>
    Her daughter's pickaninnies, in great excitement, spread the
    news, but scarcely had Granny and Aunt Mary begun to enjoy
    it when they had " ter laff out o' turr side o' de mouf "; Tow Head proudly marched to the cabin with an exceedingly dirty
    little bag in her hand and desired to know if Aunt Mymee's
    soul was " tied up in that nasty thing ? "
    <P>
    Evidently it was. Aunt Mymee sprang up with a joyful cry
    and kissed the bag and hugged the finder, then sternly demanded-
 <P>
    "Huccome dat yo' got dat medout me a-knowin'? "
    <P>
    " Found it by my bed this morning."
    <P>
    " Oh ! honey, w'yn't yo' fetch um ri' off ? "
    <P>
    " I didn't see you. Mamma dressed me this morning."
    <P>
    " Did yo"'-Mymee's voice sank to an anxious whisper-
    " sho\v dat ball unter 'er? "
    <P>
    " No," said Tow Head, with great positiveness, "I didn't.
    She told me, once, wherl I was telling her about Uncle John's
    Jack, <I>never</I> to say anything more about such wicked idol-ertry,
    and I promised I wouldn't, and I always keep my promises-if
    I don't forget. Grandma says that is my best trait."
    <P>
    Aunt Mytnee heaved a sigh of relief.
    <P>
    "Dat's er good chile, don't pesteh yo' ma," she said, approvingly, as she began to fumble at the strings wrapped (not tied) round the neck of the dirty bag that had raised such a commotion.<A HREF="luckb.html#one">1</A><A NAME="text1"></A>
    <P>
    " What are you doing, Aunt Mymee ? "
    <P>
    " Gwine ter gib Lil Mymee er drink. Dat wut she arter, I
    reck'n, w'en she bust loose. I ain't gun 'er no drink sence er
    week ergo de day 'fo'yistiddy, an' she boun' ter hab one wunst
    er week. I wuz dat tuk up wid new-fangle noshins dat I fegit
    'er, an', lo an' beholes ~ wut does I git foh hit ? "
    <P>
    " Shall I bring you a gourd of water ? "
    <P>
    "No, honey. Lil Mymee, she don' sup watteh," said Aunt
    Mymee, lifting a dirty little yarn ball out of the dirty little linen bag. " She sup wut Big Angy name <I>eau-de-vie</I>, an' dat sholy am de watteh ob life foh huh, kase ef she don' git un she die."<A HREF="luckb.html#two">2</A><A NAME="text2"></A>
    <P>
    Aunt Mymee produced a black bottle of Little Mymee's
    elixir of life, better known to the general public as whiskey, and
    proceeded to moisten, first the ball, then herself therewith; after
    which ceremony she restored the ball to its proper receptacle,
    mended the broken string, which had been the cause of its loss,
    and made it an ornament to her person by slinging the string
    over her left shoulder and under her right so that the ball rested
    under her right armpit. She had, beforehand, be it understood,
    slipped out of the various waists of her raiment, so that the ball
    should lie against her naked body, with no intervening fold of
    calico or flannel to absorb its "strenk."
    <P>
    How that ball was made, what were its components, Tow
    Head did not, at that time, know, though she gathered from
    the half-whispered gossip of the other aunties that it was the
    work of " King " A---  a Voodoo doctor or cunjurer of great
    powers and influence.
    <P>
    This A---  was a curious half-barbarian, who never stayed
    long in a place, made his entrances secretly and mysteriously in
    the night, never confided in any one, never spent money for
    anything but whiskey, never lacked for the good things of this
    world, and never was reduced to the inconvenience of begging
   or stealing, although he was as the lilies of the field "that toil
    not, neither do they spin." No cabin refused him shelter and
    the best bed and food it could afford. No one knew whence
    he came or whither he was going. When four taps were heard
    above the latch, some one flew to usher in the guest. "A--- 's
    dar " was the unspoken conviction. How he came was a matter
    of conjecture; it was generally conceded that he travelled at his
    ease on some strange steed of the devil's providing.
    <P>
    As soon as he was settled in his temporary quarters - that is,
    had eaten of everything in the larder, drunk generous potations of whiskey, and taken possession of the best chair - a messenger was sent out "to pass the word around" that he had
    arrived.
    <P>
    In the course of the night the answer came in the persons of
    scores of darkies, some of them from a distance of many miles,
    who eagerly purchased his remedies, charms and " tricks."
    <P>
    When she was a child Tow Head never once caught sight of
    him, but in after years she had more than one interview with
    this " king" of occult " cussedness." When she saw him her
    disappointment was extreme. There was nothing royal either
    in his appearance or demeanour. He was, as he is, a black,
    sweaty, medium-sized negro, half-naked, altogether innocent of
    soap, and not dispensing the perfume of Araby the blest.<A HREF="luckb.html#three">3</A><A NAME="text3"></A> His eyes were snaky, his narrow forehead full at the eyebrows but
    shockingly depressed above. His nose was broad and with a
    flatness of nostrils emphasized to the perception of the beholder
    by the high, bony ridge that divided them. His chin was narrow and prominent; at first glance, it seemed broad by reason
    of the many baggy folds that surrounded it after the fashion of
    a dew-lap. He was far from beautiful when his features were
    in repose, but the time to fully realise that he was a self-chosen
    disciple of his Satanic Majesty was when he unclosed his great
    rolling lips in a silent laugh. The yawning cavern thereby disclosed, with its double guard of yellow, broken, "snaggy" teeth
    set in gums unwholesomely red, and its ugly, wriggling tenant,
    a serpent-like tongue, were, in themselves, more awe-inspiring
    than any charm or curse that issued therefrom.
    <P>
    When Tow Head saw him she meekly asked for some talisman to insure good luck to a friend.
<P>

    " Fetch me," said the ogre, " er ha'r ur two fum de body o' de
    one dat wants de luck, an' er dollah, an' I mek yo' er luck-ball."
    <P>
 Tow Head explained that the " ha'r " could not be obtained.  The friend was on the other side of the ocean.
    <P>
  "Den fetch de money an' I kin hate red clobeh (clover) stan'
    in de place o'de ha'r."
    <P>
    Tow Head " fotch " the dollar and then, as she demonstrated
    that she was something of a witch herself, by repeating the
    formula she had learned from Aunt Mymee for preparing a
    "tricker-bag," she was not only furnished the ball but, in addition, was taught how to make it.
    <P>
    This is one way to prepare a " tricker-bag ": --
    <P>
    Take the wing of a jaybird, the jaw of a squirrel, and the
    fang of a rattle-snake and burn them to ashes on any red-hot
    metal. Mix the ashes with a pinch of grave-dust-the grave of
    the old and wicked has most potency in its earth-moisten with
    the blood of a pig-eating sow; make into a cake and stick into
    the cake three feathers of a crowing hen wrapped with hair from
    the head of the one who wishes an enemy tricked. Put the
    cake into a little bag of new linen or cat-skin. Cat-skin is better
    than linen, but it must be torn from the haunch of a living cat.
    Whatever the bag is, it must be tied with a ravelling from a
    shroud, named for the enemy and then hidden under his house.
    It will bring upon him disease, disgrace, and sorrow. If a whipporwill's wing is used instead of a jay's it will bring death.
    <P>
    " Dat's toll'ble," A-- declared. " Des toll'ble. Thee
    (three) am er good numbeh, but fo (four) am betteh in de
    makin'up ob tricks. Good lan'!<A HREF="luckb.html#four">4</A><A NAME="text4"></A> I de daid deyse'fs got ter mine
    de fos (fours) ef yot mek um plenty nuff. Fo' time fo' time fo'
    (4 x 4 x 4) am de gret numbeh. De daid an' de debbils gotter
    mine dat. Des see me mek dis hyeah luck-ball en' kote (quote)
    um in."
    <P>
    A-- spread his materials, consisting of red clover, dust,
    tinfoil, white yarn, and white sewing-silk, on a table, called for a bottle of whiskey, and, when the last-named necessity of
    modern " cunjerin " was produced, proceeded to business. He
    broke off four lengths of yarn, each length measuring about
    forty-eight inches. These were doubled and re-doubled into
    skeins of four strands each and spread in a row before him.
    To each skein was added forty-eight inches of sewing-silk folded
    as the yam was.
    <P>
    " Dar now I " he said, " De silk am ter tie yo'frens unter yo',
    de yahn am ter tie down all de debbils. Des watch me tie de
    knots. Hole on dough !-dis fust! "
    <P>
    The "fust " proceeding was to fill his mouth with whiskey.
    Then ensued a most surprising gurgling and mumbling, as he
    tied a knot near the end of the skein nearest him. As it was
    tightened, he spat about a teaspoonful of tobacco-perfumed
    saliva and whiskey upon it.
    <P>
    " Dar now! " he said, "dat's er mighty good knot. Dey
    ain't no debbil kin git thu dat."
    <P>
    " Stop! Stop!   You are not dealing fairly with me. You
    promised that I should hear your incantation, and you mumble
    so that I cannot distinguish a word."
    <P>
    " Ise a-kotin in (quoting in) de name o' de one de ball am foh.
    Des wait twell I git thee (three) mo' knots tied in dis hank an'
    den I kote out loud foh de turrs."
    <P>
    Sure enough, when the mumbling, spitting, and tying had
    been repeated three times, he laid down the skein, took up the
    second one, filled his mouth with whiskey, began to tie a knot,
    and said- .
    <P>
    " Gord afo' me' Gord ahine me, Gord be wid me. May dis
    ball fetch all good luck ter Charles Leland. May hit tie down
    all debbils, may hit bine down 'is innemies afo' 'im, may hit
    bring um undeh 'is feet. May hit bring 'im frees in plenty,
    may hit bring 'im faithful frens, may hit bine um to 'im. May
    hit bring 'im honeh (honour), may hit bring 'im riches, may
    hit bring 'im 'is haht's <I>de</I>sire. May hit bring 'im success in
evveht'ing he hondehtakes, may hit bring 'im happiness. I ax
    foh hit in de name ob de Gord."
    <P>
    This he repeated four times, then spat upon the knot, took a
    fresh drink of whiskey, began on a second knot and repeated the
    whole performance, exactly as he did also when he tied the third
    and fourth knots. When this second skein had its four knots
    tied, he laid it against the first. Before the two had lain several
    inches apart.
    <P>
    " Now," said he, " ef yo' gotter fair membunce (an' I reck'n
    yo' has, kase yo' look lak er ooman strong in de haid, er mighty
    strong ooman in de haid) I 'low dat yo' knows dat chahm off by
    haht. Dat's yo' look out dough, kase I ain' gwine ter holler hit
    no mo'. Ise gwine ter say hit sorf (soft) w'iles I ties de fo' knots
    in dem urr two lil hanks."
    <P>
    When the muttering and spitting at length ceased, and four
    little skeins with four little knots in each lay side by side, Tow
    Head asked-
    <P>
" What is the use of tying all those knots ? "

<P>
" Dem knots! W'y dem knots am in fo's (fours) an' dey tie down all de debbils -- debbils is 'fraid o' fo' time fo' time fo'.
    Likeallwise, de knots bine yo' frens unter yo'. Dey ain't no
    debbil kin git thu dem knots."
    <P>
    " What is all that other stuff for ? "

    "Stuff!" the "cunjer-man's" tone was indignant. "Des
    wait twell dat <I>stuff</I> git a-wuhkin'. Dat ar piece ob file (foil)
    rupisent (represents) de brightness ob dat lil spurrit dat gwine
    ter be in de ball, dat clobeh am in de place ob de ha'r offen
    de one dat
 ter own de ball, dat dus'am innemies'dus,'
    en' hit am ter bline de eyes ob de innemies."
    <P>
    So saying, he drew three of the skeins towards him, twisted
    them into a little nest and gave them a copious bath of saliva
    and whiskey.
    <P>
    " It seems to me that conjuring is mostly whiskeying."
    <P>
    'Dey's er heap o' pennunce (dependence to be placed in)
    whiskey, sholy, dough in de outlandish kyentry fum whurs dey
    fetch de niggehs in de fust place, dey tek some sort ob greens
    an' putt um in er gode (gourd) wid watteh an' set um in de sun
    twell dey wuhk (work-ferment), an' dat go in de place ob
    whiskey.''<A HREF="luckb.html#five">5</A><A NAME="text5"></A>
<P>

    Tow Head would fain have asked other questions, but the
    " king " waved his hand to enjoin silence. Again he had
    recourse to the whiskey-bottle, and once more he began to murmur his incantation, pausing only to spit upon the red clover
    blossoms and the encircling leaves and upon the tinfoil, as he
    placed them in the little yarn nest and sprinkled them liberally with
    enemies' dust -- a powder that looked as if he had picked it up at
    a gas-house, although he declared it was dust gathered where
    the river sand and the clay of the bank met. Suddenly, with a
    dramatic flourish, he plunged his hand into his bosom and drew
    forth a ball of white yarn. From this he began to wind the
    thread about the little woollen nest, all the time keeping up
    the muttering of the incantation and the attendant punctuation
    of saliva and whiskey. In a few minutes, he had made a new
    ball of a little over an inch in diameter. This was a "luck-
    ball." He held it suspended by a length of yarn and began to
    talk to it in most caressing tones.
    <P>
    " Promuss dat yo'll be er good ball."
    <P>
    The string began to twirl as if unwinding.
    <P>
    " Dat's right I I know'd yo'd be good."
    <P>
    " You have left out a skein," interrupted Tow Head.
    <P>
    " Dat wuz a-puppus," was the lofty reply. " Now, ef yo'
    want de good ob dis hyeah ball, yo' ain't gwine ter flusteh me
    wid queschins."
    <P>
    Tow Head was stricken dumb.
    <P>
    The "king" shut his eyes and proceeded to give an uncanny
    exhibition of ventriloquism.
<P>
" Now," said he, addressing the ball, as he dangled it between
    his thumb and finger, "yo' name is Leland, Charles Leland.
    Ise gwine ter sen' yo' er long way off unter er master, er mighty long way off, 'cross big watteh (the ocean). Go out m de
    woods an' 'fresh yo'se'f 'fo' yo' staht. Go 'long! Do yo'
    hyeah me? Is yo' gwine? Is yo' gwine way off? Is yo'
    climbin'? Is yo' climbin' high?"
    <P>
    After each question there was a series of answerings, growing
    fainter and fainter as the spirit of the ball was supposed to go
    farther and farther away.
<P>

    After the last question there was a long pause. Then "Charles
    Leland" was invited to return. As he was a long way off, the
    "king" listened attentively to the faint murmur that came in
    reply, even pressing forward the rim of his ear to catch the faint,
    far-distant answer.
    <P>
    The answer was evidently what the "king" desired, for he
    continued to question and receive replies, and each time the
    question was fainter, and the reply louder. " Is yo' stahted ?
    Is yo' comin' closter? Is yo' gittin' nigh ? Is yo' back ? Is
    yo' in de ball ergin ?"
    <P>
    All of "Charles's" replies were in the affirmative. When he
    was once more at home, he proclaimed the fact by causing the ball
    to spin and dance in the most surprising manner. When he
    finally relapsed into quietude, he had another shower-bath from
    his summoner's mouth. Then there was nothing more to be done
    but to wrap the ball in tinfoil and a little silk rag. The only
    instructions given were to place the ball in a linen bag, attach it to
    a string of flax or hemp and direct the one for whom it was
    named to sling the string over the left shoulder and under the
    right, so that the ball should rest under the right arm. From
    thence he must be taken once a week and bathed in whiskey,
    otherwise its strength would die. At any time "he" could be
    taken out and consulted or confided in. His approval or disapproval could be felt by the owner, at once, and his help
relied on if asked for. Only one warning was given. " Don't
    tie no knots in he kivvuz (covers)."<A HREF="luckb.html#six">6</A><A NAME="text6"></A>
<P>
    Just such a ball was the one Aunt Mymee lost and found.
    All her acquaintances knew as well as she did what it was to
    her; the matter was a theme of gossip all day and inspired
    Granny and Aunt Em'ly to relate stories of other and more
    precious luck-balls when evening came on.
    <P>
    Aunt Em'ly's story of Ole Rabbit's silver bubble came first.
    <P>
    " One time, de Debbil's ole ooman, des foh 'muse huhse'f an'
    pesteh folks, mek de spoht (sport) ob flingin'er silveh blubbeh
    inter de pond, an' den she gin out dat whoso git um git all de

    <P>
    " What experience, Aunt Em'ly ? "
    <P>
    " Des hole on, honey, hole back de hosses an' we git dar

 So inspiriting was this finale that everybody began to sing and "jump Jim Crow," a favourite pastime borrowed from the <I>white</I> minstrels, so far as the song, but not so far as the "exercise" was concerned.

"Fust upun de heel tap,
  <BR>  Den upun de toe.

<BR>    You jump Jim Crow.

<A NAME="one">1.  </A>This same incident also occurred almost exactly as here related to my brother -- Henry P. Leland -- when he was twelve years of age. The old black cook of the family had lost her "cunjerin' bag," when my brother found it. It contained a chicken's breastbone, ashes, and rags. -C. G.

<P>
<A NAME="six">6.  </A> ' I received this luck ball in a letter when in Copenhagen. It appeared to
    be such a mysterious or important object, that an official was specially sent
    from the post-office with it to the hotel where I was staying, and I received it
    from him. The reader may find an account of how I myself have seen luck.

<P>
<A NAME="seven">7.  </A>I think that this is probably the <I>original</I> of the Tar Baby because it corresponds more closely to the making of the magical mannikin as found in European sorcery. Thus in England it is made by putting a "fairy head" (stone, <I>echinus</I>) on a tiny body (MS. charms) and in Italy with a distaff.  Its object is the same in all to defeat or act counter to witches and evil spirits, &c. <A HREF="luckb.html#text7"><I>return to text</I></A>
